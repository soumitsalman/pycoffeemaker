            "text": "By\nChris Mellor\n- \nFebruary 7, 2025\nData orchestrator Hammerspace is challenging the conventional wisdom that object storage is the optimal solution for AI training and inference, arguing that universal, protocol-agnostic data access is far more crucial.\nIn a sense, that would be natural as Hammerspace has AI model training customers, such as Meta. Its technology is based on parallel NFS and it supports Nvidia’s GPUDirect fast file access protocol. However, Hammerspace supports S3 data access as well as file access. It has a partnership with object storage supplier Cloudian so that its HyperStore object storage repository can be used by Hammerspace’s Global Data Platform software. HyperStore supports Nvidia’s GPUDirect for object storage, designed to provide faster object access.\nMolly Presley, Hammerspace SVP for marketing, discussed the file-vs-objects AI topic with _Blocks and Files_ , and moved onto making data suitable for AI processing – vectorization and how data should be organized for the AI LLM/agent era.\n**Blocks & Files: Why is Hammerspace focused on a hybrid data platform instead of just file or object storage?**\n**Molly Presley:** In article, he calls out the pain points of parallel file systems due to their proprietary nature and needing specialized headcount. This is a huge reason why Hammerspace, with over 2,400 contributions to the Linux kernel, is so focused on a standards-based data platform. The choice for customers is not limited to just object storage if they need standards-based access without proprietary clients and silos.\nIt’s not about choosing between file systems and object storage interfaces; the conversation is also about scalability, efficiency at scale, understanding data sources, and seamlessly orchestrating data regardless of its format.\nFocusing solely on storage interfaces and file vs object storage trivializes the complexity of today’s AI demands. Each workload has different performance requirements, is connected to different applications with different storage interface requirements, and may use data sources from a wide variety of locations. The optimal platform delivers performance through orchestration, scalability, and intelligent workload-specific optimizations.\n**Blocks & Files: ****Are AI infrastructure purchase decisions primarily being made around training workloads?**\n**Molly Presley:** No. As organizations are assessing their AI investments, they are thinking beyond more than just training. Data architecture investments for most organizations need to accommodate far more than training. They need to span inference, RAG, real-time analytics, and more. Each requires specific optimizations that go beyond generic, one-size-fits-all storage systems. A data platform is needed and must adapt to each phase of AI workloads, not force them into outdated storage paradigms.\nA data platform must provide real-time data ingestion (aka data assimilation), intelligent metadata management, security, and resilience. Storage interfaces alone don’t solve the full challenge – data must be fluid, orchestrated, and dynamically placed for optimal performance across workloads.\n**Blocks & Files: We have been concerned about the spread of LLMs as that implies the LLMs need access, in principle, to an organization’s entire data estate. Will an organization’s entire data estate need to be vectorized? If not all, which parts? Mission-critical, near-time, archival?**\n**Molly Presley:** At Hammerspace, we don’t see vectorization as the immediate challenge or top-of-mind concern for buyers and architects – it’s global access and orchestration. Organizing data sets, ensuring clean data, and moving data to available compute are much more urgent in today’s training, RAG, and iteration workloads.\nThe need to vectorize an organization’s entire data estate is highly use-case and industry-specific. While the answer varies, full vectorization is typically unnecessary. Mission-critical and near-time data are the primary candidates, while archival data can be selectively sampled to identify relevance or patterns that justify further vectorization.\nThe key to effective implementation is enabling applications to access all data across storage types at a metadata control plane level – without requiring migrations or centralization. This ensures scalability and efficiency.\n**Blocks & Files: Will an organization’s chatbots/AI agents need, collectively and in principle, access to its entire data estate? How do they get it?**\n**Molly Presley:** Chatbots and AI agents typically don’t need access to an organization’s entire data estate – only a curated subset relevant to their function. Security and compliance concerns make unrestricted access impractical. Instead, leveraging global data access with intelligent orchestration ensures AI tools can access the right data without uncontrolled sprawl.\nEven if an organization vectorized everything, the resulting data store would be near-real-time, not truly real-time. Performance is constrained by update latency – vector representations are only as current as their latest refresh. API integration and fast indexing can help, but real-time responsiveness depends on continuous updates. Hammerspace’s relevant angle remains metadata-driven, automated orchestration rather than full-scale vectorization.\n**Blocks & Files: Will the prime interface to data become LLMs for users in an organization that adopts LLM agents?**\n**Molly Presley:** Good question. LLMs are rapidly becoming an important interface for data in organizations adopting AI agents. Their ability to process natural language and provide contextual insights makes them a powerful tool for accessibility and decision-making. However, they won’t replace traditional BI and analytics tools – rather, they will integrate with them. Enterprises require structured reporting, governance, and auditability, which remain best served by established standards. The near-term (next few years at least) future lies in a hybrid approach: LLMs will enhance data interaction and discovery, while enterprise-grade analytics tools ensure precision, compliance, and operational control. \n**Blocks & Files: In a vector data space, do the concepts of file storage and object storage lose their meaning?**\n**Molly Presley:** File and object storage don’t disappear; they evolve. In a vector data space, data is accessed by semantic relationships, not file paths or object keys. However, storage type still matters in terms of performance, cost, and scale.\n**Blocks & Files: ****Will we see a VQL, Vector Query Language, emerge like SQL?**\n**Molly Presley:** Yes, a Vector Query Language will emerge, though it may not take the exact form of SQL. Standardization is critical. Just as SQL became the universal language for structured data, vector search will need a standardized query language to make it more accessible and interoperable across tools and platforms.\nAPIs and embeddings aren’t enough. Right now, vector databases rely on APIs and embedding models for similarity search, but businesses will demand more intuitive, high-level query capabilities as adoption grows. Hybrid queries will be key. Future AI-driven analytics will need queries that blend structured (SQL) and unstructured (VQL) data, allowing users to seamlessly pull insights from both.\n**Blocks & Files: Can a storage supplier provide a data space abstraction covering block, file, and object data?**\n**Molly Presley:** Some storage vendors can abstract storage types across file and object, and some offer block as well – but that’s not a true global data space. They create global namespaces within their own ecosystem but fail to unify data across vendors, clouds, and diverse formats (structured, unstructured, vectorized).\nStandards are a critical part of this conversation as well. Organizations are typically unwilling to add software to their GPU servers or change their approved IT build environments. Building the data layer client interface into Linux as the most adopted OS is critical, and using interfaces like pNFS, NFS, and S3, which applications natively write to, is often mandated.\nA global data space is about universal access, not just storage abstraction. It must integrate rich metadata, enable advanced analytics, and orchestrate data dynamically – without migrations, duplication, or vendor lock-in.\nBottom line: storage type is irrelevant. Without true global orchestration, data stays siloed, infrastructure-bound, and inefficient.\n**Blocks & Files: How do we organize an organization’s data estate and its storage in a world adopting LLM-based agents?**\n**Molly Presley:** We need a tiered approach to data, organized not in traditional HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) terms of time, but with rich contextual relevance to automate orchestration of curated subsets of data non-disruptively from anywhere to anywhere when needed. \nFocus on the data, not the storage. Especially in LLM-based ecosystems, the storage type is opportunistic and workflow-driven. All storage types have their uses, from flash to tape to cloud. When the type of storage is abstracted with intelligent, non-disruptive orchestration, then the storage decisions can be made tactically based on cost, performance, location, preferred hardware vendor, etc. \nUnified access via standard protocols and APIs that can bridge all storage types and locations. This provides direct data access, regardless of where the data is today, or moves to tomorrow. In this way, data is curated in place so that applications can access the relevant subset of the data estate without requiring disruptive and costly migrations.\nThere is rich metadata in files and objects that typically is unused in traditional storage environments. Custom metadata, semantic tagging, and other rich metadata can be used to drive more granularity in the curation of the datasets. Combining these metadata into the global file system to trigger automated data orchestration minimizes unnecessary data movement, reduces underutilized storage costs, and improves accuracy and contextual insights for LLM-based use cases. \nData mobility and the ability to scale linearly are essential. LLM workflows inevitably result in data growth but, more importantly, may require cloud-based compute resources when local GPUs are unavailable. Modern organizations must put their data in motion without the complexity and limitations of traditional siloed and vendor-locked storage infrastructures.\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n### Storage news ticker – February 7\n### WEKA restructures for the GenAI era\n### Qumulo takes on mainstream data fabric suppliers\n### DataCore buys Arcastream parallel file system from Kalray\n### PEAK:AIO drives UK effort to bring down cost of medicine\n### VDURA talks up energy-efficient HPC systems for utilities\nBlocks and FilesStorages and File System News\n### ABOUT US\nBlocks & Files is a storage news, information and analysis site covering storage media, devices from drives through arrays to server-based storage, cloud storage, networking and protocols, data management, suppliers and standards.

But the bureau also handles and passes on money that Congress appropriates for other groups, including the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nThe bureau’s programs have often been focused on building up civil society and democratic practices in countries where the United States does not have missions and formal diplomatic ties, or where relations with an authoritarian government are especially tense. This includes Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nSome of the bureau’s contractors have specific technical expertise. For example, at least one is an expert on virtual private networks, software that allows users to get around government internet blocks. China has the most effective internet censorship program in the world, called the Great Firewall.\n\nThe bureau has also worked on enacting policies aimed at pressuring China to relent on its forced labor of Uyghur Muslims, including the imposing of sanctions on U.S. companies that buy products that can be traced back to some form of forced labor."

            "text": "# Land seizure and South Africa’s new expropriation law: scholar weighs up the act\n\nSouth Africa has a new law to govern the expropriation (or compulsory acquisition) of private property by government for public purposes or in the public interest.\nThe passing of the Expropriation Act 13 of 2024 followed a parliamentary process that began in 2020. \nThe act repeals the apartheid-era Expropriation Act 63 of 1975, and aims to align expropriation law with the constitution. It sets out the procedures, rules and regulations for expropriation. Besides setting out in quite a detailed fashion how expropriations are to take place, the act also provides an outline regarding how compensation is to be determined. \nIn South Africa’s colonial and apartheid past, land distribution was grossly unequal on the basis of race. The country is still suffering the effects of this. So expropriation of property is a potential tool to reduce land inequality. This has become a matter of increasing urgency. South Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land reform.\n## Property rights and land reform\nThere is much debate in the country about the provisions of the new act. The debate is mostly about the extent to which it affects existing private property rights. Some argue the act is unconstitutional. Others welcome it as a necessary step in the right direction.\nI’m a professor of law with a keen interest in this area of the law, and recently edited a book on land expropriation in South Africa by leading experts. My view is that an expropriation act that is aligned with the constitution should be welcomed, to enable land reform to work effectively.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Land reform in South Africa: what the real debate should be about ** _\n* * *\nLand reform also needs a capable and proactive state that implements the legal framework in such a manner that prioritises expropriation as a mechanism to ensure land reform.\nSo far, expropriation has not been used effectively to redistribute land more equitably, as part of land reform. \nI am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver bullet to effect large-scale land reform – at least not the type of radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs.\nUnderstandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights. But it still substantially protects landowners affected by expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be compensated. \n## Protections for land owners\nThe act says that property must not be expropriated arbitrarily or for a purpose other than a public purpose or in the public interest.\nPublic purpose means by or for the benefit of the public. For example, expropriating property to build roads, schools and hospitals. Public interest is broader and includes the nation’s commitment to land reform. \n“Arbitrary” would usually mean without reason or justification.\n* * *\n_**Read more:South Africa has another go at an expropriation law. What it's all about ** _\n* * *\nThe act further requires that an expropriating authority – an organ of state or person empowered by the act or any other legislation – must first try to reach an agreement with the owner to acquire the property on reasonable terms before considering expropriation.\nThis gives some power to a landowner, even though expropriation does not normally require consent. The act also says a specific expropriation must always be authorised by a law. \n## No compensation?\nSection 12 of the act deals with compensation for expropriation. It is arguably the most controversial part of the new legislation. Section 12(1) does not appear to be problematic and is largely the same wording as section 25(3) of the constitution. This part of the property clause sets out what must be taken into account when compensation for expropriation is determined. \nSection 12(3) of the act refers to “nil compensation” – when nil rand (monetary) compensation may be paid. There is no explicit reference to nil compensation in the current wording of section 25 of the constitution. It’s a new thing in the Expropriation Act.\nHowever, courts have toyed with the idea that section 25 of the constitution already provides room for a reduction in compensation. \nThe circumstances in which nil compensation could be granted in terms of the new act are in fact very limited. Section 12(3) leaves the discretion to the expropriating authority to determine when it may be just and equitable to pay nil compensation. However, the act lacks guidelines on how such a discretion must be exercised.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Land is a heated issue in South Africa – the print media are presenting only one side of the story ** _\n* * *\nThe scope of section 12(3) is also limited in some respects. For one, it is restricted to land. Only where land is expropriated would nil compensation be an option. Therefore, not all forms of property can be expropriated without compensation. The notion of property under section 25(1) of the constitution is generally wide and includes various rights and interests, which are broader than just land. For instance, personal rights, mineral rights and licences are included under the section 25(1) notion of property.\nThis wide understanding of property is not applicable to section 12(3), which refers to “land” being expropriated.\nSection 12(3) is also limited to the expropriation of land “in the public interest”. Nil compensation is therefore envisaged only in the context of expropriation of land undertaken in the public interest, and not also for a public purpose. \nThree of the four categories listed in section 12(3), where nil compensation is envisaged, are linked to the way in which the property was being used prior to the expropriation. Land used in a productive manner is therefore not evidently envisaged under section 12(3).\nNil compensation is not necessarily limited to the instances listed. Still, the amount of compensation must – in all instances – be just and equitable.\n## Novel approach\nThe act forces South Africans to engage with the idea of nil compensation in a much more direct manner.\nThe presence of a clause dedicated to nil compensation provides new clarity on when this could apply. \nIt is hard to determine whether this act will pass constitutional muster without seeing how expropriation under it will work in practice. It remains to be seen whether it will have the far-reaching consequences that many fear, or call for.\n_Zsa-Zsa Temmers Boggenpoel does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Québec’s religious symbols law: Appealing to the Supreme Court for real rights under the Charter\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has announced that it will hear a challenge to Québec’s secularism law, known as Bill 21. \nThe law, passed in 2019 “to affirm the laicity of the State,” restricts certain public sector employees in Québec from wearing religious symbols “while exercising their functions.”\nThose challenging Bill 21 have used a variety of legal tools to oppose a law they argue imposes discriminatory treatment, mainly on Muslim women.\nMuslim women who wear hijabs, and other visibly religious minorities, have been living with the ongoing effects of the law for more than five years. This includes the inability to be employed as a public-school teacher, government lawyer or judge, despite their expertise and training. For those who were already working in the public service while wearing a religious symbol, the law prohibits them from receiving any promotions or transfers. \nThere are also restrictions when receiving public services, specifically that a person must uncover their face. This may deter niqab- and burqa-wearing women from accessing public services that they need and deserve.\nWhen a discriminatory law is enacted, it has implications beyond the legislated text. In Québec, it has promoted the rejection of those who live visibly religious lives through violence on the streets and an insistence that they do not belong to Canadian society. \nThe exclusionary power of this law has created a culture of discrimination such that Muslim women are prohibited from wearing the clothing of their choice in employment sectors even beyond the parameters of Bill 21.\n## Overriding rights: the notwithstanding clause\nThe case is also significant because of the Québec government’s use of Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms — known as the notwithstanding clause — and Section 52 of the Québec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to shield the law from legal challenges.\nBill 21 was enacted with broad popular support in Québec. However, Canadian history is replete with examples of discriminatory laws, from the _Indian Act_ to the _Chinese Exclusion Act_ to the legal orders authorizing Japanese internment camps. Without strict guardrails around how Section 33 can be used, Canadian governments could gain great leeway to create legislation that infringes upon Charter rights. \nTypically, a discriminatory law like Bill 21 would never withstand a constitutional challenge since the Canadian and Québec Charters protect religious freedom and the right to equality. However, because the Québec government invoked both override provisions pre-emptively — before a court could decide on the law’s constitutionality — challenging the law has become more difficult.\nThe Charter’s Section 33 is called the “notwithstanding clause” because it permits federal Parliament or provincial/territorial legislatures to make laws notwithstanding (in other words, despite) certain rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Charter. Essentially, it gives governments the power to override certain constitutional provisions. A Section 33 declaration is valid for five years, after which it ceases to have effect, unless it is renewed, as it was in the case of Bill 21. \n* * *\n_**Read more:The history of the notwithstanding clause ** _\n* * *\nDespite the predominant view among legal experts that Bill 21 is discriminatory, and a finding by the Québec Superior Court that it has a cruel and dehumanizing impact on Muslim women, the law continues to stand because courts have interpreted Section 33 to have no substantive limits.\n## Unwritten constitutional principles\nWith this case, the Supreme Court of Canada has a critical opportunity to set reasonable parameters around the use of Section 33 that will have important implications for human rights cases in the future. \nThe notwithstanding clause permits governments to override some of our most cherished Charter rights: religious freedom, equality, rights to life, liberty and security of the person, the right against unreasonable search and seizure, the right against arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to legal counsel among other rights. Therefore, there must be constitutional constraints on its use. \nSection 33 should not be viewed as a bottomless pit where rights and freedoms go to die.\nThe Canadian Constitution contains an irreducible minimum core of human rights embodied in unwritten constitutional principles that have been recognized multiple times by the Supreme Court of Canada. \nThe Supreme Court has defined unwritten constitutional principles as norms that “inform and sustain the constitutional text.” The unwritten constitutional principle most relevant to addressing Bill 21 is “respect for or protection of minorities.” The protection of minorities was a key consideration motivating the enactment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it is a fundamental norm of justice so basic that it must inform the scope of Section 33’s use.\nA CBC News report on the Supreme Court of Canada agreeing to hear arguments in a case about Québec’s Bill 21.\n## ‘Blank cheque?’\nThe unwritten constitutional principle of “respect for minorities” provides a constitutional guardrail against abuse of Section 33, which has been interpreted by judges as a constitutional blank cheque, allowing governments to reduce rights to discretionary entitlements.\nSince the notwithstanding clause lives within the Canadian Constitution itself, it must conform to the defining features of the constitutional structure. The use of Section 33 must be consistent with the fundamental “principles that define our society.” For rights to be real and meaningful — to be legal pillars that people can rely on — they must have enduring constitutional protection. \nTo achieve this, the Supreme Court of Canada needs to draw appropriate boundaries around the use of Section 33. If the notwithstanding clause continues to be viewed as an open licence for governments to pick and choose which rights they respect, one might reasonably question whether Charter rights exist at all.\n_Natasha Bakht has received funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. She has also advised the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund on their research/litigation regarding Bill 21._\n_Lynda Collins does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Burundi is losing its trees: how to break heavy charcoal use and tree clearing through climate reforms\n\nBurundi faces serious climate and environmental challenges. The biggest is the country’s overdependence on the use of biomass (firewood). The second is outdated agricultural practices that have led to deforestation. In turn this has increased the country’s vulnerability to climate shocks. \nA landlocked country on the north-eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika, Burundi is extremely poor, with 76% of the population living below the poverty line (US$2.15 per day) in 2023. It is also ranked the 22nd most vulnerable to climate change in the world.\nBurundi produces very little CO₂ (less than 0.02% of global greenhouse gas emissions). Its challenge is therefore less about reducing greenhouse gases and more about managing its vulnerability to climate change. The excessive use of biomass and deforestation make it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.\nBurundi has a history of extreme events that are considered climate-related. It has experienced severe droughts, resulting in crop failure and a 35% livestock mortality (1998-2005), as well as severe floods in 2006 and 2007.\nBut the country hasn’t developed a reliable climate change legal and regulatory framework to address the issues. It is struggling to balance strict climate regulations alongside promoting voluntary behavioural changes. \nBurundians are reluctant to adopt climate-friendly energy and agricultural practices due to a combination of factors. These include unaffordability, entrenched cultural practices in favour of biomass use and an agricultural sector largely dependent on forest clearing. \nAs a law and climate change expert, I examined in a recent paper how the government of Burundi should approach the problems of biomass dependence and deforestation. \nI set out how the government could increase voluntary compliance without threatening the livelihoods of poor, agrarian people. This requires a climate change regulatory system that is delicately balanced between appropriate coercion measures (“stick”) and sufficient encouragement and incentives (“carrot”).\nI propose that the government use financial incentives to encourage households and farmers to transition to climate-friendly practices. At the same time it would need to put in place punitive tools to deter non-compliance with these climate goals.\nBut to achieve this, it first needs to put in place a legal and regulatory framework to underpin these measures. Achieving this would establish a road map for improving climate policies in other countries in the east central African region too. \n## The sources of the problems\nFrom 2008 to 2021, Burundi’s population increased from 8 million to 12 million. This led to higher demand for firewood and arable land. Deforestation causes irregular and excessive rainfall. \nHouseholds and farmers across the country are reluctant to adopt climate-friendly energy and agricultural practices, because of cost, cultural practices and farming practices.\nFor example, about 90% of rural Burundian households use three-stone fires – a simple arrangement on the ground to balance a pot above an open fire. Nearly all (99%) of households use solid fuels like wood and charcoal as their primary fuel for cooking. Less than 2% of the population is estimated to have access to improved cookstoves which emit less smoke. \nThe agricultural sector is very heavily dependent on forest clearing. In 2020, Burundi had 465,000 hectares of natural forest, extending over 17% of its land area. In 2023, it lost 2,350 hectares of natural forest. \n## Balancing act\nThe “carrot and stick” model would use tools designed to restrict the use of biomass. For example, households and farmers that rely on biomass could be fined or their land could be seized.\nSimultaneously, the government would need to provide generous economic and financial tools for households and agricultural entities. These could include grants, tax relief on agricultural products, interest-free loans, compensation and grant schemes. \nI argue that combining these tools within a single regulatory framework would persuade stakeholders to move away from activities that have a climate impact, towards cleaner energy sources. This is an innovative idea for climate change regulation, drawing from experience in other sectors in developing countries.\nThe approach creates a synergy between punishment and persuasion. But it requires a legal basis.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Ghana is behind the curve on climate change laws: expert suggests a way to get corporations on board ** _\n* * *\n## A legal framework\nGiven the gaps in Burundi’s current climate change legal framework, reform should encompass three steps. The government needs to:\n  * enact climate legislation\n  * establish a climate change regulator\n  * institute economic incentives for climate-friendly activities and practices. \n\n\nThese steps are interlinked. But the first is the most fundamental, as it creates the foundation for the climate change legal framework and regulates all activities and practices within the climate change sector. It equally provides a legal basis for the “carrot and stick” approach.\nA legal framework would allow Burundi to: \n  * put in place punitive instruments \n  * establish a climate regulator to enforce climate control measures \n  * create the mechanisms to provide payments and incentives to individuals, households and agricultural entities to move to cleaner energy sources. These could include buying cleaner energy appliances and modern farming tools.

            "text": "# Nigeria’s plastic bottle collectors turn waste into wealth: survey sheds light on their motivation\n\nPlastic waste in Nigeria presents a dual challenge: cleaning up environmental pollution, and tapping into its economic potential. \nMany countries worldwide face similar challenges. India, for one, has chosen policies that give producers of plastic the responsibility to manage their waste. Rwanda has banned single-use plastic and promoted recycling initiatives led by communities. \nThese approaches show it’s possible to address plastic waste issues while fostering economic opportunities. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Nigeria's plastic ban: why it's good and how it can work ** _\n* * *\nIn Nigeria, informal collectors of plastic bottle waste are central to achieving both of these goals. They turn waste into monetary value. \nPrevious research has highlighted the environmental and economic benefits of collecting plastic bottle waste. There’s been less attention on what shapes perceptions of waste collection as a business, particularly in Nigeria. \nThis article explores that gap, looking at the socio-cultural, economic and environmental influences on those perceptions. \nI am a researcher in the areas of plastic waste management, environmental governance and sustainable development. My work includes studying homes made from recycled plastic bottles in sustainable community-based housing projects. \nHere I’ll be drawing from an exploratory survey conducted in the Ijebu area of Ogun State, Nigeria. Using a questionnaire, we surveyed 86 participants who had at least five years of experience in the plastic waste industry.\nThe study identified factors like education, family size, religion, gender, age, and economic dynamics as relevant to participation in the business of plastic bottle waste collection.\nUnderstanding these influences might help the government to target policies. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Nigeria is the world's 2nd biggest plastic polluter: expert insights into the crisis ** _\n* * *\n## Education level and information\nOur study found that participants with higher education levels better understood the economic benefits of plastic waste collection as a systematic form of business. The less educated participants viewed waste collection more as a hand-to-mouth way of earning a living. \nEducation programmes built into waste management campaigns could improve recognition of waste collection as a structured and profitable business opportunity and develop a business-like culture among the collectors. \n## Parenthood, family size and financial obligations\nFamily size was a factor affecting perceptions of plastic bottle waste collection as a business. People with large families saw waste collection as a feasible way to provide food, housing, education and other essentials. \nHowever, the association of waste collection with income instability highlights the need to formalise and stabilise the sector. Waste collection must be made into a sustainable and reliable business model.\n## Religion and cultural norms\nReligion and cultural beliefs emerged as influences from our survey. This was evident in the responses of people who followed African traditional religions and Islam. \nThese respondents viewed waste collection as financially feasible, aligning with religious teachings that emphasise resource management and stewardship. For example, Islamic teachings on _israf_ (avoiding wastefulness) and _zakat_ (charity) promote efficient resource use and economic activities that benefit communities. \nSimilarly, African traditional religion often emphasises communal responsibility and the sustainable use of resources. These religious principles underscore the cultural acceptance of waste collection as both a practical and a morally guided economic activity. \nOther cultural norms, such as the value placed on communal responsibility and cooperation, also influenced attitudes towards waste collection. In communities with a strong tradition of collective action, where unity and mutual support are highly valued, waste collection is often viewed as a collaborative effort. \nThese cultural norms reinforce the idea that waste collection is not just an individual task, but a collective duty that benefits the entire community. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Informal waste management in Lagos is big business: policies need to support the trade ** _\n* * *\n## Gender dynamics\nGender plays a role in perception and practice in waste collection. Our survey found that male participants were more likely than female participants to perceive this activity as a business. \nAs constrained as they are by lack of access to resources, women are involved in separating and marketing reusable items. Measures like microfinance could increase women’s engagement and business opportunities. \nThis would empower women and make waste collection a more inclusive and sustainable business. \n## Age and desire to be an entrepreneur\nPerceptions were influenced by age in our study. Younger individuals, up to 14 years old, viewed plastic bottle waste collection as a gateway to employment. Adults aged 33-38 used their experience to get better returns on the business. \nThis age-based distinction suggests that different stages of life bring unique motivations and approaches to waste collection. \nPolicy actions that support entrepreneurship at various life stages can promote long-term engagement in the industry. This will help formalise waste collection as a sustainable and profitable business. \n## Economic and social factors\nIncome opportunities affected participants’ experiences more than social factors. Oftentimes, this determined how long they stayed in the business. Those earning more were likelier to reinvest and grow, while lower earnings often led to disengagement or exit. This highlights the importance of financial incentives in shaping waste collection practices.\nSocial connections also play a role in fostering collaboration. It facilitates teamwork and the exchange of ideas, and creates a sense of shared purpose and collective outcomes among participants. \nStrengthening these economic and social bonds can formalise plastic bottle waste collection, making it a more efficient and profitable business. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Waste disposal in Nigeria is a mess: how Lagos can take the lead in sorting and recycling ** _\n* * *\n## Looking ahead\nThe study has significant application to Nigeria’s waste management industry. Adding education programmes into waste management programmes will improve people’s business skills.\nWell-coordinated intervention strategies can remove cultural and gender-specific barriers. For instance, cooperatives and microfinance may make waste collection more financially appealing. \nStrategies can also draw on cultural norms to increase community acceptance of waste collection and make it more inclusive.\n_Samuel Oludare Awobona, a doctoral student at Osun State University, Osogbo, Nigeria, contributed to this research._\n_The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Wetlands in South Africa’s Addo elephant park are in danger: what’s being done to protect them\n\n_TheAddo Elephant National Park in South Africa was established 94 years ago to protect the last 11 elephants in the Eastern Cape region. Since then, the reserve has expanded to 155,000 hectares and today it’s home to lions, leopards, rhino, buffalo and more than 600 elephants. It also has 16 rivers and 437 wetlands. Freshwater scientists Nancy Job and Dirk Roux were part of a team who co-authored the South African National Parks and South African National Biodiversity Institute’s first ever inventory of the park’s rivers and wetlands. With an inventory in place, the park is better placed to conserve wetlands for South Africa and plan for the future_.\n## What wetlands exist in the Addo Elephant National Park?\nA wetland is a piece of land that is flooded with salt or fresh water most of the time. There are 437 wetlands of different types in the Addo park. To locate all the wetlands in the park, we conducted field surveys in close collaboration with the park staff. We were blown away by the exceptionally diverse landscapes we found. These ranged from arid inland steep rocky mountains and low-lying plains to higher altitude grassy ridges to sandy shores. \nWe found wetlands that had never before been documented. These included “dune-slack” coastal wetlands. These are wetlands in low-lying hollows which collect water between coastal dunes. Their overall size is ever-changing as the dunes are shifted by winds. \nThese wetlands are a window into an underground aquifer of water held within the sand. This water is invisible from the surface, except as glimpsed through these wetlands. They may well support species unique to these dune fields, and are of national significance. \nWe discovered springs hidden within forested gorges (known locally as “kloofs”) and depression wetlands (shallow, bowl-like ponds that hold water for only a few months in the year) inside areas of thick, bushy vegetation.\nThese were revealed to us only through the care and guidance of the rangers who know the area so intimately. Memorable findings include a life-giving spring in a dry river bed, and crater-like depression wetlands on the plateaus of a mountainous area.\n## Why is it important to monitor these wetlands?\nRivers and wetlands (together with estuaries) are the most threatened and least protected ecosystem types in the country. They are also poorly documented and small in comparison with wetlands in other countries, making them difficult to detect. \nMaking an inventory of wetlands provides information about the type, condition, location, size and number of wetlands across an area, and the challenges that they face. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Wetlands are superheroes: expert sets out how they protect people and places ** _\n* * *\nThis is a first step towards managing and conserving these ecosystems. With each new inventory, the park contributes to the national knowledge base. \nBy the end of an inventory project, wetlands are no longer seen as mere wet spots in the landscape, but recognised as distinct ecosystems that support their own plant and animal life. This means the park is better placed to start to plan and monitor for the best outcomes for these ecosystems and the animals they support.\n## Why are the Addo Elephant National Park wetlands so important?\nThe international treaty that protects wetlands (the Ramsar Convention) recognises the importance and critical ecological functions of small wetlands, such as those in the Addo park. In a dry climate such as South Africa’s, small wetlands play a huge role. They are water sources, and habitats or refuges for animals and people in times of drought or low rainfall. \nDuring our research, the importance and lifeline that wetlands and springs held for historical settlement in the area was obvious. On one occasion, park rangers revealed to us a spring that had been modified, perhaps excavated, and a rock wall built to pond the water for ease of collection. In this very remote location, the spring had clearly supported the people and livestock that once lived there for many years before the area was declared a national park.\n## What are the major problems affecting the wetlands?\nAbout 300 biodiversity scientists come up with a national assessment of South Africa’s biodiversity about every six years. This assessment shows that wetlands are highly threatened, meaning that almost no healthy wetlands remain. This is the case across South Africa, not just in the Addo park. \nWetlands inside national parks are just as threatened as they are outside parks. In the Addo park, this is partly explained by the fact that the park was extended in the early 2000s using land that had previously been commercially farmed.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Africa's savannah elephants: small 'fortress' parks aren't the answer – they need room to roam ** _\n* * *\nIn those areas, the natural water flow had been diverted into small dams suitable for livestock and crop farming. It was difficult for natural wetlands in the area to recover on their own.\nThe oldest section of the park, established in 1931, has experienced an ever-increasing elephant population. Elephants have a remarkable ability to transform landscapes – and wetlands. Even in large fenced parks, the movement of elephants is relatively restricted and so more elephants trample through wetlands. This raises an interesting trade-off between the conservation of these animals and that of wetlands.\n## How can the Addo wetlands be protected as the climate changes?\nThe new inventory is a baseline document for rivers and wetlands in the park. The effects of climate change can be monitored against this baseline in future. \nClimate change disrupts weather patterns. It puts a lot of pressure on water resources and freshwater ecosystems. It could mean that wetlands hold water for a shorter time in the future, due to water evaporating more quickly. Wetlands are likely to be affected by climate change with less frequent but more intense rainfall. This causes soil erosion, and less water seeps into the ground to regenerate wetlands.\nIt will become increasingly important to prevent invasive alien plants from spreading, to monitor the water-holding patterns in reference wetlands, and to monitor soil erosion and the use of water by animals.\n_(Nicholas Cole of SANParks co-authored this article)._\n_Dirk Roux receives funding from the National Research Foundation, Nelson Mandela University and South African National Parks.._\n_Nancy Job works for the South African National Biodiversity Institute.

            "text": "# The growing influence of Israel’s ultranationalist settler movement\n\nDays after taking office, as he issued executive order after executive order to change the political face of America, Donald Trump also turned his attention to the war in Gaza. \nHis proposal that Gaza should be cleared out and Palestinians should be relocated to other countries such as Egypt and Jordan has been met with outraged disbelief in many quarters. The Arab League has accused him of advocating ethnic cleansing.\nBut Trump’s statement has met with approval from far-right leaders in Israel. Influential politicians have been advocating for this “solution” for years. These include finance minister and leader of the Religious Zionist party, Bezalel Smotrich and his ideological ally Itamar Ben Gvir, leader of the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Strength) party and former national security minister.\nSmotrich responded to Trump’s utterance with the declaration that he aimed to turn the idea into an actionable policy. Ben Gvir, who resigned his ministerial position recently in response to the Israeli acceptance of the latest ceasefire deal, claimed that the evacuation of Gazans was the most “humanitarian answer” to the crisis and the only way to ensure peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. \nThe pair – and their followers in Israel – share an anti-Arab ideology and a messianic belief in the Jewish people’s right to what they call “Greater Israel”. This would be a Jewish state which would also include the West Bank, which they referred to as “Judea and Samaria”, as well as Gaza and part of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. \nThey have repeatedly called for Israel to use the war as an opportunity to reoccupy Gaza. \nThese leaders enjoy a degree of influence due to the amount of media attention they receive. But it would be a mistake to assume they represent the majority of Israelis. \nData collected in 2024 by the Pew Research Center found that 45% and 41% of Israelis expressed very unfavourable views of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, respectively. In the 2022 elections, as the combined Religious Zionist party, they won just 10.84% of the vote.\nMeanwhile, the Israel Democracy Institute found that a majority of Israelis (57.5%) support a comprehensive deal for the release of all the hostages in return for an end to the war in Gaza. \nAnd yet Israel’s ultranationalists have been able to take advantage of the changing political landscape in Israel over the past few decades and the fragile multiparty system to wield disproportionate power over a government that has depended on their support to stay afloat. \n## Israel’s rightwards shift\nDuring the 1990s, there was significant support in Israeli society for the Oslo peace process towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This culminated in the historic handshake between the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, Yasser Arafat, on the White House lawn in 1993. \nWhile support for the peace process reached a high of 72% in Israel in 1995 when Oslo II was signed, right-wing factions attempted to derail the agreements. Rabin was assassinated in November 1995 by Yigal Amir, an extremist Israeli Jew, who did not want to see the realisation of a Palestinian state. \nThe collapse of the Camp David talks in 2000, which then prime minister Ehud Barak blamed on Arafat, was followed in short order by the outbreak of the second intifada. The idea that there was “no partner for peace on the Palestinian side” became a mantra for Israeli voters, who looked to those who could guarantee their security. \nBenjamin Netanyahu, who had been prime minister from 1996 to 1999, returned to power in 2009, with the image of “Mr Security”. \nNetanyahu is now Israel’s longest serving prime minister. His masterful manipulation of the fragile political system in Israel has accounted for his longevity in power. \nBut it has also enabled a gradual shift towards the most right-wing coalition in Israel’s history. Part of that has been the Religious Zionist camp.\n## Biblical promise\nThe Religious Zionists originally formed a small minority of the broader Zionist movement in the years preceding the declaration of the State of Israel. Religious Zionists combine faith and nationalism. Their core belief is that the Jewish people have the God-given right to settle the whole of Greater Israel. \nThe West Bank in particular, but also the Gaza Strip, were the sites of many key events in biblical times and the home of a number of Israelite kingdoms. In the Bible, God promises this land to the descendants of Abraham – the Jewish people. Religious Zionists have chosen to take this literally. \nHaving failed to wield power through the parliament in the early days of statehood, the Religious Zionists sought to realise their ideology through extra-parliamentary activity. This meant establishing settlements with a view to change facts on the ground. In the aftermath of the 1967 war, the main focus of settlement building was national security, rather than religious nationalist ideology. \nBut ideology has always been a key factor for those who live in the settlements in the West Bank today – and those who vow to return to Gaza. The movement has been successful by establishing outposts and settlements in the West Bank and in getting “their people” into government. \nThe Religious Zionist camp is broad and heterogeneous, and according to recent polls now represents 22% of the Jewish population in Israel. The party’s position in holding the balance of power in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, since the election in 2022, has enabled them to gradually wield greater influence on Israeli policy both in the West Bank and the war in Gaza. \nMeanwhile many of their supporters have formed settler groups, who use violence to destabilise and displace Palestinian families living in the West Bank. \nAnd now the US president has not only backed one of their dearest dreams, to clear Palestinians from Gaza, he has removed the Biden-era sanctions on several of the most aggressive settler groups. So the recent news that Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to visit the White House next week feels particularly ominous for the fate of the Palestinian people.\n_Leonie Fleischmann does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Australia’s social media ban shows how extreme the technology debate has become – there’s a better way\n\nMiyao/Shutterstock\nThe recent decision by the Australian government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s has been received with both praise and condemnation. \nThose who approve of the proposal tend to consider that children are being exploited by egregious levels of exposure to this technology. Opponents of the ban argue that it is not proportionate to the potential harms of denying young people appropriate access to what have become integral features of everyday existence. \nThis somewhat adversarial situation falls prey to the twin perils of fatalism and disasterism. It characterises the wider conversation about how we engage with the digital world. Here, fatalism signifies a weary resignation and disasterism suggests that we are all going to hell in a handcart. More specifically, these impulses impinge directly on school policy making and practice.\nIn our Economic and Social Research Council funded research project, Teaching for Digital Citizenship, my colleagues and I have sought to uncover more nuanced accounts of how young people engage with technology by collaborating with them. \nThe students in our study pointed us away from an adversarial framing of the issue and towards the need to foster more traditional forms of democratic thought. These practices draw on a robust tradition of what’s known as education for citizenship. That is, teaching students how to be active, thoughtful and informed citizens in a democratic society. \nSuch a robust notion of education for citizenship has been championed by a range of thinkers. Most notably, the British political theorist Bernard Crick in the 1990s and the educational thinker Lawrence Stenhouse in the 1970s. They both offered ideas about educational practices that rely not on the technology, nor on corporations, but on older “analogue” traditions of critical thought and engagement in subjects.\nThe students in our project expressed anxiety and sometimes guilt that they had spent too much time on their apps. By their own estimation, they were using apps for about eight hours a day. They told us that they were working on self discipline, but struggled to maintain these habits. \nProactively, the students’ response to their own growing awareness of the grip that their apps had over their time was to try to engage in more analogue study activities, such as reading books. But they were concerned to discover that their capacity for reading was limited. Some observed that they found it challenging to read more than five pages. \nThis is not to suggest that there are only downsides to being immersed in digital life. Many students suggested that there were also huge benefits. For example, they reported that gaming helped them acquire new skills and perspective. \nThese examples illustrate the ambiguities of social media apps and their effect on those of school age. \n## Ambiguous effects\nIn many countries, schools are required to provide remedies for a whole range of social ills – and often in a manner that is of questionable relevance to the purpose of education. \nIn his Ruskin Speech in 1976, former British prime minister James Callaghan asked whether education should be more aligned with the needs of industry, especially in providing the skills for employment. Since then, education in the UK, as elsewhere, has slowly moved away from how we should live, and towards how we are to make our living. \nToday, educators accept that young people, along with the rest of us, will spend their lives entangled in a complex digital world. The task of education should therefore primarily be to act as a productive space in which students can critically reflect upon, and form judgments about that world.\nAustralian prime minister Anthony Albanese said the country’s ban would reduce the Juergen Nowak / Shutterstock\nOur research project engaged representatives from a variety of different sectors, including big tech companies, policymakers, teachers and ethicists. We also carried out an extensive survey, which highlighted that online safety and harm prevention should be prioritised within schools.\nOur insights underscore the importance of recognising and reinforcing education as a way of reflecting on the way we live – and an opportunity for providing critical distance from the dilemmas of our everyday lives. The ban on social media in Australia, or indeed on any technology, therefore misses a key consideration about the purpose of education. \nAs has been seen under governments that have restricted the internet, banning technology rather than securing students’ safety may only serve to heighten the allure of that technology. Indeed, in our discussions with the students, they frequently reported their ability to deploy virtual private networks to circumvent their schools’ firewalls.\nIn November, Australian communications minister, Michelle Rowland, claimed that “there is wide acknowledgment that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content, unfiltered and infinite”. \nI believe that this misunderstands both the problem and the solution. The actual problem is not that the content is “unfiltered and infinite”. It’s that it is highly curated to serve the profit-making objectives of tech corporations, and not the interests of children. \nThe solution, then, is not to banish the problem but to address it. Education in the digital age needs to be re-imagined as a vibrant way to reflect and critique the ways we live our lives.\n_James Conroy does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Air pollution may protect against skin cancer, finds new study – but the health risks are far more serious\n\nAir pollution might protect against the most dangerous type of skin cancer, melanoma, a new study finds. However, it’s crucial to approach these results with caution and consider the broader context of air pollution’s effects on human health.\nAt first glance, the study’s conclusion is surprising. It showed that higher levels of particulate matter (PM), so-called PM10 and PM2.5 with the numbers 10 and 2.5 referring to the size of the actual air pollutant, may have a protective effect against melanoma. \nThe researchers found that increased exposure to these air pollutants was associated with a decreased risk of developing melanoma. It’s important, though, to understand the limitations of this study and why we shouldn’t rush to embrace air pollution as a potential shield against skin cancer. \nOne of the main issues with this study is its observational design which can only show associations, not prove causation. This means that while there might be a link between higher particulate matter levels and lower melanoma risk, we can’t say for certain that air pollution is directly causing this effect. \nIt was also undertaken in one area of Italy, and there weren’t many participants compared to other studies of this type. While it’s possible that higher PM levels might block out exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the primary environmental risk factor for melanoma, this doesn’t mean that air pollution is good for our health overall.\nIt’s crucial to emphasise that air pollution is extremely harmful to human health in numerous ways. Particulate matter, especially the fine particles (PM2.5), can penetrate deep into our lungs and even enter our bloodstream. This exposure has been linked to a wide range of serious health problems, including respiratory diseases. \nAir pollution can cause or exacerbate conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems. Additionally, a lot of recent research has shown links between air pollution and cognitive decline, dementia, and other neurological disorders. \nThe list is very long here and air pollution has even been associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. In fact, long-term exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause millions of premature deaths worldwide each year, even at lower amounts of PM.\nWhile this study focused on melanoma, air pollution has been linked to increased risk of other types of skin problems, including premature ageing, hyperpigmentation (a skin condition that causes patches of skin to darken) and exacerbation of dermatological conditions like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. \nIt’s also worth noting that the potential reduction in UV exposure due to air pollution doesn’t make it a safe or desirable alternative to proper sun protection. There are much healthier ways to protect ourselves from harmful UV radiation, such as using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing and seeking shade during peak sunlight hours. Prevention is, after all, better than treatment or a cure.\n## Risks far outweigh the benefits\nAlthough this study provides an interesting perspective on the complex relationship between environmental factors and melanoma risk, it should not be interpreted as evidence that air pollution is beneficial for our health. To the researchers’ credit, they do mention some of the limitations and issues with their own work in the paper. \nThe potential slight reduction in melanoma risk, if confirmed by further research in larger studies and in other locations, would be far outweighed by the numerous and severe health risks associated with exposure to air.\nIt’s important that we all continue to advocate for cleaner air and support policies that reduce air pollution. The overall benefits of clean air for our health, the environment and quality of life are immense and well established. At the same time, we should maintain good sun protection habits to reduce our risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. \nFuture research may help us better understand the complex interactions between environmental factors and cancer risk, but for now, the message is clear: clean air is crucial for our health, and there are no shortcuts when it comes to protecting ourselves from both air pollution and UV radiation.\n_Justin Stebbing does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Art, music and science combine at a new whale exhibition at Winchester Cathedral\n\nUniversity of Southampton, CC BY-NC-ND\nThe nave of Winchester Cathedral in Hampshire is, until February 26 2025, home to three monumental ambassadors from the sea, sculpted by artist Tessa Campbell Fraser. \nIn Campbell Fraser’s immersive art installation, three sculpted sperm whales (the largest of the toothed whales), hang from the cathedral ceiling. Toothed whales have teeth instead of the keratinous baleen that blue whales and others use to feed on tiny animals, such as krill. Sperm whales, which feed mainly on squid, are the largest predators alive today. \nTheir ecology is strange, but impressive. They are socially sophisticated, massive-brained, far-wandering, deep-diving and loud. Sperm whale clicks are the loudest biologically produced sound ever recorded. \nWhales use these strange vocalisations to echolocate as they hunt for prey and to communicate to each other. In this installation, Campbell Fraser has creatively employed sperm whale clicks to vibrate paint on the banners that hang alongside the whales in the cathedral, serving as a visual representation of sperm whale “codas”. These repetitive patterns of clicks, lasting a few seconds, have intrigued researchers since they were first recorded off North Carolina, US, in the 1950s.\nWe now know that groups of sperm whales are organised into “vocal clans” based on unique coda repertoires. These whale call signatures have probably been learned culturally, but scientists are yet to understand what they mean. \nWhile carrying out her research, Campbell Fraser referenced a multidisciplinary research collaboration that’s seeking to translate whale calls using artificial intelligence. Already, that project has discovered that sperm whale codas are far more complex than previously thought.\nThe three whale sculptures (which are between three and five metres long) are made, in part, from “ghost gear” – this is abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gear, collected at sea by British charity Ghost Fishing UK. Floating ghost gear, which includes fishing nets, can kill or entangle marine life such as whales. \nAt the opening of the exhibition, Campbell Fraser recounted reports of stranded sperm whales whose stomachs were filled with plastic debris. One sperm whale that was found dead in Pas-de-Calais, France, had 25kg of debris, including nets and rope, in its stomach.\nDespite this lethal backstory, Campbell Fraser’s method of construction gives the whales an ephemerality and lightness. This seems at odds with their mass in real life, for sperm whales can weigh 45 tonnes, but it is apt considering they are nearly weightless in water. This has allowed baleen whales to evolve such massive bodies. Blue whales are the largest animals to have ever lived, despite feeding almost exclusively on tiny krill.\nThese three sperm whales are on exhibition until 26 February 2025. The University of Southampton., CC BY-NC-ND\nUsing netting in these sculptures represents, on one level, the increasing effects of humans on the ocean and whales. On another level, it hints at the long entanglement between human history and whales. Our spiritual, cultural and intellectual links with whales are represented through rich intersections of art and science. \nOne famous literary example is the 1851 novel Moby Dick by Herman Melville, which artfully weaved descriptions of whale biology with the human story of pre-industrial whaling. This theme is also explored by our colleague Philip Hoare in his book Leviathan (2009). \nUnfortunately, people have negative effects on the oceans. The consequences of pollution, overfishing and climate change are widespread and increasing. Even in the furthest corners of the sea, whales may encounter humans or be affected by our influence, through climate change, noise and plastic pollution. \nOur research has shown how whale foraging areas in the remote western Antarctic peninsula overlap with an increasing fishery for Antarctic krill which now requires urgent and careful management to ensure its sustainability for people and whales.\nThrough an unprecedented compilation of over 1,000 tracks from eight whale species globally, we have produced a world-first map of “whale superhighways” – the blue corridors whales use as they migrate across oceans. This map also highlights how these extensive migrations expose whales to a mosaic of threats at various scales. As a result, protecting whales requires coordinated effort at local and global scales.\n## The art of acoustics\nOf course, scale is a key consideration in the design of cathedrals. Winchester is a particularly fine example – at 170m, it is the longest medieval cathedral in the world. \nOn February 6, four composer-performers from the University of Southampton’s department of music will perform a specially commissioned, site-specific piece called Echolocations. The music will approach this intersection of art and scientific research from another angle, in part by responding to the expansive acoustics of the cathedral.\nVocalist Liz Gre and pianist Ben Oliver, with live electronics performed by Pablo Galaz and Drew Crawford, will work with this acoustic to evoke the vast aquatic distances across which whales communicate.

            "text": "# Rachel Reeves’ route to economic growth is a slow one – and there are no guarantees voters will be patient enough\n\nGo My Media/Shutterstock\nAfter six months of talking down the economy and warning of tough times ahead, the UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has changed her tune. She is now much more optimistic about Britain’s economic prospects and has announced a raft of measures including major pension reforms designed to unlock cash to boost growth and productivity. \nBut Labour’s political problem is that none of her plans will have an immediate impact on the UK’s anaemic growth rate – the economy has virtually flatlined for the last six months. From day one Reeves has put growth at the centre of her plans, and a lack of it will mean tough choices in the spring, when she must spell out government spending plans for the next three years.\nThe government is focusing on a wide range of “supply side” reforms, including unleashing pension funds to invest in Britain, as well as relaxing the planning system and building infrastructure – many of which have an uncanny resemblance to measures once proposed by former prime minister Liz Truss. \nAt the heart of these plans is a big increase in investment in infrastructure to boost productivity – things like roads, public transport and technology – where Britain lags behind its major rivals.\nBut there’s a big catch. The independent spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), estimates that it will take years – or even decades – for infrastructure projects to transform the British economy, with only a 0.1% boost in growth in the near term for every additional 1% on public investment. \nWithout other measures that have a more immediate impact, the political risk to Labour is that its pledge to make everyone better off may feel hollow to voters.\nThe challenges are particularly acute for big transport projects, as the debacle of HS2 illustrates. Even with changes to the planning system, work on expanding Heathrow airport is unlikely to start before 2030. And major projects like the Lower Thames crossing between Kent and Essex and the Sizewell C nuclear reactor in Suffolk have been in the planning stage for nearly 20 years. \nElectricity supply is another crucial area, with the need for more renewable energy and an expansion of the grid. This will now need to be financed largely by private capital as the government has scaled back its “green new deal”.\nSo how exactly will all these big plans be financed? The government is hoping to unleash additional investment from the UK pension fund industry, by changing the rules to allow defined benefit (sometimes called final salary) schemes with surpluses to invest more widely. \nAlthough there is currently £160 billion available in these schemes, this could change if interest rates fall. It is also not clear how attractive such UK infrastructure investment would even be. Many projects, such as in privatised industries like water and electricity, will at least partly be funded by increased charges to consumers. \nThe government’s own spending plans to increase public investment are relatively modest. These plans bring government capital spending (which allows for borrowing under the fiscal rules) just slightly above the historic average.\nPlanning reform could also prove problematic. Although the government is changing some of the rules, especially in relation to housebuilding, planning decisions will be still made by local authorities. In many cases these will face strong local opposition, potentially delaying decisions. \nThis points to the larger political problem for the government. The changes will not eliminate the tension between the government’s growth and environmental objectives, with the latter potentially a crucial issue in many of the marginal seats won by Labour in the last election.\nHeathrow expansion will put the government’s climate targets in serious jeopardy. Dinendra Haria/Shutterstock\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has described the need to pull out the “weeds” of regulation as vital to growth plans. He has already sacked the head of the key regulatory agency, the Competition and Markets Authority. But allowing more consolidation of British industry could create monopolies, which tend to raise prices, increase profits and neglect investment. \nThere are even greater concerns over possible deregulation of the financial sector, which could abolish many of the safeguards established after the global financial crisis in 2008.\n## What’s missing?\nThe government is much less clear on what it is going to do about the supply of skilled labour than the availability of capital. Shortages of skilled workers could limit progress on these big infrastructure projects if workers are also needed to build housing. \nGovernment plans for boosting skills training, and the funding for further and higher education, are still works in progress. Meanwhile, limits on immigration will reduce the number of skilled construction workers. And the details of the government’s plan to boost the labour force by getting more people on disability benefit back to work have yet to be spelled out.\nAs Labour sets out its long-term growth plan, dark clouds are looming. In particular, in global terms the British economy is one of the most dependent on international trade and investment. But most of its trade is with its two largest trading partners – the EU and the USA. \nGrowing protectionism in the US, coupled with a lack of access to EU markets caused by Brexit, could have a significant effect on Britain’s growth. The UK economy is projected by the IMF to grow by just 1.6% this year, which is still weak by historic standards.\nIt may be of little consolation to the public if this is higher than in France and Germany. Reeves may well find that’s simply not enough to satisfy the expectations of voters.\n_Steve Schifferes does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# We studied more than 500 giraffe skulls from all over Africa – and confirmed there are 4 distinct species\n\nGiraffes are among the world’s most recognisable animals. With their elongated necks and long legs, their gracious movements and unique coat patterns, they have inspired people’s imaginations for centuries.\nBut is a giraffe just a giraffe? Or is there more variety between the animals at a genetic level than is evident just from looking at them? \nFor more than a decade many researchers have compared the DNA of giraffes from all parts of Africa. These studies have revealed that there are four distinct giraffe species: the southern (_Giraffa giraffa_), Masai (_Giraffa tippelskirchi_), reticulated (_Giraffa reticulata_), and northern (_Giraffa camelopardalis_) giraffe. \nDifferent giraffe species face different risks. Some are among the most threatened large mammals in the world. While the southern and the Masai giraffe are relatively numerous and their populations estimated at approximately 45,000 and 50,000 individuals respectively, the situation does not look quite as rosy for the reticulated and the northern giraffe. Based on the latest estimates from the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF), only 16,000 and 6,000 individuals respectively remain in the wild.\nTherefore, it is critical to verify whether there are indeed different species of giraffe or not so that direct conservation efforts for the most threatened species can be increased before it’s too late.\n* * *\n_**Read more:How many giraffe species are there? Understanding this is key to their protection ** _\n* * *\nThe concept of species is fundamental in biology – but there is no consensus on its definition. There are many different approaches depending on individual scientists’ points of view. The best possible way to clarify the taxonomy (the system that organises living entities into groups) of organisms is through multiple approaches. \n* * *\n_**Read more:Giraffes could go extinct – the 5 biggest threats they face ** _\n* * *\nThere have been several studies of giraffe species based on their DNA, as well as on their ecology, behaviour, health and coat patterns. \nBut there haven’t been many based on their skulls. That’s where our new study comes in. By examining the skulls of more than 500 giraffes from across the African continent, we were able to show that there are significant differences in the skull shapes of the different types of giraffe – and confirm that there are four species. \nThese new findings are crucial for giraffe taxonomy and, ultimately, their conservation.\n## How the study was done\nGiraffe skulls are important to the animals’ reproduction and evolution. That’s because of their ossicones, the horn-like structures that are longer and wider in males than in females.\nThe size and shape of the ossicones is important in the dominance of males and their mating success with female giraffe. While some preliminary data already suggested some potential differences in the ossicone morphology between the giraffe species, limitations on the available specimens and the methodologies at the time reduced the validity of the results. \nFor our research we used state-of-the-art equipment and methodologies, and we studied more than 500 giraffe skulls from all over Africa. The skulls were directly sampled in the field from across their natural range in Africa, as well as museum collections, wildlife authority offices, and taxidermists in different countries in Africa, Europe and the US. \nMap showing the geographical range of the extant giraffe species and subspecies as well as representative male skulls of each subspecies in lateral view. Kargopoulos et al 2024, CC BY\nThis extensive study required help from many different partners. While the project was initiated and guided by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation and the University of Cape Town, many colleagues in Africa, Europe and North America contributed. \nWe used a handheld 3D scanner to capture the skulls’ shape in 3D. Then we used 3D geometric morphometrics methods to compare the shape of the giraffe skulls and find out if we could group them and find any significant differences. We chose so-called landmarks – specific points on the skulls – and captured their coordinates in space (their 3D distance from the centre of mass of the skull). \nFinally, specialised software was used to compare the differences in the coordinates of landmarks between our specimens and to conduct statistical analyses to show if these differences were significant or not. \n## Skull variations\nThese rigorous analyses allowed us to show skull variations between four species.\nThese differences mostly concerned the ossicones. But there were also minor differences in their face, eye sockets, the region around the teeth, and the back part of the skull. \nThe most striking difference concerned the median ossicone of the males. This is a smaller third ossicone situated in the midline of the skull above their eyes. We determined that there is a general trend in the size and shape of this ossicone that follows geography and taxonomy. In southern giraffe, the third ossicone is practically a small protrusion; in northern giraffe it is large and pointed; the Masai and reticulated giraffe have ossicones that are somewhere between those two forms.\nSuch differences are likely important in the way individuals of a species recognise each other, thus affecting their reproductive success. Males with more developed ossicones intimidate their rivals to gain access to territory and females. \n## Attention for individual species\nOur study is confirmation of what scientists have known for almost a decade and supports the taxonomic split of the giraffe. \nSimilar discussions over two decades finally resulted in the African elephant being split into two distinct species in 2021. \nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – which, it must be pointed out, is not a taxonomic authority – still only recognises one species of giraffe. It lumps all giraffes into one broad, threatened Red List category. \nWe strongly believe that the IUCN needs to stand tall for these animals and reassess their status. It is time for each giraffe species to get separate and enhanced attention, both locally and internationally, in particular when it comes to their conservation. Giraffes and their wild habitats must be protected before it’s too late.\n_The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# Will Labour’s plan for growth actually work? Two economists respond\n\nCeri Breeze/Shutterstock\nThe UK chancellor Rachel Reeves says the Labour government will go “further and faster” to kick-start the British economy. Economic growth – to raise living standards and fund public services – is apparently a core mission  of this government. \nYet since the general election last July, this growth has proved elusive. \nIn fairness, the UK economy been pretty stagnant for a long time. And as Reeves sometimes mentions, she arguably inherited the worst set of economic circumstances since 1974. \nNevertheless, the government has been guilty of some major own goals. The means-testing of winter fuel payments drew derision, while the public framing of a “painful” budget in October 2024 dented business and consumer confidence. \nSo after a difficult first six months in office, the chancellor’s big speech on January 29 was an opportunity for a major economic reset. And there were some signs of encouragement.\nShe reaffirmed, for example, a commitment to reforming the UK’s antiquated planning laws for residential and commercial building. And there was a big emphasis on public investment, which is to rise to 2.6% of GDP over this parliament, compared to the previous government’s plans of 1.9%. \nAirport expansion at Heathrow (and to a lesser extent, Luton and Gatwick) aims to enhance global connectivity and increase trade and investment, especially with emerging economies. \nBut those plans, which run counter to the government’s net zero goals, unsurprisingly sparked the ire of environmental campaigners, as well as some senior Labour MPs and party donors. \nThey may also widen the UK’s regional inequalities, drawing more investment and economic activity to the south-east. The same goes for the notion of building Europe’s “Silicon Valley” between Oxford and Cambridge. \nThat said, some other regions may benefit from announcements which included a £28 million investment in Cornish Metals (for materials for solar panels and wind turbines), and £63 million for advanced fuels which should bring more high-skilled jobs to areas like Teesside. There were also plans for housing and commercial redevelopment around Old Trafford in Manchester. \nSome of these projects will form part of the government’s new industrial strategy, which is expected in the spring. \n## Red tape restrictions\nOne word to look out for when that strategy is unveiled is “Brexit”, which continues to act as a drag on the UK’s growth. Yet in her speech, while Reeves used the “growth” word more than 50 times, she mentioned Brexit just once. \nIt deserves much more attention. For investment in the UK has been lacklustre since the 2016 referendum, and research shows that post-Brexit red tape has hampered exports, especially for smaller firms. Overall, the UK’s exports of goods are down by 9% since 2020, while similar economies have seen their exports rise by 1%. \nThere are government plans for more wind turbines. Nuttawut Uttamaharad/Shutterstock\nThe chancellor has previously suggested a Brexit “reset”, and there may be a future a deal to ease some Brexit agri-food trade barriers. Reeves has also floated the possibility of the UK joining a “Pan-Euro” customs zone. \nOther moves which might help UK manufacturing include a bill that would allow the government to keep pace with new EU product safety regulations, and anything else which avoids new administrative costs for businesses. \nYet despite the government perhaps adopting a more conciliatory tone with the EU, there are frustrations with the UK’s “red lines”, such as a refusal to agree to a scheme which would make it easier for young EU citizens to travel, work and study in the UK, and for young UK nationals to do the same in EU member states. \n## Execution\nAnd while the chancellor’s speech highlighted the government’s long-term ambitions for growth, there was little to address current weaknesses quickly. \nFor despite a change to Labour’s self-imposed fiscal rules last autumnn, the government still faces significant public borrowing constraints. This will restrict the amount of investment required to fundamentally transform public infrastructure, without major private sector support. \nAnd planning reforms, infrastructure projects, and new trade deals all take time and face political, legal and logistical hurdles. This will also delay growth. \nLabour’s ambitions for a more pro-growth, pro-business agenda mark a positive shift, at least in tone. But actual, visible, tangible growth depends on execution. This in turn depends on private sector money, overcoming bureaucratic hurdles, and cutting the Brexit red-tape that continues to hamper trade with the EU. \nWithout effective action across the board, including immediate fiscal stimulus, the chancellor’s words may begin to sound a little hollow if the mission for growth soon starts to look like mission impossible.\n_Phil Tomlinson receives funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for Made Smarter Innovation: Centre for People-Led Digitalisation._\n_David Bailey receives funding from the Economic and Social Research Council's UK in a Changing Europe Programme._"

            "text": "# Growing ‘anti-gender’ movements are trying to restrict  equality and sex education in schools around the world\n\nhxdbzxy/Shutterstock\nThe start of a new Trump presidency in the US may well signal the introduction of policies that limit the knowledge children can access in schools. \nAlready, districts in states across the US are able to ban books from schools and libraries, often on topics such as race and LGBTQ+ identities. And during the presidential campaign, Trump said that he would withhold federal funding from schools that “recognise transgender identities”. \nBut these kinds of limits on education are not only present in the US. Across the world, there are concerted efforts to control who can access education and what children can learn in schools. \n“Anti-gender” movements reject the social changes that come from an increase in rights for women and LGBTQI+ people. They promote a social order based on patriarchal gender norms, heterosexual marriage and a binary understanding of gender. They target schools because education has unique potential to influence social norms and attitudes for the long term. \nThese movements are funded largely by conservative foundations and individuals, largely in the US and Europe. They work together to disrupt children’s educational opportunities and undermine gender equality in the global south, particularly Africa and Latin America. \nMy report, co-written with colleagues from the thinktank ODI Global, has found that this is an accelerating and well-funded trend. But it can be countered, including through the use of legislation that upholds human rights. Understanding the nature of these movements and how to counter them is vital to protect all children’s rights to a quality education.\n## Global reach\nIn the last decade, these movements have become greatly influential. They are global in reach and include politicians, foundations, think-tanks, media ecosystems, religious institutions and grassroots civil society. \nOne such group, for instance, is the multi-lingual online platform CitizenGO. It mobilises people to sign petitions and engage in letter-writing campaigns to influence policy both at national and global levels.\nIn 2017 CitizenGo sponsored an orange “anti-trans” bus that travelled through Europe and the Americas. Though the organisation boasts that it is funded by small donations, investigative research indicates it likely received seed funding from religious and far-right sources in Russia and western Europe.\nBetween 2008 to 2017, the aggregate revenue of US-based organisations linked to the anti-gender movement amounted to US$6.2 billion (£5 billion) according to research from the Global Philanthropy Project, a group of funders aiming to advance LGBTI+ rights. Over this same period, 11 US-based organisations funnelled at least US$1 billion to like-minded organisations abroad.\nIn schools, these movements focus on amplifying and manufacturing outrage around comprehensive sexuality education. \n## Stifling sex education\nComprehensive sex education has been developed to provide young people with age-appropriate and accurate information about sex, relationships, and bodily changes. It has been proven to help reduce teenage pregnancy and encourage safer, more equal sexual relationships. But it has become a lightning rod for the movement to generate fear, backlash and ignite parental protests in places as diverse as South Africa, Peru and Ghana. \nAnti-comprehensive sexuality education campaigns frame this educational content as inappropriate. They advocate for sex education based solely on “biological facts” or the promotion of abstinence. \nThey present the discussion of topics such as consent and bodily autonomy, or information on contraception and safe sex practices, as likely to encourage sexual experimentation and teenage pregnancy. This is despite as decades of evidence showing that the opposite is true.\nIn Peru, for example, the Con Mis Hijos No Te Metas (Don’t Mess with My Kids) movement started as a parental movement protesting against inclusion of gender equality material in the basic education curriculum. The movement’s campaigns have spread to oppose comprehensive sexuality education in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.\nStudents head to school in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A. M. Teixeira/Shutterstock\nWith long-term flexible funding, the anti-gender movement can respond to emerging policies and situations. It can wage long-term campaigns to shift norms and policies.\nIn regions such as Africa and Latin America, one of the most successful tactics has been to deploy anti-colonial language. This includes painting comprehensive sexuality education or acceptance of homosexuality as being imposed by “the west”. \nHowever, funding from conservative US and European foundations designed to entrench certain gender norms and forms of sexual morality in Latin America and Africa can equally be considered as a form of neo-colonialism. Between 2007 and 2020, over US$54 million was spent on the African continent by US-based Christian groups, supporting campaigns against LGBTQ+ rights and comprehensive sexuality education.\nAnother key tactic is the dissemination of misinformation, exploiting parental anxieties and fears. These include exaggerated claims that often bear little relation to the actual content of curricula and learning materials. \nHowever, our research has found that in countries where legal frameworks and systems uphold human rights, legal action can protect access to a full and effective education. \nFor example, strategic litigation has overturned state laws in Mexico and Brazil that restricted sexuality education. Legal approaches have also ended policies that banned adolescent mothers from returning to school in Sierra Leone.\nCountering misinformation about what is taught in schools is vital. This can involve sharing accurate information about topics such as sexuality education with parents, and usually works best as part of a face-to-face dialogue.\n_CitizenGO did not respond to a request for comment by the time this article was published._\n_This research was funded by a grant to ODI Global from Global Affairs Canada._"

            "text": "# Bird flu cases surging in UK but risk to humans remains low\n\nAvian influenza control zones have been put in place in England, Scotland and Wales to control the virus's spread among birds. AlanMorris/ Shutterstock\nA human case of bird flu has recently been detected in England. This news comes just days after restrictions were put in place to curb the virus’s spread among wild birds and poultry in England and Scotland. \nAlthough cases of bird flu are surging among birds in the UK, the risk of the virus spreading to humans still remains extremely low. A bit of context about influenza explains why health protection agencies think this is the case. \nThere are many different influenza viruses out there. They’re all related, but each specialises in infecting different types of animals. \nEach winter, humans have to deal with three different types of seasonal influenza virus – H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B viruses. Meanwhile, birds, particularly shore birds and waterfowl, contend with a huge number of their own influenza viruses. \nMost of these avian influenza viruses only afflict birds with minor infections of the airway or gut. But a small set cause more serious illness. These are called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs).\nAmong the HPAIVs, the H5N1 strains stand out. H5N1 bird flu, which is largely a disease of wild birds, has been notorious since the late 1990s for causing major die-offs of poultry worldwide – and for occasionally causing serious illness in humans. Viruses evolve rapidly, and in 2020 H5N1 evolved so it could spread more aggressively in wild birds. \nThe resulting outbreak tore through bird populations globally, including devastating die-offs in seabird colonies when the virus arrived in the UK in 2021. As it spread, the virus also caused outbreaks in farmed birds. \nAll outbreaks ebb and flow. After mid-2023, cases of H5N1 subsided in the UK. However, the virus never fully disappeared – and in autumn 2024, cases in wild birds started increasing again. It’s very hard to keep wild birds and farmed birds apart, and infections in poultry farms soon followed.\nIn the UK, the threat of H5N1 to birds is tracked through ongoing surveillance. In response to these rising cases, avian influenza prevention zones have recently been declared for England, Scotland and now Wales. These restrictions aim to reduce the risk of farmed birds getting infected. Anyone keeping birds in England, Scotland and Wales will be required to take additional measures to prevent their birds being infected – including keeping birds under cover in regions facing the greatest risk.\nWild birds spread the virus to domestic poultry. Andrew M. Allport/ Shutterstock\nThese prevention zones are an important intervention. But given the current outbreak’s scale in wild birds, these measures will at best only reduce the ongoing risk to farmed birds, rather than eliminating it. \n## What does this outbreak mean for humans?\nDespite the serious problems H5N1 is causing for birds, the risk to humans is still very low. Because each virus is closely adapted to a particular host species, it’s really hard for bird flu to infect a human. \nWhen infections do occur, this is normally only in people who have close contact with birds – and even then it’s an unusual event. The recent case of bird flu in a poultry worker in England is almost certainly an example of this sort of “spillover” infection.\nIt’s good to hear the affected person is currently well and that antiviral drugs – which work against these viruses – have been offered to others who may have been exposed. The control measures announced over the weekend will help reduce the risk of other people who work with poultry getting infected.\nIf you don’t have close contact with either wild or farmed birds, your chances of being infected are very low indeed. Still, if you come across any dead birds (particularly waterfowl), it’s important to avoid handling them. Try to prevent pets from scavenging bird carcasses and avoid feeding pets raw bird meat from non-commercial sources. Sightings of dead or sick birds can be reported to health protection agencies.\nBecause influenza viruses are killed quickly by heat, there should be no risk to the public from eating properly-cooked eggs or poultry. The UK outbreak may also cause temporary difficulties in accessing free-range eggs and an increase in egg prices – things that have already been seen in the US, which is also experiencing a major H5N1 outbreak.\n## Is bird flu a problem anywhere else?\nWhat’s happening in the UK is just one part of an ongoing global H5N1 outbreak. \nIn some regions, strains of the virus have managed to spread beyond wild birds and infect mammals as well. In South America, H5N1 is causing devastating outbreaks in seals and sea lions. In the US, it has managed to adapt to dairy cattle and is being shed in their milk. \nThere have also been reported human infections. In the US, numerous farm workers have caught H5N1 from cattle, so far with relatively mild symptoms. There have also been two cases of severe illness in the US and Canada in people who caught a slightly different strain of H5N1 from birds, one of which sadly led to the patient’s death.\nThese cases underscore the potential risks of H5N1 infections. But because human infections are so rare, how likely each strain of H5N1 is to cause severe disease in humans is still unclear. We also need to be on the lookout for any signs that any H5N1 strain anywhere might gain the ability to spread between humans. This would be an exceptionally unusual event – but to minimise the risk of future influenza pandemics, it’s crucial situations like this are carefully monitored.\nNothing has been reported which suggests human-to-human transmission has occurred anywhere during the current outbreak. In the UK we have good surveillance for detecting any signs of this if it did. If wider spread did occur, the reserves of vaccines and antiviral drugs that we have in the UK would give us opportunities to intervene.\nFor now, bird flu remains a very real problem, but is primarily a problem for birds. By intervening now to protect farmed birds, we hope that we can keep it that way.\n_Ed Hutchinson receives funding from the Wellcome Trust and UKRI, including through the Flu:TrailMap-One Health consortium which is working to respond to the H5N1 outbreak.

            "text": "# Red Sea crisis: supply chain issues set to continue despite Gaza ceasefire\n\nA large container ship passing through the Suez Canal in Egypt. byvalet / Shutterstock\nThe world’s major shipping companies say they won’t be sending vessels back to the Red Sea any time soon despite a pledge by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen not to attack them as long as the ceasefire in Gaza holds.\nFrench shipping and logistics company CMA CGM said in a statement on January 25 that the improved stability was “a positive but fragile sign” for the industry, and that it would continue to prioritise alternative routes.\nSince November 2023, one month after the war in Gaza began, the Houthis have launched missile and drone attacks against roughly 190 commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandab Strait. The group claims to have carried out attacks on vessels connected with Israel, or heading to its ports, in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Though this has not always been the case.\nThese attacks have prompted many shipping companies to stop using the Red Sea – a route that around 12% of global trade usually passes through – and divert around the southern tip of Africa. This route adds more than 7,000 nautical miles on to a typical round-trip voyage. The number of commercial ships using the Suez Canal to pass between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea plummeted from over 26,000 in 2023 to 13,200 in 2024.\nSupply chains have had to deal with higher shipping costs, product delivery delays, and increased carbon emissions as a result of this diversion. The Gaza ceasefire gave some hope that the disruption would finally end. But shipping lines will not hurry back to the region until long-term security is guaranteed. \nSince November 2023, shipping companies have been diverting their vessels around the southern tip of Africa to avoid the Red Sea. Dimitrios Karamitros / Shutterstock\nDuring the early stages of the crisis, moving a container from Shanghai in China to Europe cost approximately 250% more than before the war in Gaza began. This was largely due to increased fuel costs and higher insurance premiums. Freight rates (the price companies pay to transport goods) remained high throughout 2024, despite some fluctuations. \nThe cost of moving a 40-foot container from Shanghai to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, surged from around US$4,400 on average in January to above US$8,000 by August. This had dropped to US$4,900 at the end of the year.\nIt is too early to say whether these costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices – full transmission through the supply chain to consumer prices can take upwards of 12 months. But some estimates suggest global consumer prices could rise by 0.6% on average in 2025 as these increased shipping costs filter through the supply chain.\nDiverting around southern Africa also resulted in delays in the delivery of many goods and components. The proportion of container ships that arrived on schedule dropped from 60% on average worldwide in 2023 to about 50% throughout 2024. This created congestion at ports because ships often arrived at their destination later than planned, resulting in further delivery delays. \nUnreliable transit times are a significant issue for supply chains because they make it difficult for businesses to plan inventory and coordinate production schedules. Indeed, several vehicle manufacturers, including Tesla and Volvo, temporarily suspended manufacturing in early 2024 due to a lack of components. And food supply chains, including those for avocados, tea and coffee, were also affected by delays. \nSince then, many companies have adapted by increasing their safety stock levels and transporting cargo using alternative modes of transport like air and rail. Some European firms have also adopted a strategy called “nearshoring”, where they source products from regions closer to home such as Turkey and Morocco instead of relying on suppliers in Asia. \n## Increased emissions\nThe longer route around southern Africa requires that ships travelling between Europe and Asia use around 33% more fuel on average than they would use by travelling through the Red Sea at the same speed. \nOver the past decade, most shipping companies have employed a “slow steaming” policy to economise on fuel use and minimise their carbon emissions. But diverted ships have been travelling around 5% faster than usual in an attempt to minimise delays. The increased vessel speeds will have caused the associated emissions toll to rise – large container vessels require 2.2% more fuel for every 1% increase in speed.\nMore data is required to determine the precise amount of additional emissions caused by diverting shipping away from the Red Sea. But estimates suggest that approximately 13.6 million tonnes of CO₂ were emitted by ships rerouted from the Red Sea between December 2023 and April 2024 – equivalent to the carbon emissions of nine million cars over the same period. If ships continue to avoid the region, the increased emissions could amount to 41 million extra tonnes of CO₂ per year.\nSome cargo has also shifted from sea transport to air freight, which has a far greater environmental footprint. Shipping a kilogram of product by long-haul air freight generates at least 50 times more CO₂ emissions on average than container shipping.\nCarbon emissions have increased due to the diversion of vessels around southern Africa.

This is due, in part, to safety and security concerns related to the crew, cargo and the ship. \nBut shipping companies also have operational challenges to keep in mind associated with the scheduling of port calls and voyages. Shipping lines will find it difficult to switch back to the longer route around Africa immediately if attacks in the Red Sea resume. \nAnd, at least for now, the situation in the Bab al-Mandab Strait remains unpredictable. In a televised speech on January 20, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned: “We have our finger on the trigger.”\nWith other disruptions continuing to affect global shipping, such as port strikes, low water levels in the Panama Canal and extreme weather events, supply chain issues are likely to continue throughout 2025.\n_Gokcay Balci does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"

            "text": "# If we listen to how Gen Z really feel about democracy they might stop telling us they prefer authoritarianism\n\nNew research from broadcaster Channel 4 reveals a troubling trend towards support for authoritarianism among young people in the UK. The report “Gen Z: Trends, Truth and Trust” found that 52% of the 2,000 13-27 year olds surveyed would agree that “the UK would be better with a strong leader in charge who does not have to bother with Parliament and elections”. \nThis correlates with a 2023 study from pro-democracy organisation Open Society Foundations, which found 42% of young people in its global sample felt military rule was a good way of running a country. Other research has found a disillusionment with democracy among young people. \nThese are trends to be worried about. But Gen Z are not somehow inherently anti-democratic. Understanding why these trends are happening is vital if young people are to participate in democracy.\nAt Cumberland Lodge, an education charity that uses dialogue to address social division and conflict, I’m working with colleagues and young people on a nationwide youth and democracy network to re-think what politics in the UK could look like.\n## Hearing Gen Z\nOur team has conducted 12 discussion groups with 101 young people around the country, looking at what stops them getting involved with democratic practices and institutions. Using this research as a starting point, we are now working with a core group of young people to develop their capacities to engage with, and re-imagine democracy.\nWhat we are learning is that young people’s disengagement is not necessarily a sign of apathy or anti-democratic tendencies. The young people we are working with want to engage with politics, but they feel a vast sense of distrust. They see politicians as prioritising their own and corporate interests over public good, and willing to break promises on issues that affect young people’s lives. \nFeeling unsupported by their political system makes young people feel vulnerable – especially in the face of a multitude of global crises. In their lifetime, the world has lurched from a global financial crisis to a worldwide pandemic and to war in Europe. They have to navigate housing shortages, a lack of mental health support, the climate emergency, artificial intelligence and changing identity and social roles. \nA perception of an “elite” system that is supposed to work for everyone, but excludes or even actively works against the sectors of society most affected by these crises, harms young people’s trust in democracy. \nGen Z deal with an onslaught of information about a rapidly changing world. DimaBerlin/Shutterstock\nBut a shift towards support for authoritarianism is by no means inevitable. The Open Society Foundations study found that 86% of young people surveyed still wanted to live in a democracy. \nIn Channel 4’s research, too, 73% of Gen Z think democracy is a “very” or “fairly good” way of governing the UK. And young people want to learn about democracy and the democratic process. \nOur youth and democracy network shows young people are not apathetic. Many want to get involved. They want a better, fairer world. They see the shortcomings of the current system and imagine something better. \n## Getting young people involved\nTo enable this to happen, political and media literacy is crucial for providing young people with necessary knowledge and confidence. Investment in education on democracy is necessary, as many young people in our network wanted to engage but felt overwhelmed and uncertain about where to start. Liam in Sunderland said:\n> Most people our age aren’t educated on [democracy and politics]. It’s restricted knowledge. We’re given the impression that we can’t do anything about it anyway, so just don’t worry.\nYoung people want representatives who understand and engage with the day-to-day realities of their lives, rather than seeing Gen Z as a photo opportunity, as Chloe from Liverpool argued. \n> They’ll come here and they’ll speak to us, but they’re not coming there to listen; they’re coming here so they can go back to wherever they came from and be like ‘oh I spoke to a young person’.\nMany of the young people in our youth network are calling for reform of the political system in order to facilitate these changes: a new voting system, or an exploration of forms of direct democracy. \nBut importantly, what we have seen in this research over the last year, is that young people can shift how they view power. We think of democracy as more than just systems of governance, but it’s also how we organize, how we communicate with each other, how we mobilise around social issues, and how we build consensus. \nIn this sense democracy is not solely something external and out of reach but something that can emerge when young people come together. \nBy working to improve democratic education and to put a system in place that listens to and engages with young people, politicians can help Gen Z re-imagine a democracy that gives them a future. At that point, they might stop telling researchers that they prefer authoritarianism.\n_Melissa Butcher is a member of the Green Party._"

            "text": "# Trump inviting influencers to White House press briefings is likely to usher in a new era of fake news\n\nJust over a week after Donald Trump was sworn in as 47th president of the United States, his new press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, appeared in the James S. Brady press briefing room to preside over her first media conference. Pulling up a chart that showed Americans’ declining trust in traditional, or what she called “legacy”, media outlets, Leavitt announced that henceforth, “independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators” would be welcome at press briefings.\nLeavitt said that seats formerly reserved for White House officials would be available to these independent journalists, and invited people to apply online for White House press accreditation. It has since been reported that the White House has received more than 7,400 applications.\nIn principle, broadening the range of media outlets allowed into White House press briefings is a good idea. There’s no doubt that the media consumption habits of the American public are changing fast. But the way Trump and his communications team handled press briefings in his first term raises some concerns. \nDuring that first term between 2017 and 2021, Trump and his White House communications team tended to favour reporters from friendly media outfits such as Fox News. Early in his administration, a number of reporters from what were perceived as “hostile” organisations were banned from “the huddle” – the informal gatherings around Trump’s press secretary that followed more formal briefings.\nFringe organisations such as Breitbart News  and the One America News network carried Trump’s message faithfully and got disproportionately favourable access. This week, Breitbart was one of two online media outlets (alongside the widely respected news website Axios) that Leavitt selected to ask the first questions at her debut press briefing. \nIt’s not just their friendly disposition towards Trump but their reach that makes social media influencers appealing to the incoming president. Their primary purpose at the press briefings would be to help generate positive messages and content to feed to Trump’s Maga base – which are then promoted on platforms such as Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter).\nRecent research suggests that X has adjusted its algorithm to boost right-wing content as well as posts by Musk himself. A clear example has been Musk promoting the former Fox News host turned online influencer and Trump campaign surrogate Tucker Carlson’s online show.\n## Undermining public regard for journalism\nBut there may be another, insidious function of inviting these influencers to the White House press briefing room. Their presence beside professional journalists from traditional media outlets is likely to undermine public regard for journalism in general. This could sow even greater mistrust in the US media, which is already at record lows.\nIn recent years, there has been a gradual blurring of lines between traditional and digital media. But while research consistently shows, across a wide cross-section of countries and within those countries, traditional media is still more trusted than new media, this is not to say that all new media outlets should be excluded. Many of these organisations and individuals have a track record of holding power to account. \nBellingcat – a coalition of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists – typically uses open-source information to uncover important stories of public interest. Individual journalists such as Taylor Lorenz, who covers the tech and creator industry, and Ken Klippenstein, who is well known for getting hold of internal government documents, are also good examples of journalists who produce quality reports from outside the traditional mainstream.\nIt should ideally be journalists such as these, with track records for solid and impartial reporting, who are invited into the White House fold – although there’s every chance they would get the same sort of treatment as reporters such as CNN’s Jim Acosta, whom Trump famously branded an “enemy of the people” when refusing to answer a question from him in 2018.\nAcosta, incidentally, has just left CNN after the network moved him to the midnight “graveyard” slot. Shortly after signing off from his final CNN broadcast on January 28, Acosta appeared on his own Substack feed to announce he would go it alone. \nIt seems unlikely, though, that he will be awarded one of the coveted new independent media accreditations, given Trump’s recent attack on him. Celebrating Acosta’s apparent relegation by CNN, Trump took to his TruthSocial media site to call him “one of the worst and most dishonest reporters in journalistic history, a major sleazebag”. \n## Polarised media, divided audiences\nIt’s likely that America’s news media will only become more polarised during this second Trump administration, including an increasingly toxic mix of content creators dominating social media platforms. And now that Mark Zuckerberg has decided to remove Meta’s factchecking mechanism in favour of “community moderation”, research suggests this is likely to incentivise political messages which polarise and provoke rather than inform people.\n* * *\n_**Read more:What Meta’s move to community moderation could mean for misinformation ** _\n* * *\nWe’ve already seen that the incoming president was more than willing to use lawsuits to intimidate journalists. Trump recently won a legal case over ABC when its journalist George Stephanopoulos defamed him by falsely saying he had been found liable for rape. \nThis, combined with Trump’s threat to sue the Des Moines Register and its pollster Ann Selzer over their allegations of election interference, are likely to increase the chilling effect on free speech. Legal threats such as these may serve to discourage close scrutiny of his second administration. \nMeanwhile, the steady rise in prominence of partisan influencers using increasingly dangerous language is only likely to lead to the American public having less faith in the institutions that are critical to a functioning democracy – the press included.\n_Steven Buckley does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._"
