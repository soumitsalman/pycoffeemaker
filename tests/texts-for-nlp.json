    "content": "As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure and applications, platform teams are increasingly feeling the strain. A platform team (or infrastructure/DevOps team) is tasked with providing a reliable foundation, including CI/CD pipelines, cloud environments, tooling and compliance guardrails.\nThe issue is that as the number of developers and services grows, platform engineers can become overloaded with support requests and operational tasks.\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the direct workload on [platform teams is to implement self-service infrastructure for developers](https://thenewstack.io/dont-sacrifice-developer-experience-for-platform-governance/). However, self-service in this space is often misunderstood; it doesn't mean developers are writing infrastructure code themselves.\nInstead, it allows them to request and manage resources within the guardrails set by the platform team, ensuring consistency, security and compliance while reducing bottlenecks.\n## Growing Burdens on Platform Teams\nIn a modern tech organization, platform teams wear many hats. They might be responsible for infrastructure provisioning (creating AWS/GCP resources for teams), maintaining CI/CD pipelines, managing shared services like databases and monitoring, enforcing security policies and generally acting as a center of cloud expertise. These responsibilities tend to grow out of control faster than the team can scale to handle them.\nSeveral issues increase the burden on infrastructure teams:\n  * **Cloud complexity** : Each new project adds more services, requiring platform teams to manage provisioning and templates at scale.\n  * **Ticket Ops** : [Developers rely on platform teams for every infrastructure request](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-toll-of-infrastructure-on-developer-productivity/), creating bottlenecks as ticket queues grow.\n  * **Operational toil** : Repetitive tasks like patching, troubleshooting and scaling keep [teams reactive instead of automating](https://thenewstack.io/the-game-changing-impact-of-automation-on-team-dynamics/).\n  * **Context switching** : Supporting multiple teams forces engineers to jump between tasks, reducing efficiency and increasing cognitive load.\n\n\nIf platform teams struggle to keep up, developers experience delays, infrastructure becomes harder to manage and the entire organization slows down. In many organizations, the burden is so great that our platform teams do not have the bandwidth to investigate streamlining options.\n## The Case for Self-Service Infrastructure\nOne approach to reduce the burden on infrastructure engineers is to enable self-service. This allows developers to request and consume infrastructure resources such as databases, queues and APIs on demand, without needing to open tickets or wait for manual provisioning.\nBy enabling self-service infrastructure, platform teams scale their contributions from project-specific implementations, to building reusable automation, guardrails, policies and infrastructure for many teams. Instead of manually provisioning every resource, they create policies and tooling that allow teams to move faster without bypassing security and compliance requirements.\n## Enabling Self-Service Without Loss of Control\nPlatform teams can introduce self-service infrastructure while ensuring security, compliance and governance by implementing key strategies like:\n  * **Reusable templates and catalogs** : Standardized infrastructure patterns, such as pre-configured CI/CD pipelines and service stacks, allow developers to spin up resources without manual intervention.\n  * **Infrastructure as Code with guardrails** : Developers define what they need using tools like Terraform or Pulumi, but platform teams enforce compliance by providing approved modules and policies.\n  * **Role-based access and policy enforcement** : Self-service does not mean unlimited access. Platform teams set permissions, budget constraints and Policy as Code rules (such as Open Policy Agent) to ensure safe, controlled resource provisioning.\n  * **Internal developer platforms (IDPs)** : Unified UIs, command line interface (CLI) and other tooling that abstracts infrastructure complexity, integrating repo creation, CI/CD setup and monitoring into a developer-friendly workflow.\n\n\nThe challenge is ensuring that self-service doesn't lead to configuration drift, security gaps or inconsistent infrastructure deployments. Nitric helps solve this by acting as an interface between development teams and infrastructure, allowing developers to declare what they need while ensuring platform teams retain control over how resources are provisioned and governed.\n### Example: Provisioning Secure and Consistent Infrastructure\nHere is a possible scenario, where an application team or developer has requested cloud storage use in their application. Traditionally, when a team needs a new storage bucket, the process might look something like this:\n  1. The developer submits a ticket requesting an S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.\n  2. A [DevOps engineer manually provisions the bucket or writes Terraform](https://thenewstack.io/your-platform-engineering-toolkit-for-terraform-and-beyond/) to automatically provision it, including required configuration and permissions.\n  3. The engineer hands over the bucket or it is made available via CI/CD, allowing the development team to start using it.\n  4. This process, due its reactive (request/prioritize/response) nature, typically takes hours or days, often blocking the development team in the meantime.\n\n\nWith self-service infrastructure, this workflow changes. Developers request what they need in code or via a platform, and the automation handles provisioning according to pre-approved policies.\nUsing a tool like Nitric, developers can define infrastructure requirements without writing low-level Terraform or dealing with cloud provider APIs.  \n\n```\nimport { bucket } from '@nitric/sdk';\n\n// Developer declares a new bucket for storing user uploads\nconst userFiles = bucket('user-uploads').allow('read', 'write', 'delete');\n\n// Later in their application code:\nasync function saveUserFile(fileName: string, data: Buffer) {\n  await userFiles.file(fileName).write(data);\n  console.log(`Saved file ${fileName} to user-uploads bucket.`);\n}\n```\n\n  \nWhen this code runs, Nitric automatically provisions the required storage bucket in AWS or GCP within the constraints defined by platform engineers.\n### Keeping Guardrails in Place\nWhile developers can request resources, platform teams ensure compliance by enforcing policies at the infrastructure level. For example, all S3 buckets can be automatically encrypted with a platform-wide Terraform policy:  \n\n```\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration\" \"bucket_encryption\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket.id\n\n  rule {\n    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {\n      sse_algorithm = \"AES256\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  \nThis approach ensures:\n  * Developers get what they need without waiting.\n  * Platform teams maintain full control over security and compliance. \n    * Fix once, roll out fixes to all projects\n  * No one has to manually create resources or review tickets.\n  * Infrastructure is consistently deployed across projects\n  * Each project is always in sync with its required infrastructure\n\n\n## Conclusion\nPlatform teams are the backbone of any technology organization, but reactive processes don't scale, particularly when manual work is involved. As teams grow, the demand for infrastructure resources increases, and platform engineers can't afford to spend all their time handling requests, troubleshooting deployment issues, and managing tickets.\n> \"Developer self-service can sound like a dream: A platform that developers can use to freely develop -- unburdened by sprawling IT, tools they shouldn't need to know how to use, and tickets that take forever to complete.\"\n> -- ​**[Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/blog/devops-self-service)**\nSelf-service infrastructure reduces friction, improves security and ensures platform teams stay in control. By shifting from manual provisioning to automation, policy enforcement and developer-friendly self-service tools, platform teams:\n  * Eliminate bottlenecks without compromising security.\n  * Reduce ticket queues and operational toil.\n  * Free up time to focus on automation and platform improvements.\n\n\nInstead of being gatekeepers, platform teams become enablers, helping teams move faster while ensuring infrastructure remains secure and scalable. This is how organizations scale without burning out their platform teams.\nThe post [Streamlining Your Platform Team’s Workloads](https://thenewstack.io/streamlining-your-platform-teams-workloads/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "The AI revolution is here. For many companies, that means leveraging their ordinary hyperscaler to access powerful GPU resources. These resources can enable game-changing product advancements but come at a significant cost. Ensuring you get the performance you're paying for requires careful due diligence to get beyond cloud provider marketing hype.\nNumerous factors impact the efficiency (and ultimately ROI) of an AI deployment: networking, storage, and cooling, just to name a few. This article will arm you with the knowledge to thoroughly evaluate AI cloud providers to help you maximize your return on this significant investment.\n## **Where Cloud Providers Can Fall Short**\nIt's easy to get caught up in the specs of the GPUs themselves: NVIDIA's[ H200](https://www.corvex.ai/product-h200),[ B200](https://www.corvex.ai/product-b200), and[ GB200 NVL72](https://www.corvex.ai/product-gb200) are the current performance leaders, but processing power is only part of the equation. The surrounding operational capacity is just as critical, as it can significantly impact the efficiency of your deployments. Below are questions followed by testing protocols to help you go beyond marketing claims when evaluating your AI cloud alternatives.\n## **Network Bottlenecks Are Silent Performance Killers**\nAI workloads, especially training large models, demand ultra-fast networking. A seemingly impressive GPU can sit idle waiting for data if the network is oversubscribed or has unstable links.\nOversubscription means the provider has allocated more network bandwidth than is physically available. During peak times, your job will compete with other jobs on an oversubscribed network, leading to dramatically reduced performance. While this benefits the service provider by reducing the cost to build and operate the network, it can materially affect your run time and, ultimately, your ROI.\nTo avoid this issue, ensure your provider allocates consistent, unblocked bandwidth to each of your nodes. When evaluating a cloud provider, there are two specific questions you need to ask:\n  1. What is your East-West network oversubscription ratio?\n  2. Do you offer guaranteed non-blocked East-West networking?\n\n\nIt's important not to settle for a generic answer. Ask for specific metrics and performance guarantees. Even more important: Don't just ask. _Test it_ (more on that later).\n## **Slow Storage Cripples Training Runs and Model Loading**\nA powerful GPU is only as effective as the storage system that feeds it data. If storage can't keep up, even the fastest GPUs will sit idle while waiting for data to be loaded. Insufficient storage bandwidth not only slows down training and inference workloads but can also cause checkpointing latency and failures, risking the loss of valuable progress.\nCloud providers often advertise peak storage speeds, but real-world performance under load can be significantly lower. Factors such as network congestion, contention for shared storage resources, and latency spikes can degrade sustained throughput, impacting overall speed.\nWe suggest asking any prospective service provider the following:\n  1. What is the sustained storage throughput under real-world workloads for my GPU instances?\n  2. Can you provide detailed performance metrics, or allow me to conduct benchmarking tests to validate actual throughput?\n\n\n## **Cooling, Throttling and Hidden Performance Degradation**\nCooling is crucial and often overlooked. If GPUs overheat, they throttle their performance to prevent damage. This throttling can significantly reduce your performance _without you even knowing it_. The problem is that providers rarely highlight their cooling infrastructure. You might be paying for peak GPU performance, but secretly only getting half the speed due to overheating.\nBefore signing a contract, ask your cloud provider what cooling they employ to ensure consistent GPU performance, how they monitor and proactively address any cooling-related throttling issues, and what transparency they will provide should issues arise.\n## **Are You Getting a Full GPU?**\nGPU pricing models can be misleading**.** Many cloud providers advertise GPU instances without clearly stating whether you're getting exclusive access to the hardware or a shared, virtualized portion. This distinction significantly impacts both performance and cost efficiency.\nThe hidden risk is in resource slicing and oversubscription**.** Some providers quietly partition GPUs, allocating fractions of their compute power to multiple users. Others oversubscribe their infrastructure, meaning more workloads compete for limited resources than the system can fully support. While instances may appear \"available,\" actual performance can fluctuate due to contention and noisy neighbors, leading to slower training times, degraded inference speed, and inefficient resource utilization.\nThat has cost implications. Paying for a GPU instance that doesn't deliver full performance means you're effectively overpaying for what you receive. If a provider is overscheduling or slicing GPUs without transparency, your cost per unit of actual compute power is higher than expected.\nMake sure to ask your service provider:\n  1. Am I getting a fully dedicated GPU, or is it shared?\n  2. If shared, what portion of resources are allocated to my instance, and how is performance guaranteed?\n  3. Can you provide benchmarking data on sustained performance under load?\n\n\n## **Redundancy and Reliability**\nPower failures, whether a full data center outage or a single power supply failure, can bring AI workloads to a standstill. Given the high computational demands of AI training and inference, even brief interruptions can corrupt training runs, delay project timelines, and lead to significant financial losses.\nRedundant power infrastructure is essential to ensuring reliability. Without proper redundancy, a single point of failure in the power system -- such as a faulty UPS, generator failure, or grid disruption -- can cause unexpected downtime, impacting productivity and increasing operational costs.\nNot all redundancy architectures are equal. Some cloud providers implement N+1 redundancy, where there is a single backup component for critical power infrastructure, while others use 2N redundancy, offering fully duplicated systems for maximum reliability. Understanding your provider's redundancy level helps assess potential risks to your workload's continuity.\nThere are three key questions to ask your provider about power redundancy:\n  1. What is your power redundancy architecture (N+1, 2N, or higher)?\n  2. How do you handle power failures at both the infrastructure and rack levels?  Provide me with data floor power outage data for the past 24 months.\n  3. Do you have 24/7 on-site support with skilled personnel and spare parts readily available to minimize downtime?\n\n\n## **Watch Out for Data Transfer Fees**\nEgress fees, the charges for moving data out of the cloud, can quickly become a significant, and often unexpected, budget killer.\nSome providers charge exorbitant fees to move your datasets in and out, effectively locking you into their platform. Before you deploy, make sure that any and all egress fees are clearly stated and agreed upon. Also, ask about your provider's willingness to give volume discounts or offer alternative pricing models.\n## **Software Stack Sufficiency: Drivers, Storage, and Kernels Matter**\nAI isn't just about hardware; it's also about the software stack. Outdated NVIDIA drivers, slow storage stacks, or unoptimized kernels can severely impact performance.\nA shiny new GPU is only as good as the software that drives it. If the provider isn't actively tuning their infrastructure and keeping their software up to date, you're leaving performance on the table.\nTo ensure maximum efficiency, choose a provider who proactively maintains their infrastructure. Ask them:\n  1. How frequently do you update your NVIDIA drivers and other software components?\n  2. Are you actively tuning your infrastructure to optimize performance for AI workloads?\n  3. Can you provide information about your storage stack?\n\n\n## **Verifying Performance**\nAsking the right questions is essential, but it's only the first step. You need to _test_ everything.\n  1. **GPU performance:** Run benchmarks specific to your workload. Don't rely solely on synthetic benchmarks.\n  2. **Storage throughput:** Measure sustained read and write speeds under realistic load conditions.\n  3. **Network throughput:** Test network bandwidth between your instances and your local environment.\n\n\nRemember that testing provides a snapshot in time. Ongoing monitoring and analysis are necessary to ensure consistent performance.\n## **Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Holding Providers Accountable**\nService Level Agreements (SLAs) are essential for ensuring reliability, setting clear performance expectations, and holding cloud providers accountable. In AI workloads, where prolonged downtime can mean lost productivity and increased costs, a well-defined SLA helps mitigate risk by guaranteeing response times, uptime commitments, and failure recovery procedures.\nNot all SLAs are created equal. Some providers offer vague or non-binding guarantees, while others include strict penalties for failing to meet performance commitments. A strong SLA should specify availability guarantees, compensation for downtime, and proactive failure mitigation strategies.\nGPU failures can be particularly disruptive. Since AI workloads often require continuous high-performance computing, a failed GPU can delay model training or inference tasks without rapid replacement. The ability to quickly replace or repair hardware depends on whether the provider maintains on-site spare parts, rapid access to replacement components, and skilled support teams.\nHere are some questions to ask to ensure your SLA will adequately protect your deployment:\n  1. Describe your proactive maintenance and monitoring capabilities\n  2. What is your uptime SLA and penalties for violations?\n  3. Describe your on-site sparing and approach to replacing major hardware failures.\n  4. Do you offer support SLAs? How skilled is your support staff?\n\n\n## **Demand Transparency and Verify Performance**\nInvesting in AI infrastructure is a significant decision and a very significant monetary investment. Choosing the wrong AI cloud service provider can prove costly and incredibly inefficient. Don't rely solely on marketing materials. Ask the tough questions, demand transparency, and meticulously test performance. By taking a proactive approach, you can ensure that your cloud provider delivers the performance you're paying for and unlocks the true potential of your AI initiatives.\nThe post [A Guide To Navigating GPU Rentals and AI Cloud Performance](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-navigating-gpu-rentals-and-ai-cloud-performance/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "[Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) this week rolled out an updated [Gemini 2.5 Pro model](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-updates/) with what it describes as \"significantly enhanced coding capabilities\" for developers. The search and [web services](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-services/) giant enabled [early access to ](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/)[Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O Edition)](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/) ahead of its planned debut May 20 at Google I/O.\nBased on feedback obtained from developers during testing, this new model ostensibly has a deeper understanding of code paired with high-end reasoning capabilities. Google claims this combination provides a path to more [intuitive development workflows](https://thenewstack.io/prepare-developers-for-integrating-ai-into-their-workflows/), simplifying the building process.\nThe advancements in Gemini 2.5 Pro's architecture and training have led to a more sophisticated ability to understand, reason about, and generate code, Google said, making it a more capable and reliable [AI for software development](https://thenewstack.io/from-automation-to-optimization-ais-expanding-role-in-software-development/) tasks. This was recorded in both benchmark results and anecdotal evidence from developers, the company said.\nThis model excels at [front-end and UI development](https://thenewstack.io/frontend-development/), and this isn't an incremental tweak, Google said. The updated model now leads the [WebDevArena leaderboard](https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard), demonstrating superior capability in coding. It also continues to build on its foundation in native multimodality and long context; it has state-of-the-art performance in video understanding, with a score of 84.8% on the [VideoMME benchmark](https://github.com/MME-Benchmarks/Video-MME).\n## Why the AI Reasoning Is So Improved\nThe main improvement in this new version is that Google engineers have improved [AI reasoning for coding](https://thenewstack.io/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-ai-coding/). This can be attributed to these factors:\n  * Gemini 2.5 Pro is described as a \"thinking model\" with reasoning capabilities built directly into its architecture, rather than being a bolt-on feature. This allows the model to analyze information, draw logical conclusions, incorporate context, and make more informed decisions when generating code. This enhanced reasoning leads to better problem-solving and more accurate code generation.\n  * The new version is reported to generalize better to problems it hasn't encountered previously. This suggests an improved ability to apply its understanding of coding principles to novel situations, leading to more adaptable code.\n\n\nWith a 1 million token context window (and plans for 2 million), Gemini 2.5 Pro can process and reason over much larger codebases and more extensive contextual information. This allows it to maintain a better understanding of the overall project and generate more coherent and contextually appropriate code, especially in complex projects with numerous files and dependencies.\nThe model exhibits a deeper understanding of code, enabling it to make better judgment calls and choose appropriate abstractions, similar to a more senior developer. This improved comprehension of the nuances of code allows for more sophisticated and contextually relevant code suggestions and generation.\nGemini 2.5 Pro's ability to understand and process information across different modalities (text, audio, images, video) can contribute to better coding reasoning in specific scenarios, such as generating code from a video demonstration or understanding UI design from visual inputs.\nAnother specific improvement testers mentioned is a significant reduction in errors related to function calling and improved trigger rates. This indicates a better understanding of how to interact with external tools and [APIs](https://thenewstack.io/api-management/), leading to more reliable and functional code integration.\nThe model utilizes an internal \"thinking process\" during response generation, which involves multistep planning to tackle complex tasks. By breaking down problems and reasoning through potential solutions, one can arrive at more effective and accurate coding outputs.\nThis is available today, Google said. The improved model will seamlessly replace the current Gemini 2.5 Pro in the [Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/welcome) across [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) and the [Gemini App](https://gemini.google/about/?hl=en), making these advanced coding capabilities immediately available to developers.\nThe post [Gemini 2.5 Pro: Google's Coding Genius Gets an Upgrade](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-2-5-pro-googles-coding-genius-gets-an-upgrade/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "In recent months, remarkable advances have been made in general-purpose browser agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Industry leaders, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, have released these agents, Operator and Computer Use, respectively, for the public to use. These browser tools have demonstrated impressive capabilities, from booking restaurant reservations to answering diverse and complex questions.\nGeneral-purpose browser agents, despite their flexibility, fail to perform structured, repeatable business tasks. Precise analytics, automated workflows, and reliable [data](https://thenewstack.io/automating-context-in-structured-data-for-llms/) enrichment depend critically on consistently structured data. Without a predictable structure, extracted data rapidly becomes unreliable, severely limiting its practical value for downstream processes essential to business and technical applications.\n## Why General Agents Struggle With Scale\nSeveral [key issues are limiting the effectiveness of general-purpose AI agents](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-key-concepts-and-how-they-overcome-llm-limitations/), like OpenAI's Operator and Claude's Computer Use, when applied to large-scale data extraction tasks:\n  * **Lack of Structure:** Agents typically produce outputs that aren't consistently structured. Since most have been built with question-answering as their primary focus, their outputs tend to be paragraph-formatted or loosely organized.\n  * **Limited Website Coverage:** Existing benchmarks to evaluate these agents typically include only a narrow set of websites, often simulated or tightly controlled environments. As a result, general-purpose agents struggle to adapt to the complexity, variability, and messiness of real-world websites.\n  * **Model Laziness:** Open AI Operator or Claude Computer Use frequently stops execution prematurely after extracting only partial data (such as a single page of listings). For example, for specific tasks with several pages of data, these models would save partial information on the first page and terminate execution.\n\n\n## Key Insight: All Problems Have Structure\nAt [Bardeen](https://www.bardeen.ai/), our approach to web agents is fundamentally different. Rather than competing head-to-head with large model providers by building increasingly bigger and more computationally expensive models, we chose to leverage the inherent structure of real-world web tasks. Through building millions of automations for team and enterprise customers, we've learned that many critical business tasks -- like extracting job postings, monitoring company blog updates, or analyzing customer testimonials -- rely heavily on structured data.\nMoreover, we've observed that websites presenting this data consistently use repetitive HTML structures.\nBy recognizing and exploiting this underlying structure, both in the business problems themselves and the websites presenting the data, we realized we could build a significantly more efficient, accurate, and scalable AI Agent without resorting to brute computational force.\n## BardeenAgent: A New Approach To Building Browser Agents\nOur solution, BardeenAgent, implements this structured approach through a two-step execution process:\n  1. **Capture the Extraction Structure (Once)**\n\n\nFirst, BardeenAgent navigates to the desired data on a webpage and uses an LLM to identify and record how to extract a single data item. This step generates robust CSS selectors and a structured extraction script, essentially creating a reusable \"recipe\" for capturing similar data.\n  2. **Replay with Precision (Many Times)**\n\n\nInstead of repeatedly invoking an expensive AI inference for every subsequent data item, BardeenAgent replays this recorded extraction script [across multiple pages or data](https://thenewstack.io/stream-data-across-multiple-regions-and-clouds-with-kafka/) points. This approach drastically reduces computational overhead and improves reliability.\n## **Why It Works: Efficiency Through Reusability**\nThis structured approach is powerful because it ensures the following:\n  * **Consistency** : Structured scripts reliably extract data, ensuring consistent output formats.\n  * **Scalability** : Once the structure is captured, extraction [scales quickly and efficiently to hundreds or thousands of data](https://thenewstack.io/five-strategies-for-securing-and-scaling-streaming-data-in-the-ai-era/) points.\n  * **Cost and Time Efficiency** : Fewer AI calls mean dramatically lower costs and faster data extraction.\n\n\n## Real-World Applications and Results: Introducing WebLists\nTo evaluate BardeenAgent's effectiveness in extracting structured data, we evaluated how well [LLM browser agents performed on our new benchmark](https://thenewstack.io/benchmark-llm-application-performance-with-langchain/), WebLists, composed of use cases requested by real enterprise customers. This includes scenarios like:\n  * Tracking **job postings** to identify competitors' growth or hiring trends\n  * Monitoring **company blogs** and product updates to prepare informed sales outreach.\n  * Extracting **customer testimonial** s for robust competitive analysis.\n\n\nWhen evaluating the BardeenAgent against other methods on the WebLists benchmark, the results were clear: Our evaluation demonstrated that BardeenAgent's structured approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art agents, including [Wilbur](https://www.bardeen.ai/posts/wilbur-adaptive-in-context-learning-for-robust-and-accurate-web-agents) (Bardeen's previously published agent), [Agent-E](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/agent-e-sota), and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/). BardeenAgent achieved a 66.2% recall, more than **doubling the best method 's performance**. On top of that, the structured method also translated directly into cost efficiency: BardeenAgent **achieves roughly 3x lower cost per extracted row** compared to competing solutions.\n## A Different Approach\nGeneral AI is impressive, but when the structure and accuracy of the results matter for your business, you need a different approach. BardeenAgent addresses this gap by leveraging the inherent structure of web data, enabling businesses and researchers alike to extract valuable insights efficiently and reliably at scale.\nRead our full technical paper and blog post here if you want to move beyond general AI limitations and tap into structured web intelligence.\nIf you're Interested in testing how your own agent compares or exploring this approach further, reach out to us at ml@bardeen.ai. We're excited to collaborate with and support the broader AI community.\n* * *\n_The owner of TNS, Insight Partners, also invests in Bardeen. As a result, Bardeen receives preference as a contributor._\nThe post [David vs. Goliath: Use Tactics Over Size When Building AI Agents](https://thenewstack.io/david-vs-goliath-use-tactics-over-size-when-building-ai-agents/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "Claude, Supermaven and Cursor users are much more likely to say they had a positive experience than users of other AI-based developer tools. Users of Google Gemini, JetBrains AI and Meta's Llama are much less likely to report having a positive experience with those technologies.\nThese are just some of the many findings we uncovered in [\"The 2025 State of Web Dev AI\"](https://2025.stateofai.dev/) report. The study also indicates that hallucinations, inaccuracies, lack of context and generally poor code quality are particularly challenging when using AI coding assistants and other AI-focused developer tools.\nThe report is based on more than 4,000 responses collected in February and March. Respondents were mostly web developers who had previously taken a survey about [JavaScript](https://thenewstack.io/javascript/), [React](https://thenewstack.io/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-react-today/) and other topics conducted by [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com) and the [Devographics](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US) team. In addition to insights about AI adoption and challenges, these are some of the most relevant findings:\n  * **AI is an integral part of developers ' workflow.** Fifty-nine percent agreed with that statement, compared to 26% who disagreed.\n  * **AI tools increase productivity.** Fifty-nine percent agreed with that statement, compared to 20% who disagreed.\n  * **AI tools are regularly used.** Sixty-nine percent use AI tools to generate or refactor code at least a few times a week.\n  * **[Vibe coding](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-and-you/) is still in its infancy.** Sixty-nine percent of respondents said that less than 25% of the code they produce is AI-generated. When asked about what type of code they generate with AI, 80% cited helper functions, 57% frontend components, 51% [creating documentation](https://thenewstack.io/code-in-context-how-ai-can-help-improve-our-documentation/) and comments and 50% cited tests.\n  * **AI-generated code requires refactoring.** Seventy-six percent of developers have to rewrite or refactor at least half of the outputted code before it's ready to be used. Poor readability, variable renaming, excessive repetition and code that doesn't work were reasons cited about why refactoring is necessary.\n\n\n## Models, Coding Assistants and IDEs\nIn the survey's questions, each specific [AI technology](https://thenewstack.io/ai/) or tool was only included in one category, even though there is overlap in functionality. Unsurprisingly, 91% of respondents have used ChatGPT, with [GitHub Copilot](https://thenewstack.io/a-developer-health-check-on-github-copilot-and-ai-assistants/) (71%), [Claude](https://thenewstack.io/claude-code-and-the-art-of-test-driven-development/) (57%) and [Google Gemini](https://thenewstack.io/qa-how-google-itself-uses-its-gemini-large-language-model/) (55%) also seeing strong adoption.\nClaude users are more likely to be satisfied than users of the other major players, with 65% feeling positive about the offering. Note that the positive/negative sentiment question was not required; if it were, that statistic would be even more impressive.\nIn comparison, only 37% of Google Gemini users are positive about the technology and 39% are positive about [Llama](https://thenewstack.io/llama-stack-released-to-help-developers-build-agentic-apps/). Since Gemini has seen several significant advances over the last year, perhaps sentiment will improve over the next 12 months.\nAfter GitHub Copilot, [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) (17%), [JetBrains AI](https://thenewstack.io/jetbrains-agentic-ai-assistant-helps-automate-coding-tasks/) (13%), [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/about) (10%) and [Qodo](https://thenewstack.io/qodo-a-multi-agent-code-platform-to-write-test-and-review-code/) (8%) are the most used coding assistants. Among these, Supermaven rates the best, with 66% of its users feeling positively included about it. JetBrains AI ranks the lowest, with 28% having a particularly favorable impression.\nFor [AI-enabled integrated development environments (IDEs)](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ides-next-frontier-in-intelligent-coding/) and editors, [Cursor](https://thenewstack.io/using-cursor-ai-as-part-of-your-development-workflow/) is both the most used (33%) and most likely to have users volunteer that they feel positive about the product (55%). [Zed](https://thenewstack.io/an-introduction-to-zed-ai-and-how-it-compares-to-cursor-ai/) is used by about half as many developers (17%), but only 36% of its users were positive about it.\nVercel's [v0](https://v0.dev/) and [Bolt](https://thenewstack.io/how-developers-are-using-bolt-a-fast-growing-ai-coding-tool/) are two other offerings that help with pair programming, used by 27% and 13%, respectively.\n## What Are the Pain Points?\nParticipants in the survey were asked a series of open-ended questions about the pain points associated with using different types of AI for development. Different types of issues were identified using keywords via both automation and manual data processing. Hallucinations and inaccuracies were the most common challenges mentioned when using AI models and coding assistants. Here are two relevant quotes:\n  * \"Hallucination -- even the best models require a bit of 'babysitting,' as they can be supremely confident they're right.\"\n  * \"I used Copilot+ when it was still paid, I didn't continue my free trial. Copilot was constantly forcing its way into my flow, with 95% of the time being wrong suggestions.\"\n\n\nChallenges associated with context and memory limitations were mentioned most often by survey participants using AI-focused IDEs or editors. The issue ranked No. 2 for both models and coding assistants. Complaints were also lodged about intrusive suggestions when using both coding assistants and IDEs.\nHere are a few relevant quotes:\n  * \"Context adjustment. After the first or second prompt, every AI model has been very hard to adjust as you refine or set more correctional parameters. It starts being more and more wrong on every answer, evolving the whole discussion to pure noise that at some point you just can't fix anymore.\"\n  * \"No deep integration into classic refactoring features. Renaming a file should cause checking all import statements. Same for moving files. Yet coding agents are not even aware of such context updates if I do that manually.\"\n  * 'The way that these assistants 'help' you with tasks is often far too aggressive, and as someone with a learning disability, I find their constant insertion of different approaches and ideas as I'm working to be incredibly distracting.\"\n  * \"Context loss is the biggest issue. It rarely happens in Cursor now, but when it does it's super annoying. ChatGPT in the browser will just lose entire chunks of conversations, often in the middle of an existing conversation. Warp terminal is the worst for this, one accidental backspace or Ctrl-C and you've lost 30 minutes of back-and-forth context.\"\n\n\nPoor quality is the most common challenge when using these tools to generate code. For example, one respondent wrote:\n  * \"All AI code generation I've tried generates a big pile of unmaintainable and non-testable code that might work in the moment it is given for the specific interpretation that the AI had at that moment. I've never seen AI code that was even remotely close to something that could be shipped to production.\"\n\n\nThe post [AI-Generated Code Needs Refactoring, Say 76% of Developers](https://thenewstack.io/ai-generated-code-needs-refactoring-say-76-of-developers/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "At its [.NEXT 2025 conference](https://www.nutanix.com/next) this week in Washington, D.C., [Nutanix](https://nutanix.com) introduced a set of new products and services that carry its \"Run Anything Anywhere\" corporate banner into some new use cases. Involving next-gen infrastructure, containerized applications, and AI-powered enterprise workflows, these additions to the Nutanix catalog demonstrate the company's move from a mere hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) provider to a broader platform enabler for distributed, [scalable IT operations.](https://thenewstack.io/operations/)\n## **Expanding Modern Infrastructure**\nNutanix is formally extending support for external storage systems -- marking an evolution from its traditional all-in-one HCI stack. Following a major early-access partnership with [Dell PowerFlex](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/powerflex/sf/powerflex) last year, Nutanix is now generalizing support and adding a new enterprise alliance with [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/).\nThis integration, [Nutanix SVP Lee Caswell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecaswell/) told The New Stack, allows customers with large-scale storage estates to retain their preferred storage architecture -- whether Dell's PowerFlex or [Pure's NVMe-over-TCP arrays ](https://blog.purestorage.com/purely-technical/flasharray-extends-nvme-of-support-to-tcp/)-- while managing workloads through Nutanix's Prism interface. It's a model that appeals directly to organizations with dedicated storage teams and performance-intensive applications, offering high-scale support (up to 128 nodes) while simplifying snapshotting, replication, and VM-level restores, Caswell said.\nThese partnerships also help Nutanix position itself as a compelling alternative for enterprises looking to reduce dependency on VMware technologies following Broadcom's acquisition -- enabling customers to replace vSphere, SRM, and NSX with Nutanix's integrated compute, DR, and networking services.\n## **Cloud Native AOS**\nAnother major reveal at the conference is the debut of [Cloud Native AOS](https://www.nutanix.com/press-releases/2025/nutanix-announces-cloud-native-aos), the first product release from the long-gestating Project Beacon. This containerized version of Nutanix's AOS storage stack enables deployment across Kubernetes environments without the need for a hypervisor. It reflects Nutanix's commitment to supporting modern applications wherever they run -- across data centers, public clouds, and edge environments.\n\"Cloud Native AOS builds on Nutanix's hypervisor-agnostic architecture, offering enterprise-grade data services (such as snapshots, replication, disaster recovery) within containerized environments like Amazon EKS and Google Cloud,\" Caswell said. \"Our partnership with Canonical also enables deployment on bare-metal Linux at the edge, reducing infrastructure overhead while preserving full enterprise support and observability.\"\nThis modular architecture not only supports modern [DevOps workflows](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) but also gives infrastructure teams the ability to manage containerized environments with the same data resilience, compliance, and recovery capabilities they expect from virtualized stacks, Caswell said.\n## **AI Enablement With NVIDIA**\nNutanix is also doubling down on artificial intelligence by announcing an extended partnership with NVIDIA that integrates advanced AI agent models into the enterprise IT workflow. The collaboration introduces capabilities for deploying production-grade large language models (LLMs) with enhanced privacy and control -- using NVIDIA's NeMo framework for guardrails, re-ranking, and embedding.\n\"This addresses key enterprise concerns around data security, model tuning, and performance optimization,\" Caswell said. \"By embedding NVIDIA's AI model components directly into Nutanix's platform, customers can orchestrate AI workflows that are optimized for GPU infrastructure, resilient across edge and cloud locations, and compliant with organizational policies.\"\nFor many enterprises still navigating the complexities of AI adoption, Nutanix offers a clear starting point: curated model deployment, data protection, and operational guardrails -- all managed through a unified, infrastructure-agnostic platform, Caswell said.\n## **De-risking VMware**\nNutanix is focusing on customer choice and architectural flexibility with its new offerings. This includes a comprehensive set of updates designed to help customers \"de-risk\" their exposure to[ Broadcom's VMware business](https://thenewstack.io/vmware-users-adjust-to-broadcom-subscription-licensing/) by offering alternatives for virtualization, recovery, and networking, Caswell -- himself a former VMware exec -- told reporters at a press briefing.\nThe San Jose-based company's expansion into external storage, containerized platforms, and AI orchestration is further supported by joint go-to-market efforts with Dell, Pure, Cisco, and Canonical -- alongside support for major cloud environments including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.\n\"Customers want the freedom to run any application, anywhere -- whether that's traditional VMs, containerized workloads, or advanced AI models. We're enabling that vision by making infrastructure invisible, intelligent, and adaptable,\" Caswell said.\nAs IT operations grow increasingly decentralized -- from hybrid clouds to remote edge deployments -- Nutanix is positioning itself as the orchestration and data management layer that can unify the experience. By embracing external storage, Kubernetes-native architectures, and AI workflows, the company is moving well beyond its HCI roots.\nThe .NEXT 2025 announcements signal a maturing platform that caters not only to IT operators seeking simplification but also to developers, AI engineers, and data scientists seeking performance and portability. As one analyst attending the briefing noted, \"This is not just HCI anymore -- it's the connective tissue for the modern enterprise.\"\nThe post [Nutanix Unveils Major Platform Expansions at .NEXT 2025](https://thenewstack.io/nutanix-unveils-major-platform-expansions-at-next-2025/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "MIAMI -- [Edwin Gnichtel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ned-gnichtel-12039965/) has seen some big balls of mud in his time -- and by balls of mud, he means legacy applications and IT systems.\nGnichtel is the CEO of [CodeLogic](https://codelogic.com/), a software intelligence automation platform that's deploying AI to resolve technical debt. Previously, he was CodeLogic's chief technology officer and has also worked in [low-level software engineering](https://www.technologyandstrategy.com/news/what-is-a-low-level-software-engineer).\nIt's so bad, it's difficult to graph, he told the audience at Tuesday's [Infobip Shift Miami](https://shift.infobip.com/us/#hero), a developer conference focused on AI.\n\"Why do we have 75,000 classes?\" He asked. \"That's a real number out of a real system. It was just one system, by the way, that was part of much larger ecosystem of systems.\"\n## Development Causes of Technical Debt\nThere are many causes of [technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/technical-debt-continues-to-mount-heres-how-to-solve-it/) in development work. He blamed [Agile](https://thenewstack.io/agile-reinvented-a-look-into-the-future/) for adding to debt through its endless push to production, adding that while he's a proponent of Agile, its focus on rapid delivery accelerates technical debt by prioritizing features over code quality.\nAdditionally, he pointed to systems built on outdated frameworks. Plus, nobody really does system architecture any more, he added. He also blamed [misinterpretation of microservices](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-fail-at-microservices/).\n\"How many organizations think that like taking the existing thing that they have and just shutting it into a container suddenly, magically made that a microservice?\" he asked rhetorically.\nHe showed a knowledge graph of a smaller application with a \"mere\" 5000 classes, 34,000 methods, 300 tables, 4700 SQL functions and countless edge connections in the form of class derivation and method-to-method calls.\nA graph of a small application's many dependencies.\n\"When you get to a bigger application, there's no way I can even visually represent it,\" he said. \"[It] would just be a blob of color on the screen.\"\n## AI's Role in Technical Debt\nInto this muddy mess, we're adding AI-generated code.\n\"AI has potential to make this spectacularly worse,\" he said. \"It's written on top of a whole bunch of garbage [which] does not make for a great outcome, ultimately. So we're driving a technical debt.\"\nOrganizations are dealing with endless code maintenance. Put simply, it's no longer a problem humans can solve, he argued.\nBut maybe AI can.\nCodeLogic's approach is to first map the complexity of a system by using an AI agent to create a large knowledge graph.\n\"In many cases, tons of dependencies really only become visible when the code is executed -- things like, for example, procedurally generated connection objects, certain types of constructed database queries, all sorts of things like that,\" he said.\nExecution environments, interpreters and build environments that includes compilers love to inject things, he added. For instance, [Java](https://thenewstack.io/java-modernizes-new-tools-for-ai-and-quantum-age/) uses lambdas. Lambdas don't really exist, he said. When you look at the byte code, it's just converted into classes and methods, he explained.\n\"It's a figment of Java's imagination,\" he said.\nAll these dependencies have to be captured, he added. CodeLogic's data model, which sits underneath the product, offers a differential analysis and provides impact information to help the company understand how everything is connected.\n## Complex Solutions With AI\nCodeLogic's use of multiple models shows how complex systems can be built with AI.\nCodeLogic had always planned to use machine learning and other AI technologies, but what they hadn't anticipated is how quickly the models would improve once they stacked models, deployed an MCP server, and used other techniques for improving [large language models](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-a-large-language-model/).\n\"It allowed us to really fast forward on this problem,\" he said.\n[Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://thenewstack.io/retrieval-augmented-generation-for-llms/) with an MCP server allowed them to \"talk\" to the LLMs, to point to the code that has to be reviewed. An impact analysis reveals all the parts that a rewrite could potentially impact, including pieces that are multiple \"hops\" away, such as REST endpoints, API boundaries and databases.\nThe process is not always straightforward and can involve re-prompting and checks against the CodeLogic system to understand what the AI knows. It should be tracked to ensure it doesn't break dependencies, he said. A human in the loop is also needed to approve the changes.\nCodeLogic creates a multigraph differential analysis that can start generating all the necessary disk sets. That gets interpreted by a model, which then generates a differential set. The differential set is interpreted by yet another model, which generates sets of prompts and tickets.\nThose can be placed into [JIRA](https://thenewstack.io/why-developers-hate-jira-and-what-atlassian-is-doing-about-it/) so that the AI can be held accountable for closing tickets.\n\"At the end of the day, the key piece is it writes the prompts as well,\" he said. \"Those prompts can get pretty sophisticated, and then that gets shoved right back into the augmented AI on the generation side, the code generation side, which then allows you to have all that get done.\"\nThe final piece is helping developers to [stop creating technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/stop-technical-debt-before-it-damages-your-company/). For instance, a developer can ask the CodeLogic system what happens if a particular version of the library is introduced.\n\"We have functionality around our annotation language where, if you make a change, people get notified [and] slaps on the hand occur,\" he said.\nThe post [Killing Tech Debt: CodeLogic's Complex AI Solution](https://thenewstack.io/killing-tech-debt-codelogics-complex-ai-solution/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "With all the [hype around AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai-powered-coding-developer-tool-trends-to-monitor-in-2025/), it can be difficult to know which aspects of AI technology are actually being implemented inside enterprises. To find out, I spoke with [Brian Wald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwald/), who heads up GitLab's Field CTO team and is in regular contact with enterprise IT departments.\nWald described the Field CTO role at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) as one that provides strategic, high-level advisory support to businesses undergoing digital transformations. They tend to focus on DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and (now of course) AI technology. Additionally, his team of nine Field CTOs feeds back industry trends and customer insights to GitLab's product and engineering teams.\nAs for AI specifically, Wald explained that GitLab began investing in AI and machine learning about three years ago -- with an initial focus on leveraging its large codebase to support development processes. But over time, it switched to focusing on the \"post-commit\" stages.\n\"What we see is that post-commit -- you know, once people have made the code change -- there [are] a number of steps that take a super long time for it to get into production. And we're looking at how can we minimize that time span [using AI],\" Wald said.\nThis is where his Field CTO team came in. Based on customer feedback, Wald explained, GitLab shifted its AI efforts toward [automating time-consuming tasks](https://thenewstack.io/gitlabs-field-cto-predicts-when-devsecops-meets-ai/) like code reviews, security audits, and CI pipeline troubleshooting. This approach was particularly useful for teams in regulated, high-compliance environments -- which is one of the areas the company focuses on.\n## From Coding to Architecting\nOne of the trends Wald and his team of Field CTOs have identified in the AI era is a shift in the type of work required of enterprise development teams. As AI becomes more capable of generating code -- especially when given proper structure, prompts and context -- developers are shifting their focus toward higher-level responsibilities, Wald noted. In large organizations, especially in regulated industries like finance, developers are now acting more like architects: spending more time on upfront design, defining business logic, and creating high-context environments to guide AI-generated code.\n\"Your senior engineers or your lead development teams, they're spending more of their time saying, 'Okay, here's how this connects into our subsystems. Here's the business logic that's associated [with] it'. And building out high context windows, so that when the developers go and build these tasks, it's using that context as a way to build better code.\"\nWald added that organizations are also wary of the quality of code being generated by AI assistant software. This means that enterprise developers are increasingly taking on quality assurance and code review roles, ensuring that AI-written code meets organizational standards, uses approved libraries, and maintains security and efficiency.\n> \"…you become kind of the orchestrators of the code, versus the writers of the code.\"  \n>  **- Brian Wald, Global Head, Field CTO at GitLab**\n\"So you become kind of the orchestrators of the code, versus the writers of the code,\" Wald said. \"[On] the front end, you're doing a lot more analysis and building out plans. [On] the back end, you're doing a lot of 'let's review this and make sure this actually makes sense' and [that] we're not creating more technical debt.\"\nI asked whether software developers are taking on these new \"code orchestrator\" tasks, or is it being done by existing IT architects?\nIn some cases, Wald replied, developers are naturally evolving into these roles without formal recognition -- they're just spending less time writing code and more time on architectural or planning tasks. But in more mature organizations, this shift is being formally acknowledged and acted upon. These companies are restructuring their teams, explicitly defining architect roles that work closely with product managers to design systems rather than write code.\n\"So you have, like, a PM and an architect who are sitting together doing a lot of this development,\" he explained, adding that their job is to create a \"blueprint\" for the code generation.\n## Does Vibe Coding Belong in the Enterprise?\nSo with less code writing happening now in enterprises, it begs the question: Are organizations taking up \"[vibe coding](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-where-everyone-can-speak-computer-programming/),\" the practice of prompting an AI system to create software?\n_Proceed with caution_ seems to be the motto in enterprise environments. Wald noted that some organizations have even banned the use of vibe coding for \"brownfield\" applications (where there is existing software complexity), due to the risk of unintended consequences. Other organizations are embracing vibe coding, but in more controlled ways.\n\"Where I see that [vibe coding] being very valuable is on the rapid prototyping, the high fidelity mock-ups and wire framing,\" Wald said. \"It does an extremely good job of doing that type of stuff. And new applications -- I want to spin up a new application, and here's the architecture, here's the tools that I want you to use, go spin up the foundation of this. Using vibe coding to do that can get you 90% of the way there in 10% of the time.\"\n> \"…don't have it go and try to do some big, massive task -- it's going to fail miserably.\"  \n>  **- Wald on vibe coding in the enterprise**\nBut with existing applications, there is much more caution within enterprise environments.\n\"When it comes to solving things in our existing business applications, you may want to use [vibe coding] to help redesign a function, but don't have it go and try to do some big, massive task -- it's going to fail miserably.\"\n## Agentic Systems: Early Days\nThe other big catchphrase this year has been \"[agentic systems](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-are-starting-to-automate-the-enterprise/).\" I asked Wald how enterprises are practically deploying AI agent technologies.\nAgain, he emphasized that enterprises are focused on structured implementations, rather than open experimentation. Enterprises are not letting every developer freely use AI agents, he said. Instead, they're forming centralized \"AI enablement\" teams, which often overlap with [platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) or [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) teams.\nThe AI enablement teams are building predefined, contextual workflows and [agents](https://thenewstack.io/llama-stack-released-to-help-developers-build-agentic-apps/) tailored to company needs -- he mentioned remediation bots as a recurring example within enterprises. These bots identify issues in logs or observability pipelines, and assign responsibility to fix.\n> AI enablement teams are building predefined, contextual workflows and agents tailored to company needs.\nHe added that enterprise IT teams typically have strict policies around data privacy, IP protection, and model hosting. So there are various questions that have to be addressed.\n\"Can we use this AI LLM model? Where is it hosted? What is it doing? Is it the right model with the right either [RAG](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-add-rag-to-ai-agents-for-contextual-understanding/) or [MCP server](https://thenewstack.io/mcp-the-missing-link-between-ai-agents-and-apis/), to give the context [of] our organization in there without exposing IP risk? And so they're still in that stage of things, but allowing their teams to […] do things inside those guardrails.\"\nIn other words, it's still early days for agentic systems.\n## Advice for Developers\nFinally, I asked Wald if he has advice for developers within enterprise. Should they pivot to becoming IT architects? Or are there other ways they can upskill as software engineers?\nWald emphasized that understanding the fundamentals of software engineering is still crucial, along with getting your head around LLMs.\n\"The best engineers who are using AI today have a really, really strong underlying fundamental understanding of the code that they're writing and what they're doing prior to that. Like, there's this notion that [AI is] going to allow non-technical people to be able to write code; and although that's true with vibe coding and they can get pretty far, they always hit a wall. And it's because they don't really understand what's happening inside the code, and they can't analyze that, and they can't say, 'yeah, I don't think that's the right decision here, let me give you some more context.'\"\n> Developers now need to understand business logic deeply.\nIn terms of adapting to the shift from coding to orchestrating, Wald said that developers now need to understand business logic deeply -- which historically hasn't always been the case, because often that was the responsibility of a product manager.\n\"Now you have to be not just an architect for engineering, but you also have to understand the business side of it as well -- so that you're making the right decision, so you can tell the AI what it needs to do so that it works with the output of the product more effectively.\"\nThe post [The Field CTO View: AI, Vibe Coding, and Developer Skillsets](https://thenewstack.io/the-field-cto-view-ai-vibe-coding-and-developer-skillsets/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "Application timeouts are a frustrating reality for DevOps professionals working in open source environments, like OpenShift, OpenStack and Kubernetes. These timeouts, often stemming from storage bottlenecks, can severely hurt application performance, leading to frustrated end users, lost productivity and blown service-level agreements.\nImage 1\nSoftware-defined storage engineered for consistent low latency ensures your applications run smoothly, even for the most demanding workloads at scale.\nLet's get to the root causes of application timeouts in open source environments and explore how [NVMe](https://thenewstack.io/why-nvme-is-a-better-choice-for-your-data-center/) over TCP (NVMe/TCP) and software-defined storage (SDS) will accelerate the performance and reliability of your data platform and eliminate application timeouts.\n## What Triggers an App Timeout?\nBefore effectively addressing application timeouts, it's crucial to understand their underlying causes. Application timeouts occur when an application tries to access storage but does not receive a response within a specified time frame. In open source environments, this can be caused by several factors:\n  * **High latency** : Latency, the delay in accessing storage, is a major culprit behind timeouts. Traditional storage systems may struggle to keep pace with the demands of modern cloud-based applications, leading to increased latency and, consequently, timeouts.\n  * **IOPS limitations** : IOPS (input/output operations per second) is a metric that reflects the number of read and write operations a storage system can handle per second. If your storage infrastructure has limited IOPS, it may become overwhelmed by the application workload, resulting in timeouts.\n  * **Network bottlenecks** : The network connecting your applications to your storage can also become a bottleneck. If the network infrastructure is not designed to handle the demands of high-performance applications, it can contribute to latency and timeouts.\n\n\n## A Performance Boost for Red Hat OpenShift and OpenStack\n[Software-defined storage](https://www.lightbitslabs.com/product/?utm_source=TNS&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may) offers a compelling solution to the challenges of application timeouts in OpenShift, OpenStack and Kubernetes environments. By decoupling storage software from hardware, [SDS introduces a layer of flexibility and efficiency](https://thenewstack.io/understanding-software-defined-storage/) that can significantly enhance performance.\n  * **Performance amplification** : SDS solutions are designed to deliver high IOPS and low latency, which can dramatically improve the overall performance of your OpenStack applications.\n  * **Scalability on demand** : One of the key advantages of SDS is its inherent scalability. As your storage needs grow, you can easily add more capacity and performance without disrupting your operations.\n  * **Resilience and reliability** : SDS solutions often incorporate features such as data redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring the availability of your data even in the event of hardware failures. This added layer of protection minimizes the risk of data loss and downtime.\n\n\n### Key Considerations for Software-Defined Storage Implementations\nWhen implementing an SDS solution in your OpenShift, OpenStack, and Kubernetes environments, it's crucial to consider the underlying storage protocol. [NVMe/TCP storage](https://www.lightbitslabs.com/nvme-over-tcp/), invented by Lightbits Labs, is a high-performance protocol that is well-suited for performance-sensitive applications in these environments due to its low consistent latency and high-throughput capabilities.\nNetwork infrastructure also plays a critical role in the application performance. Network latency, bandwidth, congestion and packet loss can affect performance. Lost packets need to be retransmitted, which increases latency and reduces overall throughput.\nTo avoid these network-related performance issues, it's essential to ensure that your network infrastructure is designed to handle the demands of high-performance storage traffic. This may involve using high-bandwidth network adapters, implementing quality of service (QoS) policies, and optimizing network configurations.\n[Ceph Storage](https://www.lightbitslabs.com/blog/ceph-storage/?utm_source=TNS&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may) is a widely adopted open source software-defined storage platform for diverse workloads in cloud environments, including [Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention) OpenShift and OpenStack deployments. Ceph's popularity in these environments stems from its cost-effectiveness as an open source solution.\nThe NVMe/TCP implementation model (NVM Express or Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification) involves the integration of Ceph's NVMe-oF ([NVMe over Fabrics](https://thenewstack.io/nvme-of-substantially-reduces-data-access-latency/)) gateway. This model can introduce architectural complexity, leading to bottlenecks and increased storage networking latency caused by the extra hop and protocol translation.\nCeph NVMe-oF gateway from IBM Storage Ceph product documentation, \"[Ceph NVMe-oF gateway (Technology Preview)](https:/www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-ceph/7?topic=devices-ceph-nvme-gateway-technology-preview)\"\nWhile Ceph strives to support modern high-speed protocols such as NVMe/TCP, the current approach involves using protocol gateways and translation layers atop the existing [Ceph architecture](https://thenewstack.io/ceph-20-years-of-cutting-edge-storage-at-the-edge/). This model may improve Ceph's interoperability, but it deviates from the originally intended design of NVMe/TCP architectures, and may not deliver the latency and performance requirements to eliminate application timeouts in OpenShift, OpenStack or Kubernetes.\nFurthermore, optimizing the resources available to your storage targets is crucial for maximizing the benefits of SDS. This includes ensuring that your targets have sufficient CPU cores, memory and fast network adapters to handle the storage workload efficiently.\n## Conclusion\nApplication timeouts can be a significant impediment to smooth operations. However, by embracing SDS, DevOps professionals can unlock a new level of performance, scalability and reliability. SDS offers a compelling approach to enhance application performance and optimize storage management in open source deployments.\nAs you explore SDS options, consider factors such as the underlying protocol. NVMe/TCP has emerged on the scene as a cost-efficient option with no compromise, offering exceptional performance and user experiences.\nTo learn more about software-defined storage and compare two leading NVMe over TCP solutions side by side, visit our [Ceph vs. Lightbits performance comparison](https://www.lightbitslabs.com/ceph-vs-lightbits-comparison/).\nThe post [No More Waiting: Eliminate Application Timeouts](https://thenewstack.io/no-more-waiting-eliminate-application-timeouts/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "AI assistants are becoming increasingly central to product experiences, and a new standard has emerged to help build them: the Model Context Protocol (MCP). With adoption from major large language model (LLM) providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini, the protocol has quickly gained traction among the broader software ecosystem, with companies left and right building their own MCP servers.\nAs someone involved in [building both MCP servers](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-build-a-simple-mcp-server-with-claude-desktop/) and API integrations, I've seen this rapid adoption lead to confusion. Some developers and product managers view MCP as an API replacement, while others see MCP as inferior to APIs.\nThe reality is more nuanced: MCP and APIs are complementary. Many well-designed AI systems will need both, and some AI engineers may not build a system with enough complexity to warrant using MCP.\nTo help you understand which solution is right for your specific scenario, I'll explain how each one works, its limitations, and how they work together.\n## **How MCP and APIs Fit Together**\nAt its core, MCP provides a standardized way for large language models to interact with external data sources, but those interactions typically happen through existing APIs. When an LLM invokes a tool from an MCP server to, for example, create a ticket in Jira, an API call is still made to the relevant Jira endpoint.\nMCP's value comes from its [management of context between LLMs and data](https://thenewstack.io/aws-brings-trusted-extension-support-to-managed-postgres/) sources. It provides a standardized framework for:\n  1. **Tool selection and invocation:** MCP allows LLMs to dynamically choose which tools to use based on user prompts rather than requiring hardcoded API calls.\n  2. **Context retention:** The protocol helps LLMs retain, update, and get context, which is crucial for managing multistep workflows.\n  3. **Simplified interactions:** MCP makes it easier for LLMs and applications to integrate by providing a standard protocol.\n\n\nMeanwhile, [APIs still handle the core data](https://thenewstack.io/the-fundamentals-of-data-api-design/) transmission, authentication flows, and connections to different applications.\n## **MCP 's Security Challenges Require API-Level Solutions**\nMCP's flexible and [open architecture introduces unique security](https://thenewstack.io/the-3-ss-of-software-supply-chain-security-sboms-signing-slimming/) challenges. Developers want to use as many tools (API endpoints) as possible. This leads to keys that often have blanket access to sensitive services like email, confidential planning tools, and sales data. As another example, an LLM might mistake field labels (confusing \"SN\" for social security number rather than surname) and inadvertently expose sensitive data.\nTo prevent situations like these, engineers need to integrate access control levels, schema enforcement, and data loss prevention. The most effective approach for doing this involves combining MCP's context [management capabilities with robust API infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/ansible-vs-salt-which-is-best-for-configuration-management/).\nFor example, an API provider's authentication method (e.g., OAuth 2.0) enables the LLM to confirm whether the user has the necessary permissions to access the underlying API endpoint. And the API provider's response codes can help your LLM diagnose and tackle issues (such as alerting the user when a request fails and offering up a solution to address it).\n## **Most AI Use Cases Only Call for APIs**\nI'm seeing AI teams adopting MCPs to paper over deeper issues, like disorganized retrieval systems, out of control prompt chains, and a lack of clear conventions across teams. Instead of fixing the architecture, they add another layer, resulting in more abstraction and less clarity.\nThese AI teams don't need MCP yet; they just [need to clean up their prompts and data](https://thenewstack.io/what-are-time-series-databases-and-why-do-you-need-them/) pipelines (by building robust API integrations). If a team is just using MCP to organize the infrastructure layer, it's probably premature.\nMCP is powerful when you've earned the complexity: juggling multiple models, sources, and downstream consumers, and need structured contracts. But until then, consider building consistency across your infrastructure first and then implementing automated policies for archiving, deduplication, and permissions management to reduce manual overhead and maintain order.\n## **Understanding When and How to Leverage Each Will Give You a Competitive Advantage**\nAs we build increasingly sophisticated AI assistants, it's crucial to understand that MCP and APIs are complementary layers in an integration ecosystem. MCP provides the context management layer that helps LLMs interact more effectively with external systems, while [APIs offer secure](https://thenewstack.io/the-state-of-api-management-in-an-age-of-ai-insecurity/), reliable connections to those systems.\nThe companies that successfully build truly useful AI assistants will recognize this relationship and invest in robust API infrastructure, organized retrieval systems, and standardized conventions before they can build effective MCP implementations -- if it's even necessary.\nThe post [Why APIs Are Essential and MCP Is Optional (for Now)](https://thenewstack.io/why-apis-are-essential-and-mcp-is-optional-for-now/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "For years, we've treated data quality as an analytics problem, heaving dirty data over the fence to the data team to be cleaned up later in the data warehouse or lake.\nThis approach doesn't work for AI. [GenAI applications](https://thenewstack.io/genai-is-quickly-reinventing-it-operations-leaving-many-behind/) operate in real time, making decisions on the fly. If your data is wrong, incomplete or poorly structured, [AI won't fix it.](https://thenewstack.io/ai/) It'll just make bad decisions faster.\nThis is why [data modeling](https://thenewstack.io/data-models-a-key-step-on-your-data-journey/) has to shift left.\nYou can't wait until the analytics layer to enforce data quality when AI agents need to reason, plan and act in the moment. It's like driving a car while only seeing the road every five minutes. How long before you crash?\nLet's explore why AI belongs in the operational layer, why data models matter more than ever and how bridging structured and unstructured data unlocks real-time intelligence.\n## AI in the Operational Estate, Not the Analytics Estate\nFor years, AI followed the same playbook as analytics: Collect data, aggregate it in a warehouse or lake, clean it up, train a model and then use that model to make predictions. That process made sense when AI was purely about retrospective analysis.\nBut GenAI flips this on its head.\nTraditional model training pipeline with data aggregation in a warehouse\nWith GenAI, the AI model is already built. The way you make it useful isn't by aggregating historical data; it's by feeding it fresh, domain-specific context at runtime. And that context lives in the operational layer, not in a warehouse.\nGenAI applications use general-purpose models but make them app-specific during prompt assembly.\nTrying to force AI into the analytics stack doesn't work. Aggregation is too slow. Reverse ETL (extract, transform, load) can't patch the gap with brittle and slow point-to-point pipelines. By the time the data is pipelined back from the analytics estate to the operational estate, the data is stale.\nFor example, consider the chat interaction below with a GenAI-powered assistant for flights. The assistant needs to know recent flights, upcoming flights, the layout of a plane and the customer's preferences for flying. The most reliable up-to-date information to properly contextualize the prompt for the AI lives in the operational layer of the app stack, like the airline reservation system.\nExample of an AI-powered conversation to rebook a flight\nThis is why AI belongs in the application stack, embedded in workflows, interacting with live data.\n## Data Models: A Critical Component for AI Applications\nHistorically, data modeling was a business intelligence (BI) and analytics concern, focused on structuring data for dashboards and reports. However, AI applications shift this responsibility to the operational layer, where real-time decisions are made.\nWhile foundation models are incredibly smart, they can also be incredibly dumb. They have vast general knowledge but lack context and your information. They need structured and unstructured data to provide this context, or they risk hallucinating and producing unreliable outputs.\nTake retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as an example.\nThe common focus is often on semantic search over unstructured, vectorized data, retrieving relevant documents to supply additional context to a large language model (LLM). However, real-world RAG implementations typically require a hybrid approach. This approach involves structured search and data retrieved from databases, CRMs or transactional systems to retrieve precise information like customer records, inventory levels or financial data.\nHybrid search model for RAG applications\nWith semantic search alone, you may retrieve loosely relevant but inaccurate information, leading to responses that are contextually plausible but incorrect for the specific business case.\nEven in purely semantic search applications, having a structured data model that defines relationships between core business entities helps validate LLM-generated responses. A knowledge graph, a specialized form of a conceptual model, provides this structured understanding by capturing entities and their interrelationships within a domain.​\nFor example, consider an application that manages a high-school track meet.\nKey entities might include athletes, events and attendees, with relationships such as athletes participating in events and attendees viewing events. However, without a standardized data model, inconsistencies can arise; some might refer to runners instead of athletes, excluding non-running participants, or use spectators instead of attendees, raising questions about whether event judges are included.\nExample data model for a track meet\nImplementing a knowledge graph ensures a shared, precise understanding of these entities and their relationships. This can be expressed in graph form or natural language, and used directly in prompts to improve accuracy or validate model outputs during post-processing.​\n[GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16130), a structured and hierarchical approach to RAG, uses knowledge graphs to enhance LLM responses. By modeling entities and relationships as units during retrieval, GraphRAG more accurately understands query intent and provides precise search results. For instance, [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data) demonstrated that using LLM-generated knowledge graphs in GraphRAG significantly improves question-and-answer performance when analyzing complex information.\nA well-defined data model enables cross-checking of retrieved insights against structured representations, ensuring that outputs are not only generally accurate but also aligned with specific business definitions and relationships. While RAG applications focus on retrieval, AI agents take it a step further by acting on the information. A robust data model provides agents with a clear understanding of the world they operate in, ensuring informed decisions rather than plausible guesses.\n## The Future: Data Models for AI Agents\nAgents don't just generate text, they query, update and take action on operational systems. To do this reliably, they need structured data models that define the rules of the world in which they operate.\nA well-formed data model enables agents to understand real-time relationships, execute plans and interact with enterprise systems through tool calling and APIs. Without structure, agents face issues with unreliability and will be unable to fully engage with business logic or execute complex workflows.\nA data model serves as the ground truth for agents (and all AI applications), enabling them to:\n  * **Validate and refine outputs** - A strong data model ensures that AI-generated responses align with actual business logic, reducing errors and hallucinations.\n  * **Understand real-time relationships** - Agents need structured representations of business entities to make sense of data as it changes.\n  * **Enable interoperability to downstream systems** - AI applications and agents don't operate in isolation; their outputs will be consumed by multiple services like data warehouses and other analytical systems. Producing data that adheres to a known data model helps facilitate this process.\n  * **Improve orchestration and reliability** - Clearly defined inputs and outputs help coordinate multiple agents, ensuring they work together effectively.\n  * **Support tool calling and automation** - Whether retrieving customer records, managing inventory or executing workflows, agents rely on structured data to interact with enterprise applications in a meaningful way.\n\n\n## Data Modeling Today\nData modeling has evolved far beyond its strictly relational, entity-relationship roots.\nToday, polyglot data modeling supports a variety of data types and sources, including relational tables, hierarchical JSON, graph databases, APIs and document stores. This flexibility is crucial for AI applications, which consume and process data from multiple structured and unstructured sources in real time. It unifies these diverse data representations into a single model that AI applications can use.\nBy integrating data from different databases, APIs, query engines and document stores, this approach simplifies model extraction, design and evolution across both operational and analytical data sources. Developers use modeling tools to create data contracts via REST APIs or schemas, ensuring AI accesses real-time operational data.\n### Why AI Needs Polyglot Data Modeling\nTraditional data models were built for specific systems, relational for transactions, documents for flexibility and graphs for relationships. But AI requires all of them at once because an AI agent might talk to the transactional database first for enterprise application data, such as flight schedules from our previous example. Then, based on that response, query a document to build a prompt that uses a semantic web representation for flight-rescheduling logic. In this case, a single model format isn't enough.\nThis is why polyglot data modeling is key. It allows AI to work across structured and unstructured data in real time, ensuring that both knowledge retrieval and decision-making are informed by a complete view of business data.\nVectors, stored within tables, documents or external vector databases, serve as attributes that link AI-generated knowledge with core business logic. Classic data-modeling principles, whether entity-relationship or domain-driven design, can incorporate vectors as just another attribute, ensuring AI outputs remain structured and contextualized.\n### The Importance of Structure in AI Decision-Making\nAI introduces a high degree of nondeterminism.\nResponses vary; models can drift and errors can propagate unpredictably. In enterprise settings, where reliability and accuracy matter, introducing control wherever possible is critical. When errors occur or bad data is generated, there must be a way to catch and handle issues before they affect operations.\nTools like [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a Python library, enable developers to define clear data models with specific types and constraints. By enforcing these rules, Pydantic ensures that incoming data adheres to expected formats, reducing errors and enhancing data quality. See the article \"[Data Validation With Pydantic](https://www.netguru.com/blog/data-validation-pydantic)\" for more on this.\nData models provide structure and control over an inherently stochastic process. They enforce relationships, constraints and validation to keep AI aligned with business rules. A well-formed polyglot model doesn't just organize data, it adds guardrails, reduces uncertainty and improves the reliability of AI-driven decisions.\nBeyond traditional data validation, integrating ontologies and knowledge graphs can further improve the accuracy of AI-driven decision-making.\nRecent research demonstrates that using ontologies for query validation and repair in question-answering systems can significantly boost response accuracy. For instance, employing an Ontology-Based Query Check (OBQC) alongside LLM repair techniques increased accuracy from [16% to over 72%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11706), underscoring the value of structured semantic representations in AI applications.\nBy combining precise data models with semantic structures like ontologies, organizations can establish comprehensive validation frameworks. These frameworks not only ensure data integrity but also provide contextual grounding for AI systems, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes.\n## Practical Considerations for Designing AI Applications\nEarlier, we outlined five key goals for data modeling in AI applications. Below, we explore how polyglot data modeling addresses each of these challenges.\n### Validate and Refine Outputs\nAI can produce responses that are plausible but incorrect.\nPolyglot models apply constraints across structured and vector data. These constraints are enforced in physical schemas, ensuring that all data sources maintain integrity.\nDomains standardize key data types across APIs and databases. Whether handling customer IDs, order numbers or product SKUs, domains ensure consistent validation and enforcement, reducing the risk of AI-generated errors.\n### Understanding Real-Time Relationships\nAI agents need to reason over dynamic, real-time data, not just static, preaggregated knowledge.\nPolyglot models support semantic web structures and knowledge graphs, enabling AI to map relationships between structured and unstructured data. This is particularly valuable for agents that process information from multiple sources simultaneously.\nAdditionally, conformed dimensions standardize the way key business entities, such as customers, transactions and products, are represented across systems. This ensures that an AI agent retrieving customer data from a CRM and a support database understands they refer to the same individual, preventing fragmented or misleading insights.\n### Enabling Interoperability to Downstream Systems\nAI applications rarely operate in isolation; they must interact with multiple systems, data sources and services.\nPolyglot models establish a common schema framework, ensuring that AI agents can query, transform and share data consistently across different applications. Conformed dimensions and domains create a shared language for AI systems, making it easier to align structured and unstructured data sources.\nBy defining flexible, evolvable schemas, polyglot modeling enables AI to join data streams dynamically, supporting schema evolution as business needs change. AI applications can seamlessly adapt to new data sources without requiring extensive rework.\n### Improve Orchestration and Reliability\nWithout structured orchestration, AI agents risk inconsistency and duplication.\nPolyglot data models improve orchestration by standardizing the way agents communicate, exchange data and track workflows. By defining clear relationships between entities, they enable agents to maintain shared context across multiple interactions, ensuring consistency even as workflows evolve dynamically.\n### Supporting AI Tool Use and Function Calls\nAI isn't just about generating responses, it must execute actions, whether retrieving a customer record, processing an order or triggering a workflow.\nPolyglot models connect enterprise data with AI-driven automation for real-time function calls. Agents can interact with APIs and transactional databases while maintaining a structured understanding of which actions are valid based on business rules.\nAs AI applications evolve, polyglot models allow schemas and APIs to be refined and extended, ensuring AI systems remain aligned with operational requirements. Whether integrating with ERP systems, inventory databases or messaging platforms, a well-structured data model provides the interface AI needs to act with confidence.\n## Why Polyglot Data Modeling Matters for AI\nAI is only as good as the data it understands. A strong data model keeps it grounded, ensuring accurate outputs, real-time reasoning and seamless system integration.\nShifting left with polyglot data modeling bridges structured and unstructured data, enforcing integrity and making AI reliable. AI won't replace data modeling; it runs on it.\nThe post [AI Won’t Save You From Your Data Modeling Problems](https://thenewstack.io/ai-wont-save-you-from-your-data-modeling-problems/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "At [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), I sat down with Google's [Bobby Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ballen-clt/). While he describes himself as a \"cloud therapist,\" his official title is Group Product Manager for [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://thenewstack.io/google-kubernetes-engine-customized-for-faster-ai-work/). And while Google's current focus seems to be almost 100% on AI, it's these [cloud native technologies](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/ \"cloud native technologies\") like Kubernetes that are at the core of what makes these systems work.\n## GKE As An AI Platform\n\"GKE is a phenomenal platform for AI in so many ways, directly and indirectly,\" Allen said. \"So let's hit the indirectly first. Indirectly, GKE powers things like Vertex AI. So, Vertex AI runs directly on GKE, which to me is part of our superpower, because when you think about us drinking our own champagne, if you will, we have customers like DeepMind and like Vertex AI that leverage, directly or indirectly, our technology and our expertise.\"\nThose groups run their model training and inference on top of GKE, as do plenty of gaming, health care, financial services, life sciences and other businesses.\n\"A lot of digital natives and startups really kind of trust GKE to be the way that they orchestrate a lot of the newer types of resources they need,\" he said.\nThis current focus on AI is also changing how the team thinks about the future of GKE. Over time, Allen argued, Google went from specialized hardware to commoditized hardware and is now back to specialized hardware with the advent of AI accelerators. For all of this, he said, you need an orchestrator that can help manage these resources.\n\"AI is special, but it's not,\" he said. \"I'm kind of contradicting myself, because we see AI as another type of modern workload. So if you think about things that are cloud native, that are scalable, that need to be elastic -- AI has a lot of those characteristics, but it also has some other distinguishing characteristics, like leveraging hardware accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs, sitting at the intersection of high availability, HPC and a lot of innovation. GKE underpins all that well, because a lot of the things that GKE naturally does is literally built for a lot of the types of things we want to do.\"\nSo many of the primitives built into Kubernetes, he said, are tailor-made for those users who want to tune their systems for AI workloads.\nThanks to a lot of this early work that went into Kubernetes, engineers solved issues around scaling those platforms and securing them, Allen noted. And because the range of users today is also extremely broad, services like GKE have the tools built in to handle virtually any workload, with adjacent systems for storage, networking databases, etc. tuned for them.\n\"GKE is the most control with the least technical debt, in my opinion,\" he said. \"Because it's future-proofed in so many ways. Because we know it can scale. We know it can grow. We know the commitment that we have in the open source community, where Google continues to invest at a very aggressive rate.\"\n## GKE as Model Router\nLooking ahead, Allen and his team are thinking about how to better integrate AI models into the overall workflow. Most enterprises, he argued, will not train their own models but they will want model choice.\n\"On that model as a service offering, GKE will support the ability to route you to the model based on the purpose, not necessarily the name,\" he said. \"So maybe you want Meta. Maybe you want Gemma or Gemini. Maybe you just want to say: Hit this inference endpoint, if you're a developer, for image generation, and I don't care what's underneath, right? GKE will allow you to set up that scaffolding to give people the output they want, without knowing the brand or the version of the model.\"\nThe post [Google Cloud Therapist on Bringing AI to Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/google-cloud-therapist-on-bringing-ai-to-cloud-native-infrastructure/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

The other half: reckoning with how much energy AI demands.\nBy 2030 the U.S. alone is set to consume more electricity for data centers than for the production of aluminum, steel, cement, chemicals and all other energy-intensive goods combined, according to [a sweeping report](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/dd7c2387-2f60-4b60-8c5f-6563b6aa1e4c/EnergyandAI.pdf) released in April by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Globally, data center electricity use is set to more than double by 2030 -- surpassing Japan's total energy consumption -- with AI named as the biggest driver.\nAt the same time, adoption of renewable energy brings greater complexity to grid balancing -- the process of ensuring that electricity production matches demand-- and AI may have an important role to play here.\nThe IEA argues that \"there are many potentially beneficial use cases for AI in the energy sector, from accelerating technological innovation and optimizing the operation of electricity systems, to making resource exploration more efficient, and improving weather forecasting and resilience of energy systems to disruptions.\"\nIt is [surely incumbent on all of us ](https://thenewstack.io/what-developers-can-do-to-make-ai-ethical/)to consider how we can use it responsibly. The good news is that sustainable software systems are cheaper to run and more robust than systems built without considering environmental impact. To understand why, let's consider a typical machine learning project lifecycle.\n## Planning To Use AI\nA good working assumption with generative AI specifically is that it is likely the most carbon-intensive way to solve a given problem. I am sympathetic to resume-driven development but a good question to start with is, \"Do I need to solve this using AI?\"\nAs with other forms of [problem solving](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/improve-your-problem-solving/9781098174149/ch01.html), it is best to consider multiple solutions and the cost of each one. Avoid the temptation to use AI just because it is new and shiny, and consider whether the business case justifies the expense.\nIf an AI-based approach is warranted, consider whether you need to train a new model from scratch. [Training is expensive](https://thenewstack.io/meeting-the-operational-challenges-of-training-llms/) and if it can be avoided, so much the better.\nYour [choice of model](https://thenewstack.io/choosing-when-to-use-or-not-use-llms-as-a-developer/) also matters, but unfortunately, useful data is hard to come by. It strikes me as profoundly ironic that an industry that seems to regard everyone else's data as theirs for the taking is remarkably reluctant to share data on its own energy use.\n[ML.Energy](https://ml.energy), a joint effort of computer scientists across multiple academic institutions who are trying to measure, understand, optimize and expose the energy consumption of modern machine learning, [publishes a leaderboard](https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light). This is a fantastic resource that covers large language model (LLM) code and chat, vision language model (VLM) visual chat, text to video and text to image. Unfortunately, it cannot provide information on priority models such as GPT-4, Gemini or Grok.\nTo build it, ML.Energy \"spent a lot of money leasing the most representative production inference hardware from Amazon and ran the most important GenAI models on multiple configurations,\" [Jae-Won Chung](https://github.com/jaywonchung), a doctoral candidate in computer science engineering at the University of Michigan who leads the initiative, told The New Stack.\nData comes from [Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus/), ML.Energy's excellent open source library for measuring the energy consumption of deep learning workloads.\nGiven that neither [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), OpenAI, xAI, nor the other proprietary vendors disclose their carbon costs, the best advice I can offer right now is to choose open source models wherever possible, and use Zeus or the ML.Energy leaderboard to help with selection.\nIf you plan to run the model yourself, the location matters. Look for somewhere with a greener mix of energy and relax your service-level agreement accordingly. A tool such as [Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map/72h/hourly) can help you identify where these locations are.\nAlso consider offering your users a choice regarding whether to use AI or not. Like the eco program on a washing machine, your application or website could have a default eco setting that removes AI-generated content, or uses an alternative mechanism where applicable.\nGoogle, for example, could give customers the option of removing those irritating AI overlays from search results. This would avoid the additional carbon and economic costs, and users could find useful search results without resorting to [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com).\nIn green software circles, this approach is referred to as [demand shaping](https://www.conissaunce.com/demand-shifting-and-shaping.html), one of a pair of oft-mentioned carbon-aware computing techniques that can be applied in a manner that is invisible to the end user.\nUsing an API such as those offered by [WattTime](https://watttime.org) or Electricity Maps, we can ascertain the current state of the grid--using inferencing when the energy is greenest and falling back to more traditional if-then style approaches, or routing queries to human operators at times of higher carbon intensity.\n## How To Make Data Collection Greener\nIf you determine during planning that you do need to train a new model, consider whether you need to collect data for it, or if you can use one of the many freely available open source collections from sites such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).\n[Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io), assistant computer science professor at the University of Copenhagen and author of the forthcoming O'Reilly book, \"[Sustainable AI](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sustainable-ai/9781098155506/),\" also recommends curating data before you start training.\n\"We have this abundance mindset with training, but not all data is equally useful,\" Selvan told The New Stack. \"Even just randomly subsampling your data might get you to 90 or 95% of the performance for a model, and for each epoch [training cycle] you'll save a lot of compute.\"\nActive learning, where you choose the most difficult or informative data points to update the model, is another powerful technique, Selvan suggested.\nSince data collection is not latency-sensitive, we can also reach for another carbon-aware computing tool -- [demand shifting](https://www.conissaunce.com/demand-shifting-and-shaping.html) -- to make use of green energy when it is available. Unlike demand shaping, where we vary how an app behaves based on carbon intensity, with demand shifting, we vary when or where something happens based on carbon intensity.\nFor data collection, moving your workloads may be straightforward. However, if they depend on large amounts of persistent data, moving that data is harder and slower and may not be practical. You may also have to deal with data sovereignty laws, which can be another challenging hurdle. For this reason, it is likely best to use time-based, rather than location-based, demand shifting for this use case.\n## How To Make Training Greener\nA great deal of research on AI and sustainability focuses on the training phase, which means we have a lot of specific options here. I've looked at one, edge-based [federated learning](https://thenewstack.io/ai-at-the-edge-federated-learning-for-greater-performance/), for a previous New Stack post.\nAs with data collection, training is not especially latency-sensitive so it's a good candidate for demand shifting. This may mean that getting your solution to market takes longer, but perhaps that is more of a marketing challenge than a real problem. A message that says, \"We're working on AI using an environmentally sustainable approach, so this will take a little longer\" could well resonate with many of your potential customers.\nTaking time to get it right could also avoid embarrassing problems, such as [making up headlines of fake news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx27zwp7jpxo), recommending [eating rocks and putting glue on pizza](https://news.sky.com/story/glue-cheese-to-pizza-and-eat-rocks-says-googles-new-ai-feature-as-mistakes-flood-social-media-13142528), or [announcing something you can't build](https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features).\n### Compression\nAnother area that shows great promise is model compression. By shrinking the model size, it is possible to speed up training time and increase its efficiency. Shrinking the model size is an ongoing research area, with several initiatives exploring topics like distillation, quantization and pruning as methods of compression.\n#### Distillation\nDistillation involves capturing a set of good representations of training data using a larger model, and then training a smaller model to match the output of the larger model without the smaller model having to rediscover the representations from all training data.\nDistillation hit the headlines after [OpenAI complained](https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6) that DeepSeek must have used it to improve [DeepSeek-R1](https://thenewstack.io/deep-dive-into-deepseek-r1-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do/); it must be frustrating when someone steals your work without permission.\nIn practice, distillation remains challenging, but both [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation) and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/model-distillation/) offer ways to perform it. It is also likely that the emerging category of AI middleware, such as that offered by Broadcom, will add similar capabilities over time. [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) claims that distilled models in Amazon Bedrock are \"up to 500% faster and up to 75% less expensive than original models.\"\n#### Quantization\nQuantization is the process of reducing the precision of a digital signal, typically from a higher-precision to a lower-precision format. Within LLMs the process can be used to convert weights and activation values of high-precision data -- usually 32-bit floating point (FP32) or 16-bit floating point (FP16 or BF16) -- to lower-precision data, like an 8-bit integer (INT8) or even 4-bit or 2-bit.\nAccording to NVIDIA, which implemented quantization training in its [AI model optimization toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ai-toolkit), this should cut the memory requirements by around 29% to 51%. Google has also released [AQT](https://github.com/google/aqt), a software library designed for tensor operation quantization in JAX, on GitHub.\n#### Pruning\nPruning takes its inspiration from a biological process called synaptic pruning. During development, mammals' brains eliminate extra synapses, the brain structures that allow neurons to transmit an electrical or chemical signal to other neurons. This is thought to be the brain's way of removing connections that are no longer needed.\nIn AI, pruning is the practice of removing parameters (individually or in groups) from an existing artificial neural network, again to remove connections or parts of the network that are no longer required.\n\"We start out with way more complex models than needed for a particular task,\" Selvan told The New Stack. \"Once we have our large model, we can use pruning to access the smaller sub-network that is already embedded.\"\nPruning often uses criteria such as low-weight magnitudes, gradients or norm-based thresholds to determine which parameters can be removed. \"Using low-weight magnitudes is a pretty solid technique because there are a lot of dormant weights we can throw away,\" Selvan said.\nHowever, he added, since combinations of weights can affect the gradient during training, \"We can also do a sensitivity analysis to determine if the output of the model changes if you throw away a certain group of weights.\"\nAdditionally, techniques like soft pruning may temporarily mask parameters, allowing them to reduce computational overhead even though memory usage is the same.\nAlthough not pruning in the academic sense, using an ensemble of expert models is another route to efficiency gains. \"DeepSeek has a model with 600 million parameters, but at any given point, only about 1/10th of the model parameters are active,\" Selvan said. \"It's effectively selective activation of a network pathway.\"\n### Energy Optimal Training\nEach of these techniques looks to reduce energy consumption by making machine learning faster or using less computation, trading off against a slight loss in quality. An alternative approach, pioneered by ML.Energy's Chung, is to change how the training is executed to make it energy optimal.\n\"You don't change any of the floating point operations to reduce energy,\" Chung told The New Stack. \"You change how those computations are executed.\"\nSince [AlexNet](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) in 2012, models that are too large to execute on a single GPU get split across multiple processors for training and inferencing. Chung's key insight is that splitting the training model workload amongst thousands of GPUs introduces inefficiencies because it is impossible to make every piece the same size.\nThe GPUs are, however, synchronized and have a shared deadline for when computation should finish. He realized that if GPUs with smaller workloads ran slower, consuming much less power, they would still finish at the same time as GPUs processing larger workloads operating at full speed. The trick was to pace each GPU in such a way that the whole cluster would finish simultaneously.\nTo achieve this, Chung built a piece of software called [Perseus](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3694715.3695970). Evaluations on large models, including GPT-3 and Bloom, show that Perseus reduces energy consumption by up to 30% without any throughput loss or hardware modification.\nPerseus is open sourced under Apache v2 as the [Zeus Pipeline Frequency Optimizer.](https://ml.energy/zeus/optimize/pipeline_frequency_optimizer/) It's still in early-stage development and inevitably has some rough edges, but Chung is keen to make it suitable for production.\n\"We are serious about making our open source software real-world usable, not just a dump of research artifacts,\" he said. The researchers are speaking to [Meta](https://about.meta.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and NVIDIA about getting the technology adopted in industry.\nThe team has some other fascinating ideas to take this further. \"Another of my students is looking at how we can optimize energy consumption for each of the individual kernels,\" Chung's Ph.D supervisor, Mosharaf Chowdhury, told The New Stack. \"We are looking into energy-optimal compilation that will produce efficient kernels while keeping the same runtime.\"\nThis work is at an early stage, Chowdhury told us: \"Our current estimate is that by doing this very fine-grained control on top of Perseus, we can get another 10 to 20% improvement.\"\n## Deployment and Maintenance\nOnce a model is deployed in production it may run a huge number of times. It therefore seems likely that deployment and maintenance may be where the most carbon is used. Numbers released by Google suggest around 60% for running costs, versus 40% for training.\nThe three compression techniques we looked at -- quantization, distillation and pruning -- can all be applied post-training to decrease the size of the model used for inferencing. Selvan suggested that with quantization in particular, it might also be worth considering hardware choice.\n\"I might make a really smart quantization algorithm that can do things in two or three bits,\" Selvan said. \"But if my hardware doesn't support it, I still have to run it in eight bits and pay an additional computation cost for converting back.\"\nUsing hardware such as an FPGA, \"you could encode your 3-bit or 4-bit natively, saving both memory and compute,\" Selvan told us. \"I think this is the next step; to get all the benefits from compression, it has to be natively supported in the hardware.\"\nAnother promising technique, pioneered by Google, is [speculative decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192). Conventionally, an LLM generates its output one token at a time, where a token is usually a word or part of a word. While GPUs and TPUs are highly parallel machines, since each token depends on the ones previously produced, they must be generated one by one, reading all of the model's weights repeatedly.\nSpeculative decoding works similarly to branch prediction in modern pipelined CPUs. The goal is to increase concurrency by computing several tokens in parallel, reducing the inference times for LLMs significantly. It is predicated on the observation that some tokens are easier to generate than others, which means that a smaller model might do as well as a larger model on easier tokens, and that LLM inference is usually bottlenecked on memory.\nIn their original paper, Google's researchers found that applying speculative decoding to accelerate an 11B parameter T5-XXL model for a translation task, and using a smaller 60M parameter T5-small as the guessing mechanism, they got approximately a 3x improvement in speed.\nI find it extremely encouraging to see so much serious effort being put into reducing the environmental cost of AI. But do keep in mind that AI is ultimately just another computer workload and therefore the same rules apply:\n  * Use the smallest hardware configuration that can safely execute the job.\n  * Run compute in areas where low-carbon electricity is abundant and where there are credible plans to make the grid even cleaner.\n  * Use cloud services from cloud providers that have data centers in green locations and provide good tooling to help reduce your footprint.\n  * And optimize the execution time of jobs to further reduce the footprint.\n\n\nFor more on how to achieve this, refer to [our free eBook](https://www.conissaunce.com/sustainability-ebook.html).\nThe post [AI Consumes Lots of Energy.

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "In the [previous part](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers/) of this series, I introduced the basic concepts of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) -- an [open standard](https://thenewstack.io/mcp-the-missing-link-between-ai-agents-and-apis/) designed to streamline how AI models [interact with external tools](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-bridges-llms-to-the-apps-they-need/), data sources and resources. In this installment, I'll walk you through the step-by-step process of building an MCP server and integrating it with Claude Desktop.\nWe'll use Python and [FastMCP 2.0](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome) to build an MCP server that utilizes the [FlightAware API](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/). For more information on FlightAware, refer to the [previous tutorial](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-a-real-time-app-with-gpt-4o-function-calling/), where I integrated it with large language model (LLM) tools. Ensure that you have a valid FlightAware API key before proceeding.\nIn subsequent parts of this series, I'll demonstrate how to extend this to work with AI agents built with [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) and [Google Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) (ADK).\n## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment\nLet's start by creating a virtual environment and installing the required Python modules:  \n\n```\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n  \n\n```\npip install requests fastmcp pytz\n```\n\n## Step 2: Building the MCP Server\nFirst, import the required Python modules in the code:  \n\n```\nimport json\nimport os  \nimport requests\nimport pytz\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Set, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n```\n\n  \nThe next step is to create the MCP object from FastMCP:  \n\n```\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Flight Server\")\n```\n\n  \nWe'll then create a function and decorate it with the `@mcp.tool()` annotation to explicitly identify it as a tool:  \n\n```\n@mcp.tool()\ndef get_flight_status(flight):\n    \"\"\"Returns Flight Information\"\"\"\n    AEROAPI_BASE_URL = \"https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi\"\n    AEROAPI_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n \n    def get_api_session():\n        session = requests.Session()\n        session.headers.update({\"x-apikey\": AEROAPI_KEY})\n        return session\n \n    def fetch_flight_data(flight_id, session):\n        if \"flight_id=\" in flight_id:\n            flight_id = flight_id.split(\"flight_id=\")[1]    \n        \n        start_date = datetime.now().date().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n        end_date = (datetime.now().date() + timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n        api_resource = f\"/flights/{flight_id}?start={start_date}&amp;end={end_date}\"  # Fixed &amp; to &amp;\n        \n        try:\n            response = session.get(f\"{AEROAPI_BASE_URL}{api_resource}\")\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            json_data = response.json()\n            \n            # Print the response for debugging\n            print(\"API Response:\", json.dumps(json_data, indent=2))\n            \n            if 'flights' not in json_data or len(json_data['flights']) == 0:\n                return None\n            \n            return json_data['flights'][0]\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error fetching flight data: {e}\")\n            return None\n \n    def utc_to_local(utc_date_str, local_timezone_str):\n        utc_datetime = datetime.strptime(utc_date_str, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ').replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n        local_timezone = pytz.timezone(local_timezone_str)\n        local_datetime = utc_datetime.astimezone(local_timezone)\n        return local_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')    \n    \n    session = get_api_session()\n    flight_data = fetch_flight_data(flight, session)\n    \n    if flight_data is None:\n        return json.dumps({\n            'error': 'Failed to retrieve flight data. Check the API key and flight ID.',\n            'flight': flight\n        })\n    \n    try:\n        dep_key = 'estimated_out' if 'estimated_out' in flight_data and flight_data['estimated_out'] else \\\n              'actual_out' if 'actual_out' in flight_data and flight_data['actual_out'] else \\\n              'scheduled_out'\n        \n        arr_key = 'estimated_in' if 'estimated_in' in flight_data and flight_data['estimated_in'] else \\\n              'actual_in' if 'actual_in' in flight_data and flight_data['actual_in'] else \\\n              'scheduled_in'    \n        \n        flight_details = f\"\"\"\nFlight: {flight}\nSource: {flight_data['origin']['city']}\nDestination: {flight_data['destination']['city']}\nDeparture Time: {utc_to_local(flight_data[dep_key], flight_data['origin']['timezone'])}\nArrival Time: {utc_to_local(flight_data[arr_key], flight_data['destination']['timezone'])}\nStatus: {flight_data['status']}\n\"\"\"\n        return flight_details\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error processing flight data: {e}\")\n        return json.dumps({\n            'error': f'Error processing flight data: {str(e)}',\n            'flight': flight\n        })\n```\n\n  \nThe last step is to create the main function to run the server if it's executed directly:  \n\n```\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":  \n    mcp.run()\n```\n\n  \nThat's it! We're done building our first MCP server. It's time to put it to the test by integrating it with Claude Desktop.\n## Step 3: Integrating With Claude Desktop\nEnsure you have the latest version of [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download). Open the Settings menu to access the Developer tab:\nClick on the Edit Config button to access the MCP settings file named `claude_desktop_config.json`.\nOpen the file in your favorite editor and add the following content:  \n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"flight\": {\n      \"command\": \"/Users/janakiramm/Demo/venv/bin/python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/Users/janakiramm/Demo/flight_server.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  \nReplace the path with the absolute path to your Python environment and MCP server and save the file.\nRestart Claude, and you should now find your MCP server within the settings option.\nMake sure it's turned on. Now we're all set to use our MCP server from Claude.\nIt's time to test the MCP server by asking Claude about a flight schedule. Claude will ask for your permission to access a third-party service.\nOnce you allow it, Claude will invoke the MCP server and fetch the data, which acts as the context to the original prompt.\nAs we can see from the output, Claude invoked the MCP server to fetch the real-time status. Note that we are using the STDIO transport.\nYou can find the entire code in the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/janakiramm/ebe15d88c9ddac62bbcc9540870da94b) below:\nView the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/janakiramm/ebe15d88c9ddac62bbcc9540870da94b).\nIn upcoming articles in this series, we'll explore how to use other transport protocols, including streamable HTTP transport.

    "content": "Way back in the 90s, I was studying [C++](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-c-programming-language/) at a local college. Everyone in the class but me had a [Windows](https://thenewstack.io/ebpf-is-coming-for-windows/) machine. As for myself, I was already a hardcore [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/) user, and there was nothing the professor could say that would sway me back to Windows.\nEven though he suggested using [Microsoft Visual Basic](https://thenewstack.io/visual-basic-lingers-on/) at the time, I was certain I could get through the class using [Linux and the command line](https://thenewstack.io/tns-linux-sb00-3-understand-the-linux-command-line/).\nI did, but it took a bit of work at the beginning. In the end, I completed the course with an A and then promptly forgot everything I'd learned.\nWell, not everything.\nOne thing that stuck with me was that developing from the command line is certainly an option with both pros and cons (just like when using a [GUI](https://thenewstack.io/guis-cli-apis-learn-basic-terms-of-infrastructure-as-code/)). What are those pros and cons? Let's dive in and find out.\n## Pros\nFirst, we'll look at the pros, of which there are plenty to make you think about dropping that GUI.\n### Lower Hardware Requirements\nThis is a big one for a lot of people. Some [IDEs](https://thenewstack.io/best-open-source-ides/) are fairly resource-intensive. The command line… not so much. In fact, you can develop using the command line on any old machine capable of running Linux. Compile times are even faster when working from the command line. Because of this, you don't have to dole out the cash for a top-of-the-line PC to use as a development station. And with so many Linux distributions available for older hardware, even that old machine collecting dust can be of value.\nSo don't get caught up in the idea that you have to have the latest greatest hardware for developing, because the command line gives you far more options that are far cheaper.\n### Better Understanding of How Things Work\nOne thing I learned during that C++ class was how things worked together to create a cohesive whole. Instead of allowing a GUI IDE to do everything, I had to piece together all the bits to create a workstation capable of working with the programming language for the class. In the end, I had a much better understanding of how it all came together (languages, compilers, debuggers, everything) to make it possible to [develop, compile and run applications](https://thenewstack.io/3-recommended-low-code-tools-for-application-development/).\n### More Efficient Workflow\nOne of the cool things that happened during my time with C++ was that I developed an incredibly fast workflow. Instead of moving my hand between keyboard and mouse, I was able to do everything from the keyboard, which led me to create a very efficient workflow. I would often work with other students and found myself getting things done much faster than everyone else, due to the simplicity of how I worked. Once you've created an effective command line workflow, it's hard to match it with a GUI. And given you can use [Git](https://thenewstack.io/linus-torvalds-reflects-on-20-years-of-git/) from the command line, there's really nothing you can't do at a very high level of efficiency.\n### More Flexible Remote Work\nOne really amazing thing I can do with the command line is [SSH](https://thenewstack.io/linux-ssh-and-key-based-authentication/) into a remote machine and do everything I need, without leaving my desk. That means I could develop on my local machine, or secure shell into a remote machine and do the same thing. I could even open multiple terminal windows (or use a terminal app with tabs) and remote into multiple machines and develop on them all during the same session. Yes, there are GUIs that allow you to connect to remote desktops, but getting that to work effectively can be a challenge. With [Linux and SSH](https://thenewstack.io/linux-run-a-single-command-across-multiple-servers-with-ssh/), it's all right there at your disposal, ready to go.\n### Cost Effectiveness\nDeveloping from the command line is cheap. Think about it: You don't have to purchase a single piece of software because it's all right there, built into the OS. Although there are plenty of IDEs that are free or cheap, when you add it all up (including the lower hardware requirements), it all comes down to a very cost-effective method of developing.\n## Cons\nOkay, so it's not all unicorns and rainbows over here in command line land. Here are a few cons you must consider before diving in.\n### Steeper Learning Curve\nWhen I was taking that class, the first few days were a struggle because I not only had to learn how to do things from the command line, but I also had to figure out all of the pieces required to make it work. I needed [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), GCC+, [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and a bunch of other command line tools. On top of that, I had to learn (and memorize) the command line required to compile and debug the apps I'd built. It wasn't exactly easy, but it was a hurdle I overcame within a couple of days.\n### Requires a Bit More Work\nIt's not just about the steeper learning curve, but there's also just a bit more involved. Instead of clicking a button, you have to type a command. Instead of installing searchable plugins, you have to know everything required to take care of the task at hand. All of that means you're going to have to do a bit more work up front. The good news is that, once you've done all that work, everything very quickly smooths out and you're off to the races.\n### Fewer Integrations\nMany IDEs include tons of integrations. If they don't include them out of the box, you can add them via plugins. The command line doesn't work that way. If you need to integrate something into your workflow, it might take a bit of futzing around to make it happen. You might have to chase down the right libraries and figure out how to install them. In the end, if your project depends on a ton of IDE integrations, you might find yourself struggling to get things done from the command line.\n## Conclusion\nIn the end, I felt very fortunate that I was able to get through the class using nothing but the command line for C++ development. I felt I learned more about the process, understood how the language worked and was able to get things done with a level of efficiency I could match using a GUI.\nThe post [The Pros and Cons of Developing From the Command Line](https://thenewstack.io/the-pros-and-cons-of-developing-from-the-command-line/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "Longtime [Kafka](https://thenewstack.io/the-new-look-and-feel-of-apache-kafka-4-0/) users are familiar with a fork in the proverbial road as their applications scale and data accumulates and accumulates and accumulates. [Data storage isn't free](https://thenewstack.io/battling-the-steep-price-of-storage-for-real-time-analytics/), and eventually, the moment of truth arrives when you have to decide to either hang on to all your historical data or keep your storage costs realistic.\nThe arrival of [Kafka's Tiered Storage](https://kafka.apache.org/39/documentation/#tieredstorageconfigs) eliminates that dilemma with a third option: Why not both?\nWith Tiered Storage, the popular open source distributed event streaming platform now lets you automatically split data into two tiers: one that delivers high performance by storing recent and crucial hot data locally and another that places historical data in low-cost cloud object storage.\nTiered Storage transforms the way organizations can tap Kafka at scale, enabling new use cases while simplifying operations and ensuring longer-term data consistency. Here's how it works and why it's a game-changer for every data-hungry Kafka deployment.\n## Cut Costs While Saving Business-Valuable Data\nKafka Tiered Storage preserves the platform's core semantics and APIs, allowing existing applications and their Kafka producers and consumers to function without modification. The architecture functions as a write-through cache. Data initially lands on local storage before being asynchronously copied to remote storage once segments close. Consumers seamlessly read from either local or remote storage as needed, with the underlying complexity completely abstracted away.\nAs organizations grow, their data accumulation accelerates and eventually reaches a point where simply expanding broker storage becomes financially unsustainable. [Cloud object storage](https://thenewstack.io/object-storage-is-key-to-taming-cloud-costs/) costs a fraction of high-performance SSDs, making the economic case for tiered storage immediately compelling to financial stakeholders (in other words, Kafka Tiered Storage is going to make your CFO happy). Meanwhile, technical teams gain powerful new capabilities for historical data analysis and reprocessing that were previously cost-prohibitive.\n## Building a Better Time Machine\nWhile Kafka has always enabled enterprises to \"time travel\" through their data streams, unlocking critical insights and capabilities, the high cost of historical data retention has severely limited this functionality's scope until now.\nKafka Tiered Storage makes extended time travel across years of historical data economically viable, opening up transformative opportunities. Teams can now train machine learning (ML) models on complete historical data sets rather than samples, execute seamless migrations to new sink systems and perform comprehensive compliance auditing across all past transactions.\nThis functionality also helps modernize application development practices. Engineering teams can address bugs by reverting to the exact state before they were introduced, even months after the fact. Applications can undergo thorough A/B testing using parallel processing pipelines against historical data.\nTime-shifted operations, such as running accurate what-if simulations with historical operational data, have now become practical use cases. Even disaster recovery strategies evolve as organizations replace expensive hot infrastructure duplicates with far more affordable cold data storage that can be rapidly deployed on new Kafka clusters when needed.\n## Managing Tiered Performance and Right-Sizing Capacity\nTiered storage means maintaining seamless high-performance access to mission-critical data. That said, a few smart adjustments can optimize performance when accessing historical data in cold cloud storage as well.\nRetention policies should be a microcosm of your tiered storage strategy, keeping often-accessed data locally and using remote storage for less commonly needed data. That remote copying occurs asynchronously, meaning that Kafka producers will function the same as always. However, you should increase cluster CPU and network resources by around 10% to better perform those tiering operations.\nKafka Tiered Storage also changes the equation when planning how much capacity to make available. According to NetApp Instaclustr's benchmark data, reads from hot local storage are often two or three times as fast as from remote cloud storage, with up to 20x degradation with small segment sizes. To maintain the correct capacity, separate workloads and determine your producer input rate, consumer patterns and data to store locally.\nLooking at access patterns, rather than total volume, will help to right-size local retention. Size topics to best serve the parallel processing required for performant access to cloud-stored data, keeping in mind that the partition count greatly affects read performance. Increasing partitions for those topics processing historical data will increase cold storage throughput by enabling more consumers to read data concurrently. If you want to go deep into Kafka Tiered Storage sizing, my Instaclustr colleague Paul Brebner [has you covered](https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/how-to-size-apache-kafka-clusters-for-tiered-storage-part-1/).\n## Kafka's Evolutionary Leap Forward\nKafka Tiered Storage represents the first step in Kafka's evolution toward invisible infrastructure, freeing development teams from storage management concerns to focus on business logic and application development. By automating the complex decisions around data retention and placement, Tiered Storage allows enterprises to concentrate on extracting value from their data rather than managing its underlying infrastructure.\nFuture Kafka releases will likely continue this trajectory, further automating operations while optimizing to meet organizations' increasingly sophisticated data management requirements and rapidly scaling demands.\nThe post [Store More, Pay Less: Welcome to Kafka Tiered Storage](https://thenewstack.io/store-more-pay-less-welcome-to-kafka-tiered-storage/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "LONDON -- The massive and surging volume of software being generated with AI is contributing to skyrocketing cloud costs. It's also exponentially increasing demand for additional compute resources to manage all of that code across cloud native infrastructures. These factors make cloud cost optimization even more critical for enterprises than ever.\nAdding to the challenge, [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) introduces significant complexity at scale. There's often limited visibility into how resources are used and what is being spent -- a difficult environment for cost optimization. But existing [GitOps practices](https://thenewstack.io/4-core-principles-of-gitops/) orchestrated by Flux and Argo CD, based on traditional GitHub- or Git-type operations, are inadequate for proper resource optimization.\nWhat's required is an abstraction geared specifically towards resource optimization. It must automate analytics that cover the minutiae of infrastructure inside every pod and at scale across potentially multiple clusters and cloud and on-premises environments. In addition to automating the operations aspect of infrastructure management, such a platform should remove any concern around resource provisioning that might otherwise involve manual [YAML configuration](https://thenewstack.io/yall-against-my-lingo-why-everyone-hates-on-yaml/) or other operations-related tasks.\n## Waste Makes Waste\nWaste in cloud spending is not necessarily due to negligence or a lack of resources; it's often due to poor visibility and understanding of how to optimize costs and resource allocations. Ironically, Kubernetes and GitOps were designed to enable DevOps practices by providing building blocks to facilitate collaboration between operations teams and developers, Gartner's [Tony Iams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyiams/) wrote in \"[Cost Optimization for Containers and Kubernetes in the Cloud](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5692519).\"\n\"However, while the operations team is responsible for only some sizing aspects, the responsibility for specifying the necessary resources to applications ultimately falls to developer teams,\" Iams wrote. \"The key to implementing optimization is to facilitate collaboration between development and operations teams. With the right tools and practices in place, and by working together, these teams can control the costs of running containers in the cloud and eventually optimize them.\"\nMany organizations that run large-scale or even mid-scale production environments on Kubernetes face a common issue: Workloads are either grossly overprovisioned or severely underprovisioned. Developers set the resource requests for CPU and memory, but they are forced to overprovision because the dynamics of the clusters constantly change. Overprovisioning means resources are allocated but remain unused, but the alternative, underprovisioning, negatively impacts performance. This inefficiency is exacerbated by the increasing workloads and complexity of modern software development, including CI/CD and AI.\nThe main challenge is the multidimensional character of scheduling decisions within Kubernetes clusters. On the one hand, developers set high resource limits and provision for peak demand, while administrators lack accurate data on actual resource needs over time, [Torsten Volk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torstenvolk), an analyst with TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group, told me. At the same time, affinity rules are often set based on simple static labels that are not informed by an application's actual performance requirements. Resource requests only consider CPU and memory, without being able to define network throughput and latency. High-priority apps might unnecessarily evict lower-priority ones, despite not actually requiring more resources, Volk said.\n\"All of this leads to a multilevel guessing game, where developers want to make sure to build in a static buffer to proof their application for worst-case scenarios, while operators are unable to cut down the resulting waste as they do not understand how an application might react,\" Volk said. \"In a nutshell, Kubernetes does not know anything about the real-life resource requirements of an application, while the application pod is entirely unaware of the performance of the underlying cluster hardware.\"\n## Oh, So Human\nHistorically, resource allocation strategies were specified statically in YAML files and synced by a human manager using Flux or Argo CD. While Flux and Argo CD vendors and users seek to integrate resource optimization into their feature sets, they often fall short.\nA few years ago, Git-based workflows were the standard for resource provisioning. However, with the acceleration of software development and CI/CD pipelines, and the rise of AI-generated code, \"these traditional methods are breaking down,\" noted[ Guy Baron,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhinof/?originalSubdomain=il) ScaleOps' CTO and co-founder, when I spoke with him at [KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe](https://thenewstack.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-eu-2025/) in April.\nInstead, automating resource allocation in real time is required, along with optimizing vertical and horizontal scaling and pod placement. Such a platform continuously adjusts resource allocation based on workload needs and cluster health, ensuring efficiency and cost savings across associated multicloud and hybrid infrastructures at scale.\nThe optimization should cover:\n  * Vertical scaling: Adjusting the amount of CPU and memory assigned to each pod.\n  * Horizontal scaling: Optimizing the number of replicas in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or Argo-supported workloads.\n  * Placement optimization: Intelligently scheduling pods to maximize cluster efficiency.\n\n\nScaleOps' platform serves as an example of an option that abstracts and automates the process. It's positioned not as a platform for analysis and visibility but for resource automation. ScaleOps automates decision-making by eliminating the need for manual analysis and intervention, helping resource management become a continuous optimization of the infrastructure map.\nScaling decisions, such as determining how to vertically scale, horizontally scale, and schedule pods onto the cluster to maximize performance and cost savings, are then made in real time. This capability forms the core of the ScaleOps platform.\nSavings and scaling efficiency are achieved through real-time usage data and predictive algorithms that determine the correct amount of resources needed at the pod level at the right time. The platform is \"fully context-aware,\" automatically identifying whether a workload involves a MySQL database, a stateless HTTP server, or a critical Kafka broker, and incorporating this information into scaling decisions, Baron said.\nWith ScaleOps, cluster state is monitored continuously. If a pod is scheduled on a node with noisy neighbors that impact performance or health checks, it's automatically migrated to a more suitable node with greater available resources.\nRecognizing that a WordPress website, a Kafka broker, a MySQL database, and an Airflow pipeline have different availability requirements and criticality levels, each workload is treated uniquely. Resource allocation and scaling decisions are adjusted dynamically to meet these needs.\nThe platform also responds in real time to changes within the cluster, supporting auto-healing and adjusting to usage spikes.\nIn practice, developers no longer have to worry about operational responsibilities, like cost tracking and resource allocation, and have more time to code and engineer software to solve business needs more directly. Operations teams are no longer perceived as blockers to software development and deployment by imposing rigid constraints that stifle agility. They also do not have to worry as much about overprovisioning and overpaying for redundant resources to account for spikes in future demand by the developers, which CTOs and -- especially -- CFOs do not appreciate amid rising cloud costs.\nThe platform serves developers by automating resource allocation and requests. Instead of developers handling these tasks manually, the platform introduces an infrastructure layer that takes care of them. At the same time, it gives developers visibility and insight into how their workloads and resources are being utilized in production, Baron said. \"Ultimately, it's about finding a balance -- automating repetitive tasks while keeping developers informed and empowered.\"\n## Taking ScaleOps Out for a Ride\nScaleOps has a [free trial option](https://scaleops.com/), which is a good platform to get started, because the playground offers an immediate way to link ScaleOps directly to your cluster. For example, I easily attached ScaleOps to Helm, and then ScaleOps began seeking the cluster to manage.\nThe interface itself is very straightforward, allowing you to easily navigate between different time periods -- whether it's 70 days, 30 days, etc. -- in a time series graph that shows CPU usage and memory over time. Metrics such as optimized requests, usage and waste are among the key indicators displayed in the time series graph.\nFor more detailed analysis, each workload offers a range of functionalities and data analysis that is both straightforward and accessible. This includes cost savings achieved for each workload. It's also possible to change policies -- whether it's batch, cost, high availability, production or others -- meaning the system offers leeway to dynamically change or update policy on an as-needed basis.\nFor a positive developer experience, the platform was designed to automate the mundane and dynamic aspects of resource allocation and scaling while keeping developers \"in the loop,\" garnering insights into how their workloads and resources are performing in production, Baron said.\nThe platform serves developers by automating resource allocation and requests.

    "title": "To SQL or Not To SQL: That Is Not the Question",
    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "The ongoing debate between [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) and NoSQL is as old as relational database systems. Ever since [Edgar F. Codd introduced](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-databases/) the relational database concept in 1970, there has been an ongoing deep tension between structure and flexibility in database systems.\nSQL databases claim superiority through decades of proven reliability, strong [ACID](https://thenewstack.io/can-nosql-databases-be-acid-compliant/) guarantees and powerful query capabilities ideal for complex, relational data models. In contrast, proponents of NoSQL databases argue that rigid schemas can't keep pace with modern development, so they offer schema flexibility, simple application development and better performance for high-velocity or unstructured data.\nEach camp claims dominance -- SQL for consistency and integrity, NoSQL for speed and agility -- yet the real-world trend is convergence, as both camps increasingly work on borrowing features from the other.\n## SQL and NoSQL: Converging Into Multimodel Databases\nMultimodel databases like MySQL, [PostgreSQL](https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba) and Oracle are at the forefront of integrating non-relational capabilities into traditionally relational systems. Recent innovations include vector processing, document store features and support for collections of JSON documents. These new capabilities allow developers to:\n  * Work with JSON documents using familiar document APIs\n  * Query and process both structured and semistructured data using SQL\n  * Combine relational normalization with document-centric development\n\n\n## Multimodel Databases Support Native Document Store APIs\nAll these multimodel databases have introduced a binary format for storing JSON data natively and optimized. This includes Oracle's OSON format, which has shown advantages over BSON in [research](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3059-liu.pdf) for performance and efficiency of incremental updates.\nFor developers seeking a document-first experience, vendors offer APIs that expose native JSON stores, such as MySQL's X DevAPI, PostgreSQL-based FerretDB or Oracle's Database API for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/?utm_content=inline+mention). These APIs provide the simplicity of NoSQL development on top of relational infrastructure. Developers enjoy the simplicity and agility of schema-flexible development without needing a special-purpose document store database.\nHowever, unlike SQL, document store APIs are not standardized and remain vendor specific. Efforts to define a common standard are underway but are still in the early stages.\n## Querying JSON With SQL\nWith native JSON support, developers can treat document collections as first-class citizens in the database. Using ANSI SQL/JSON (introduced in SQL:2016), you can extract values, unnest arrays, filter documents and apply SQL functions to JSON content. This bridges relational and semistructured data through a unified language, opening the door to benefit from the [power of SQL](https://thenewstack.io/3-foundational-principles-for-writing-efficient-sql) for analytics and reporting.\nHere's an example that queries a JSON collection of movies, extracts attributes, aggregates gross revenue by year and calculates each year's revenue share:  \n\n```\nWITH revenue AS (\n\n   SELECT   \n\n      m.data.year\n\n      , round(sum(JSON_VALUE(data,'$.gross' RETURNING NUMBER NULL ON ERROR NULL ON EMPTY ))/1000000) as millions\n\n   FROM movies m \n\n   WHERE m.data.gross IS NOT NULL \n\n   GROUP BY m.data.year\n\n)\n\nSELECT year\n\n       , millions \n\n       , ROUND((RATIO_TO_REPORT(millions) OVER ())*100,2) pct_revenue\n\nFROM revenue r\n\nWHERE year > 2000\n\nORDER BY year DESC;\n```\n\n  \nThis example uses both the ANSI SQL/JSON operator `JSON_VALUE` and Oracle's simplified dot notation, a straightforward SQL-style way to extract JSON scalar values from a JSON document (`m.data.year`).\nDevelopers extract and \"relationalize\" attributes stored in JSON documents, join this information with relational tables, and use nested subqueries or other constructs -- the same way they use any available SQL operator or function for relational objects.\n## Exposing Relational Data as JSON Documents\nConversely, relational data can be exposed as JSON documents using JSON collection views, making it accessible to document-centric applications. The following example creates a JSON collection view on top of Oracle's EMP table, probably one of the first relational tables ever created for demonstration purposes:  \n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE JSON COLLECTION VIEW emp_collection AS\n\n   SELECT\n\n      JSON{'_id' : empno,\n\n           'employeName' : ename,\n\n           'jobRole' : job}\n\n     FROM emp;\n```\n\n  \nUsing this collection view through a document store API would return data similar to:  \n\n```\njason> db.emp_collection.findOne()\n\n{ _id: 7369, employeName: 'SMITH', jobRole: 'CLERK' }\n```\n\n  \nThis bidirectional flexibility blurs the boundaries between SQL and NoSQL and decouples how data is processed from how it is stored.\n## Beyond Dual Access: JSON-Relational Duality\nWhile native binary JSON storage, document APIs and SQL/JSON functionality represent strong progress, [JSON-relational duality](https://www.oracle.com/database/json-relational-duality/?source=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_A&SC=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_A&pcode=) takes things a step further. This new capability offers the best of both relational and JSON documents without the trade-offs of either model.\nIn short, duality views store the JSON documents internally in a highly efficient normalized format, using relational and JSON constructs. At the same time, developers interact with JSON documents.\nDuality views: stored as rows, exposed as documents\nWhether the application uses REST or document-centric APIs, developers benefit from the simplicity of retrieving and working with all the data needed for a single application-tier object: the JSON document. Creating a JSON duality view is pretty straightforward. Like a JSON collection view, developers define the Object Document Model for the business object as metadata in the database.\nHere's a simple example that defines a duality view to model a conference schedule using [GraphQL](https://roadmap.sh/graphql). The schedule object is comprised of:\n  * The attendee information\n  * The schedule for an individual attendee\n  * The schedule representation for one or more sessions that an attendee is planning to attend\n  * The detailed information about a session, including the speaker information\n\n\n```\ncreate or replace JSON Duality view ScheduleV \n\nAS \n\nattendee  \n\n{ _id : aid name : aname \n\n  schedule : schedule @insert @update @delete \n\n       { scheduleId : schedule_id \n\n         sessions @unnest \n\n                   { sessionId : sid \n\n                     name : name \n\n                     location : room \n\n                     speaker @unnest \n\n                              { speakerId : sid \n\n                                speaker : name \n\n                                } \n\n                        }  \n\n            } \n\n} ;\n```\n\n  \nJSON-relational duality, therefore, provides the storage, consistency and [efficiency benefits](https://thenewstack.io/3-sql-writing-tips-and-tricks-to-enhance-productivity) of the relational model while applications retrieve and manipulate deeply nested JSON structures.\n## The Best of Both Worlds\nThe convergence of SQL and NoSQL enables developers to benefit from the simplicity of JSON document development and the power of relational databases with a single database. Multimodel databases eliminate the need to choose one paradigm over another, taking over the single-purpose NoSQL database systems market. Developers don't have to face the choice between SQL and NoSQL systems and lock themselves into one programming paradigm. They enjoy the flexibility and freedom to pick the best approach for individual applications without sacrificing functionality.\nOracle's JSON-relational duality views go beyond coexistence by fusing the strengths of relational and document models into a unified architecture. As multimodel systems continue to evolve, this approach sets a compelling precedent -- and others are likely to follow.\n_Begin innovating today with[JSON-relational duality](https://www.oracle.com/database/json-relational-duality/?source=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_B&SC=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_B&pcode=), either locally with [Oracle Database 23ai Free](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/?source=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_C&SC=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_C&pcode=) or in the cloud on OCI with [Oracle Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/free-trial/?source=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_D&SC=:ex:pw:::::TNS_ToSQL_April25_D&pcode=)._\nThe post [To SQL or Not To SQL: That Is Not the Question](https://thenewstack.io/to-sql-or-not-to-sql-that-is-not-the-question/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "LAS VEGAS -- ServiceNow is on a bit of an acquisition spree. After announcing its intention to buy the agentic AI startup Moveworks for $2.85 billion last month, today, at its Knowledge 2025 conference, the company announced that it also plans to acquire [data catalog](https://thenewstack.io/data-catalogs-need-a-major-upgrade/) platform [data.world](https://data.world/).\nServiceNow expects the acquisition to close sometime in the summer.\n\"The path that goes to that agentic AI heaven often goes through data hell,\" ServiceNow SVP and GM [Gaurav Rewari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grewari/) told me.\nIn a recent report, Gartner said that only [4% of enterprise leaders](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-02-26-lack-of-ai-ready-data-puts-ai-projects-at-risk) think their data is [AI ready](https://thenewstack.io/three-essential-roi-goals-for-agentic-ai-applications/) and that 60% of AI projects will fail because of this.\n\"It's not sufficient to just have this agentic AI layer and orchestration, etc. We've got to help [our customers] with the plumbing underneath,\" Rewari explained.\nIn his view, to do that, ServiceNow -- and really any similar platform -- needs three pieces: a performant and scalable database (for Service Now, that's its Postgres fork [RaptorDB](https://www.servicenow.com/products/raptordb.html)), because as agents proliferate, they will stress those systems beyond today's needs. The ability for agents to access data beyond a single company's silos; and tools to ensure the quality of that data and governance tools to manage it.\n\"[The data.world acquisition] gives  us a data catalog and data governance solution that is built on a knowledge graph,\" Rewari explained. \"That last piece is crucial, because ServiceNow's core architectural principle, embodied in the [configuration management database], etc., is this notion of a semantic layer or a knowledge graph. Data.world, from day one, has differentiated itself from the other catalog vendors by being one that is built on a knowledge graph.\"\nThis knowledge graph, he argued, provides the company's agents with more context, which in turn will also help it enrich its analytics tools because with this context, it can suggest more logical drill paths to its users. But most importantly, Rewari explained, ServiceNow believes that this will allow it to, in the long run, bring together transactional and analytical processing.\n\"The reason AI is so profoundly relevant to that undertaking is that AI agents are not just decision support or BI things. They will actually take action for you and we can be smack in the middle of that,\" he said.\nAs is so often the case, ServiceNow decided to acquire data.world instead of building its own version of this data catalog platform because it wanted to move faster. Since data.world is built around a knowledge graph, its core architecture was already well aligned with the ServiceNow Platform.\n\"I felt that under the circumstance, time to market and time to be able to build all the additional things you want to build on top of it, convinced me that this would be the right company to buy.\"\nThe post [ServiceNow Acquires Data.World To Expand Its AI Data Strategy](https://thenewstack.io/servicenow-acquires-data-world-to-expand-its-ai-data-strategy/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

AdaCore, a provider of high-integrity systems development tools, offers an interesting perspective on this industry-wide challenge.\n## The Legacy Software Dilemma\n\"Legacy software is hard,\" Aiello told The New Stack frankly. \"It's been a hard problem for a long time.\"\nThe difficulty is apparent in the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA)](https://www.darpa.mil/) ongoing efforts to tackle software correctness and memory safety. While many proposed solutions work well for new development, they often falter when applied to existing systems. [DARPA's recent \"Tractor\" initiative](https://thenewstack.io/can-darpas-tractor-pull-c-to-rust-for-memory-safe-overhaul/), which aims to develop automated tools to rewrite C code in [Rust](https://thenewstack.io/rust-programming-language-guide/), underscores just how challenging the legacy code problem remains.\n## CHERI: A Runtime Solution for Legacy Code\nFor organizations unable to rewrite their legacy C/C++ codebases, AdaCore is working with an emerging hardware-based solution called [CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions)](https://www.adacore.com/search/results?q=cheri).\n\"We are working on developing a tool chain on top of a new kind of hardware which is called CHERI, which basically allows you to detect and add information to that hardware so that it can automatically detect some potential or some actual memory safety problems,\" Ruiz explained.\nWhat makes CHERI particularly valuable for legacy systems is that it doesn't require rewriting code -- only recompiling it. The technology provides specialized hardware instructions that check memory safety at runtime, halting the program if violations occur, he said.\nAlthough CHERI hardware is still \"quasi-experimental\" according to Ruiz, AdaCore provides an emulator that allows developers to recompile their legacy software and detect memory vulnerabilities without requiring actual CHERI hardware. This approach is particularly useful in testing scenarios, such as [fuzzing](https://thenewstack.io/api-fuzzing-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-use-it/) campaigns to detect memory safety issues.\n\"CHERI will keep you safe effectively by halting the program if it does the wrong thing,\" Aiello said. \"It's protecting you in the sense that it provides confidentiality and integrity at the expense of availability, because it's going to kill off the software if the software does something wrong.\"\n## Strategic Rewrites With Spark and Rust\nFor critical components where program termination isn't an acceptable outcome, AdaCore recommends targeted rewrites of the most critical code sections using memory-safe languages like [Spark](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark) (a dialect of the [Ada](https://www.adacore.com/about-ada) programming language) or Rust.\nAiello pointed to NVIDIA as an example: \"NVIDIA was initially very concerned about some security properties of their firmware and chose to rewrite portions of the firmware that had previously been written in C in Spark, and prove correctness of safety properties while they did this rewrite.\"\nTo support this approach, AdaCore provides toolchains for [C/C++](https://thenewstack.io/out-with-c-and-c-in-with-memory-safety/), Rust, and Spark that work well together, enabling organizations to gradually improve security in their most critical components while maintaining their existing codebase, Aiello said.\n## Spark: Formal Verification for Critical Systems\nWhen discussing alternatives to C/C++, Aiello highlighted Spark, a dialect of Ada that enables formal verification - a powerful capability for security-critical applications.\n\"Spark permits you to do functional verification using formal proof,\" Aiello explained. \"For a given function in your software, you state preconditions, constraints on the inputs to the function, and then you state the expected output of the function. Spark will prove automatically that the implementation makes the post-condition true when the precondition holds.\"\nThis capability is particularly valuable for security because Spark automatically proves that code doesn't have runtime errors -- including memory safety issues. While Ada provides runtime checking of range values and memory access, Spark can statically prove at design time that none of these checks will fail, allowing developers to disable them for performance without sacrificing safety.\n## The Rust Appeal: Why Organizations Are Looking Beyond C/C++\nWhile AdaCore has deep roots in Ada and Spark, they're also embracing Rust as part of their solution portfolio. Aiello identified three key factors driving Rust's popularity:\n  1. **Memory safety** : Rust's ownership model prevents memory safety issues at compile time\n  2. **Growing talent pool** : Unlike Ada, companies can find developers who already know Rust\n  3. **Rich ecosystem** : Rust's extensive library of third-party \"crates\" accelerates development\n\n\n\"The excitement behind Rust means that there are a lot of people, a growing number of people, who know Rust and who really want to use it in their professional career,\" noted Aiello. \"There's a lot of grassroots that I've been hearing about at basically every company you can think of where engineers are agitating for the use of Rust.\"\n## The Future: AI + Formal Methods\nLooking ahead, Aiello said he sees potential in combining [generative AI](https://thenewstack.io/generative-ai-in-2023-genai-tools-became-table-stakes/) with formal methods like Spark to accelerate secure software development. While acknowledging that AI-generated code can contain errors, he suggests that formal verification could provide a powerful safety net.\n\"You could provide requirements for your software, maybe write some preconditions and post-conditions, some contracts that state formally what you want your software to do and then push a button and have a generative system implement it for you, and then run Spark and prove that the implementation matches the contracts,\" Aiello said.\nThis approach would maintain human creativity for architecture and design while delegating implementation details to AI systems, with formal verification ensuring correctness, he noted.\n## A Multitiered Response\nAs organizations face growing pressure to address memory safety, AdaCore's approach offers a realistic pathway forward. Rather than demanding complete rewrites of legacy systems, they propose a combination of strategies:\n  * Using CHERI hardware/emulation to detect memory safety issues in existing code.\n  * Strategically rewriting critical components in memory-safe languages like Spark or Rust.\n  * Employing formal verification to mathematically prove the absence of memory safety issues.\n\n\nThis pragmatic, multilayered approach acknowledges both the business reality of legacy code and the critical importance of improving security -- offering a blueprint for organizations navigating the complex transition away from C/C++.\nThe post [CHERI on Top: AdaCore's Hardware 'Fix' for Legacy C/C++ Code](https://thenewstack.io/cheri-on-top-adacores-hardware-fix-for-legacy-c-c-code/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "The client-server model is so deeply ingrained in traditional software development that we rarely challenge the dogma. However, edge computing, once consisting only of CDN acceleration and DDoS prevention, has emerged as a third tier of computing.\nWe are witnessing a transformation in edge computing as more powerful runtimes like WebAssembly enable developers to build entire applications at the distributed edge instead of in cloud services.\nWhat if your app could run in 50 cities simultaneously and without traditional servers? That's the promise of edge native development, powered by WebAssembly.\n## **What Is Edge Computing and Why It Matters for WebAssembly**\nThe client-server model is the classic architecture upon which the Internet was built. Our common online tasks -- email, web, messaging, and so on -- were all initially conceptualized in that two-part model, in which a user has a client that presents data, but the data itself is managed by (and stored on) servers.\nIn the late 1990s, a third tier quietly inserted itself between clients and servers. At the time, we called it the Content Delivery Network (CDN). Its initial job was to store static assets, like images and stylesheets, closer to the user. A typical CDN might have dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of [Points of Presence (POPs)](https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/) located around the globe. And these small banks of computing and storage power interceded in webpage loads to deliver assets faster. CDN was about improving delivery speed, but only for the assets that do not frequently change.\nCDN networks proved good places to run other kinds of operations as well. Over time, CDNs expanded into the security world and became edge providers. For example, their distributed nature meant they could stop Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks before attackers could take down the upstream servers.\nAs [cloud providers dethroned on-premise data](https://thenewstack.io/the-architects-guide-to-the-modern-data-stack/) centers, edge providers made gentle forays into hosting compute. By providing simple JavaScript engines embedded in CDN locations, edge companies let customers do lightweight transformations on inbound HTTP requests. Edge compute was used to do things like:\n  * Issue redirects when the content was relocated\n  * Manage CORS headers in HTTP requests\n  * Intelligently route traffic based on location information\n\n\nDevelopers loved the model, but the system's constraints meant only a certain amount of processing could be done at the edge. This opened a new opportunity.\n### **How Edge Computing Evolved to Support WebAssembly**\nEarly edge computing -- running small JavaScript snippets to alter HTTP requests -- is essentially an assistive function. The code executed at the edge was not designed to do any heavy work or return complete results to the user. It was designed to make small decisions to streamline how the upstream servers would handle the request, or to offload some work from the upstream servers by making decisions early. For example, performing authentication at the edge is a small task, but one that (for failed authentication attempts) can offload work from busier and expensive upstream servers.\nHowever, two things held back edge computing. The first was the low amount of [computing power available to edge](https://thenewstack.io/vmware-discloses-its-edge-computing-future/) workers. The second was the dearth of data services running at the edge. It's hard to do any significant computing when there is no place to store data.\n## **WebAssembly: Solving Edge Runtime Challenges**\nIf low compute power is the first problem, then there are two potential solutions: increase the power of the available edge hardware or make the runtimes more efficient. Expanding hardware is necessary anyway, but it tends to move slowly because it is so expensive. While over the long term, edge locations may gain better hardware, in the short term, this solution is untenable.\nBut the emergence of a faster class of runtimes has changed the game. Fastly was the first to use WebAssembly as an edge runtime with its [Compute@Edge](https://docs.fastly.com/products/compute) platform. Akamai and Fermyon have joined forces to [provide a WebAssembly-powered runtime](https://thenewstack.io/should-you-care-about-fermyon-wasm-functions-on-akamai/) as powerful as Amazon's Lambda serverless environment, but running on Akamai's core edge regions. Both Fastly and Akamai now support small snippets of JavaScript code and an increasing portfolio of other programming languages, all running as WebAssembly binaries. Even Cloudflare, a staunch JavaScript advocate, has made forays into multi-language support [backed by WebAssembly](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/).\nWebAssembly has four virtues when it comes to edge computing:\n  1. It's secure by default, and is multitenant safe.\n  2. WebAssembly binaries are small, especially in comparison to [containers and virtual machines](https://thenewstack.io/containers-vs-virtual-machines-another-perspective/) (the technologies behind first-generation serverless).\n  3. Programs compiled to WebAssembly can run on just about any hardware and operating system without alteration.\n  4. Cold starting WebAssembly is extraordinarily fast, making it both high-performance and highly scalable.\n\n\nWebAssembly, a secure and platform-neutral runtime, is opening up the possibility of sophisticated edge computing that may completely replace the server component, in some cases. In addition to accommodating all of the early edge computing use cases, it is robust enough to run distributed content management systems, digital experiences platforms, and AI inferencing without needing upstream support from a cloud provider.\nInstead of one centralized bank of compute running in a cloud region, WebAssembly distributed along the edge means tens of thousands of instances of the same application can run spread across the globe, answering requests with jaw-dropping speed. If cloud native computing defines the movement to the cloud, then this emerging trend is aptly named edge native computing.\n### **Why Distributed Storage Is Critical for WebAssembly at the Edge**\nThe second requirement of edge native [computing is the need for distributed storage](https://thenewstack.io/what-are-time-series-databases-and-why-do-you-need-them/) that is easily accessible from edge functions.\nCloudflare led the way, introducing distributed key/value storage, object storage, and database storage a few years ago. Akamai acquired Linode, which supplied hefty cloud computing capabilities (which Akamai proceeded to roll toward the edge) and cloud-grade storage. And a host of third parties, including [Harper](https://www.harperdb.io/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/), and [Turso](https://turso.tech/), have introduced edge native SQL databases that solve the data access problems associated with distributed computing. In March of this year, the new [Graft database](https://sqlsync.dev/posts/stop-syncing-everything/) announced a synchronization mechanism ideally suited for serverless workloads at the edge.\n## **The Rise of Edge Native Applications Powered by WebAssembly**\nCombining data access at the edge with the massive improvements in edge computing runtimes, [developers can now build applications](https://thenewstack.io/google-wants-developers-to-build-on-device-ai-applications/) that run distributed along the edge and have little or no reliance on upstream in-datacenter servers. The older client/server model gave way to a client/edge/server model, which has now opened the potential for a distributed client/edge model.\nThis new edge native approach will not only make distributed computing easy but also be a home base for the emerging inferencing-based AI applications (including agentic workflows). By bringing work closer to the end user, edge applications not only meet speed requirements but also localize information and abide by data sovereignty requirements. All of this will be powered by WebAssembly.\n* * *\n_The owner of TNS, Insight Partners, also invests in Fermyon. As a result, Fermyon receives preference as a contributor._\nThe post [Build Edge Native Apps With WebAssembly](https://thenewstack.io/build-edge-native-apps-with-webassembly/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "Interest in Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers/) is as high as confusion about what it is and why you should use it. In part 1 of this series, I dove [deep into MCP](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-mcp-game-changer-or-just-more-hype) -- what it is, and what it isn't. In this article, I'll take a look at the main reason there's so much buzz around it: enabling agentic AI workflows.\n## MCP for Agentic Workflows\nA raw [large language model (LLM)](https://thenewstack.io/category/llm/) simply maps inputs to outputs. An agentic LLM system gives the LLM:\n  * Tools to act\n  * A memory of past steps\n  * A way to loop and reason iteratively\n  * Optional goals or tasks\n\n\nTherefore, when you hook an LLM up with tools, let it decide what tools to call, let it reflect on outcomes and let it plan next steps -- you've made it agentic. It can now decide what to do next without being told every step.\nSo what does this have to do with MCP? Well, as we mentioned, MCP can provide context beyond just tools. MCP servers can also provide parameterized prompts that effectively allow the MCP server to provide the next instruction to the LLM. This prompt chaining can open some very interesting doors.\nWhat's even more compelling is how MCP can surface related tools at the right time, without needing to cram every option into the prompt context. Rather than over-engineering prompt descriptions to account for every possibility and force the LLM into a deterministic workflow, MCP allows a more modular approach: \"Here's the response from this tool call, and here are some tools that might help if this gets more complex.\" This makes the system more adaptive and scalable while still giving the LLM the flexibility to explore new paths if the initial instruction isn't fully deterministic.\nIn fact, with these capabilities, we have something resembling an agent that emerges from the interplay among:\n  * LLMs (reasoning and deciding)\n  * MCP servers (offering tools and chaining prompts)\n  * MCP clients (managing the loop and execution)\n  * Users (providing the goal)\n\n\nLet's take a look at this in action. I'll demonstrate a very simple agentic workflow where an LLM invokes tools from multiple MCP servers based on returned prompts. Here are the servers I'm working with:\n**Todo List MCP Server**  \n\n```\n[[tool]]\nname = \"add_task\"\ndescription = \"Adds a new task to your todo list.\"\ninput_parameters = [\n  { name = \"task_description\", type = \"string\", description = \"The task to add to your todo list.\" }\n]\n\n[[prompt]]\nname = \"plan_daily_tasks\"\ndescription = \"Plans the day by breaking down a user goal into actionable tasks.\"\ninput_parameters = [\n  { name = \"user_goal\", type = \"string\", description = \"The user's goal for the day.\" }\n]\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nBased on the user's goal: '{user_goal}', generate 2-3 specific, actionable tasks that would help the user achieve it.\nFor each task, call the `add_task` tool with a helpful task description.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n  \n**Calendar MCP Server**  \n\n```\n[[tool]]\nname = \"schedule_event\"\ndescription = \"Schedules an event in your calendar.\"\ninput_parameters = [\n  { name = \"task_description\", type = \"string\", description = \"The task or event to be scheduled.\" },\n  { name = \"time\", type = \"string\", description = \"The time when the event should be scheduled (e.g., '2pm today').\" }\n]\n\n[[prompt]]\nname = \"schedule_todo_task\"\ndescription = \"Schedules a task from the todo list into your calendar.\"\ninput_parameters = [\n  { name = \"task_description\", type = \"string\", description = \"The task to schedule.\" }\n]\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nThe user wants to schedule the task: '{task_description}'.\nSuggest a good time for today and call the `schedule_event` tool to add it to the calendar.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n  \nOK, so now imagine you have a chatbot with access to the context provided by these MCP servers. When a user provides a high-level goal like, \"I want to focus on deep work today,\" the MCP client coordinates a modular, multiserver workflow to fulfill the request. It packages the user message, along with tool metadata and prompt instructions from all connected MCP servers, and sends it to the LLM. The LLM first selects a high-level planning tool `plan_daily_tasks` from the Todo Server, which returns a prompt directing the LLM to break down the goal into actionable tasks using `add_task`.\nAs tasks are created and the LLM is notified, the LLM reasons further and decides to schedule the tasks by invoking `schedule_todo_task`, triggering the Calendar Server. That server responds with new prompt guidance to use `schedule_event`, at which point the LLM finalizes the day's plan with specific times.\nEach tool interaction is routed and mediated by the MCP client, which manages the reasoning loop, coordinates tool execution and tracks interaction state across the session. This forms a fully agentic workflow: the user **sets the goal** , the LLM **reasons and decides** , the MCP servers **expose tools and dynamic prompts**  and the MCP client **orchestrates the process** , enabling intelligent, composable automation across domains.\nFrom a very basic and high-level prompt, you now have an agent that makes several decisions on its own to reach an end goal. Of course, there is little value in generating these tasks without knowing more about what the user wants to focus their deep work on, but improving this simply requires modifying the MCP server to have a more comprehensive and well-thought-out prompt.\n## MCP Nesting\nThings start becoming really interesting when you start to look beyond a single layer of MCP clients and servers. MCP servers can also be clients to other MCP servers. This nesting enables modularity, composition and agent-like delegation, where one server can \"delegate\" part of its reasoning or functionality to another.\nIt's like [microservices](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/) for agents. Just as we moved from [monoliths to microservices](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/microservices-vs-monoliths-an-operational-comparison/) for backend applications, we're now decoupling tool logic from the agent runtime using MCP servers. Based on the rapid addition of new MCP servers, it's easy to imagine a vast and highly composable system of tooling that can be used like LEGO bricks to build out comprehensive workflows.\nFor example, you could have a `dev-scaffolding` MCP server that acts as a high-level orchestrator that focuses on helping devs go from ideas to working code by coordinating several specialized, upstream MCP servers. When a user requests a new app feature (e.g., \"Add a login feature\"), the orchestrator server uses upstream servers -- `spec-writer` to generate an API spec, `code-gen` to scaffold code from that spec and `test-writer` to produce corresponding test cases.\nThese collective MCP servers could also be used for environment-specific functionality. In other words, they expose the same interface (e.g., `query_database`) but are configured for different environments. This would allow you to have a `dev-app-server` that includes upstream MCP servers like a `dev-db-server` using a SQlite database, a `dev-auth-server` that returns mocked auth responses and a `dev-deploy-server` that wraps a local command-line interface (CLI) tool. Then the `prod-app-server` would point to correlated upstream servers tied to cloud-based deployments.\nPlatforms like mcp.run have already heavily leveraged this composability. Mcp.run allows you to install an extensible, dynamically updateable server that leverages an upstream registry of MCP servers it calls servlets. These servlets do not _need_ to be installed locally but can run remotely on the mcp.run infrastructure.\nThis is quite powerful for a number of reasons, but for the purposes of this article, it highlights an important shift that is taking place in the MCP ecosystem: remote MCP servers. That's the topic of my third and final article in this series.\n_Want to learn more?

The first of these top-level projects are [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/) and [DeepSpeed](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/usage_guides/deepspeed).\nVirtual Large Language Model (vLLM) is an open source library focused on making large language model ([LLM](https://thenewstack.io/the-new-shadow-it-llms-in-the-wild/)) inference and serving significantly faster and more efficiently. Originally developed at University of California Berkeley, vLLM is designed to address the speed and memory challenges of running large AI models in production environments.\n## PagedAttention Algorithm\nVLLM's most interesting feature, to me at least, is [PagedAttention Algorithm](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/pagedattention). Inspired by virtual memory in operating systems, PagedAttention optimizes memory usage by managing attention keys and values in non-contiguous blocks, reducing memory waste and enabling larger batch sizes.\nIn a statement, [Simon Mo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-mo-834217162), Project Co-Lead at vLLM, said, \"We're excited that vLLM is one of the first Platform Projects joining the PyTorch Foundation. VLLM is built on top of PyTorch with deep integration, such as Torch Compile and multi-hardware support. We look forward to further collaborating with the ecosystem that powers innovations in open source and vendor-neutral technologies for AI.\"\nDeepSpeed is a distributed training library that simplifies scaling AI workloads. It does this by providing optimization techniques such as [Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/zero/), 3D parallelism, and inference acceleration, enabling the efficient training of extremely large models. It is widely used in both academic research and production environments.\nLike vLLM, DeepSpeed has its roots in PyTorch. As [Olatunji Ruwase](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/olruwase/), DeepSpeed's Project Lead, said in a statement, He's \"delighted to become a hosted Platform project in the PyTorch Foundation. \"From inception, DeepSpeed has built on PyTorch, with critical dependencies on features such as Module, Tensor, Distributed, and Compiler. We are eager to leverage this closer integration with the PyTorch ecosystem to achieve our goal of providing open and democratized access to state-of-the-art AI technologies for all.\"\n## Platforms and Verticals\nLooking ahead, under its new umbrella structure, the PyTorch Foundation will oversee two categories of projects. The first is platform projects. These are domain-agnostic programs support the entire AI lifecycle, including training, inference, model optimization, deployment, and agentic systems. The other, vertical projects, as the name suggests, are tools tailored for specific industries and applications, such as bioinformatics, geospatial intelligence, and protein folding.\nProjects accepted into the foundation benefit from vendor-neutral governance, strategic support, increased visibility, and access to a global community of contributors. The foundation distinguishes between \"ecosystem projects,\" which remain independently governed, and \"foundation-hosted projects,\" which adopt the foundation's open governance model and receive comprehensive operational support. Both vLLM and DeepSpeed are foundation-hosted projects.\n## Opening the Umbrella\nSince its [inception at the Linux Foundation two and a half years ago, the PyTorch Foundation](https://thenewstack.io/pytorch-takes-ai-ml-back-to-its-research-open-source-roots/) has grown to include over 30 member organizations and 120 ecosystem projects. These newest moves are a natural evolution of its rapid growth and global momentum.\n\"This is an exciting new chapter for the PyTorch Foundation and the broader open source AI ecosystem,\" said [Matt White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdwdata/), the PyTorch Foundation's Executive Director. \"By transitioning to an umbrella foundation, we're not only formalizing the momentum we've built across the PyTorch ecosystem; we're creating space for new projects and innovators to thrive within a vendor-neutral, open governance environment.\"\nFor more information on joining the PyTorch Foundation or submitting a project, visit the official website and stay tuned for further updates and opportunities to participate.\nThe post [PyTorch Foundation Welcomes vLLM and DeepSpeed as Hosted Projects](https://thenewstack.io/pytorch-foundation-welcomes-vllm-and-deepspeed-as-hosted-projects/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "Building robust, scalable applications in [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) often requires fine-tuned automation -- and that's where [Kubernetes operators](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-operators-the-real-reason-your-boss-is-smiling/) come into play. Operators extend Kubernetes' capabilities by automating management of custom resources and stateful applications. Think of operators as software that knows how to operate your apps, ensuring everything runs smoothly, even in complex environments.\nI will guide you through the steps of creating a Kubernetes operator from scratch, a crucial skill for anyone working in modern cloud native ecosystems. We'll walk through building a \"self-healing diagnostics\" operator, designed to boost [observability](https://thenewstack.io/observability/) in Kubernetes clusters. With this operator, crash information is automatically annotated to pods, and remediation actions can be applied on demand.\n## Why Is This Important to You?\nFor anyone managing Kubernetes clusters, operators streamline workflows, reduce manual intervention and allow proactive infrastructure management.\nThis tutorial cuts through the theory and gives you practical, real-world experience, covering:\n  1. **Full local workflow:** Learn how to run and test everything locally using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), a tool for testing Kubernetes locally, and container manager Docker.\n  2. **Real-world operator patterns:** You'll create Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), implement reconciliation loops and leverage the Kubernetes client API.\n  3. **Immediate feedback:** You'll then test your operator and watch it automatically annotate crash information to pods in real time.\n\n\nMastering Kubernetes operators sets you up to manage complex systems with precision and scalability. Ready to level up?

It works by doing the following:\n  * It defines custom resources (i.e., CRDs) that represent your application's desired state.\n  * It implements controllers that continuously reconcile the actual state with the desired state.\n\n\nThink of operators as automated domain experts that can monitor your application's health, react to changes or problems, and apply specialized knowledge to fix issues.\n### **The Reconciliation Loop**\nThe heart of the operator is the reconciliation loop! Think of it as Kubernetes' way of constantly moving from the current state to the desired state.  \n\n```\n┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐\n│  Observed   │            │   Desired   │\n│    State    │─────────►  │    State    │\n└─────────────┘            └─────────────┘\n       ▲                          │\n       │                          │\n       │                          ▼\n       │                  ┌──────────────┐\n       └───────────────── │ Reconcile()  │\n                          └──────────────┘\n```\n\n  \nThe controller is triggered whenever a pod changes. Then it:\n  1. Checks if the pod matches any PodDiagnoser's target labels.\n  2. Examines container restart information.\n  3. Adds diagnostic annotations if crashes are detected.\n  4. Applies any configured remediation actions.\n\n\nThis cycle repeats continuously, ensuring your pods always have up-to-date diagnostic information!\n## **Building an Operator**\nNow let's create an operator that automatically diagnoses pod crashes.\n### **Initialize the Operator Project**\n```\n# Create a directory for your operator\nmkdir -p pod-diagnoser-operator\ncd pod-diagnoser-operator\n\n# Initialize a new project with kubebuilder\nkubebuilder init --domain=local.io --repo=local.io/pod-diagnoser\n\n# Create the API and controller\nkubebuilder create api --group=diagnostics --version=v1 --kind=PodDiagnoser --resource=true --controller=true\n```\n\n### **Define the CRD**\nEdit the generated `api/v1/poddiagnoser_types.go` file:  \n\n```\npackage v1\n\nimport (\n    metav1 \"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1\"\n)\n\n// PodDiagnoserSpec defines the desired state of PodDiagnoser\ntype PodDiagnoserSpec struct {\n    // TargetLabels specifies which pods to monitor based on labels\n    // +optional\n    TargetLabels map[string]string `json:\"targetLabels,omitempty\"`\n\n    // EnableAnnotations determines whether to add diagnostic annotations\n    // +optional\n    EnableAnnotations bool `json:\"enableAnnotations,omitempty\"`\n    \n    // RemediationAction specifies what action to take when crashes are detected\n    // +optional\n    RemediationAction string `json:\"remediationAction,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// PodDiagnoserStatus defines the observed state of PodDiagnoser\ntype PodDiagnoserStatus struct {\n    // LastProcessedPod is the last pod that was processed\n    // +optional\n    LastProcessedPod string `json:\"lastProcessedPod,omitempty\"`\n\n    // DiagnosedPods contains the count of pods that have been diagnosed\n    // +optional\n    DiagnosedPods int `json:\"diagnosedPods,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n//+kubebuilder:object:root=true\n//+kubebuilder:subresource:status\n\n// PodDiagnoser is the Schema for the poddiagnosers API\ntype PodDiagnoser struct {\n    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:\",inline\"`\n    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:\"metadata,omitempty\"`\n\n    Spec   PodDiagnoserSpec   `json:\"spec,omitempty\"`\n    Status PodDiagnoserStatus `json:\"status,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n//+kubebuilder:object:root=true\n\n// PodDiagnoserList contains a list of PodDiagnoser\ntype PodDiagnoserList struct {\n    metav1.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n    metav1.ListMeta `json:\"metadata,omitempty\"`\n    Items           []PodDiagnoser `json:\"items\"`\n}\n\nfunc init() {\n    SchemeBuilder.Register(&PodDiagnoser{}, &PodDiagnoserList{})\n}\n```\n\n  \nRun the following command to update the generated code:  \n\n```\nmake generate\n```\n\n### **Implement the Controller**\nEdit `internal/controller/poddiagnoser_controller.go`:  \n\n```\npackage controller\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"time\"\n\n    corev1 \"k8s.io/api/core/v1\"\n    \"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors\"\n    \"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime\"\n    \"k8s.io/client-go/tools/record\"\n    \"k8s.io/client-go/util/retry\"\n    ctrl \"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime\"\n    \"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client\"\n    \"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log\"\n\n    diagnosticsv1 \"local.io/pod-diagnoser/api/v1\"\n)\n\n// PodDiagnoserReconciler reconciles a PodDiagnoser object\ntype PodDiagnoserReconciler struct {\n    client.Client\n    Scheme *runtime.Scheme\n    Recorder record.EventRecorder // Add event recorder\n}\n\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=diagnostics.local.io,resources=poddiagnosers,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=diagnostics.local.io,resources=poddiagnosers/status,verbs=get;update;patch\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=diagnostics.local.io,resources=poddiagnosers/finalizers,verbs=update\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=\"\",resources=pods,verbs=get;list;watch;update;patch\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=\"\",resources=events,verbs=create;patch\n\n// Reconcile is part of the main kubernetes reconciliation loop\nfunc (r *PodDiagnoserReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {\n    logger := log.FromContext(ctx)\n    \n    // Get the pod that triggered reconciliation\n    pod := &corev1.Pod{}\n    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, pod);

Locate your operator's deployment YAML file, typically in `config/manager/manager.yaml`\n  2. Add `imagePullPolicy: Never` to the container spec:  \n```\nyaml\n\nCopy\n\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: manager\n        image: controller:latest\n        imagePullPolicy: Never  # Add this line\n```\n\n\n\n### **Build and Deploy the Operator**\n```\n# Build the operator image\nmake docker-build IMG=pod-diagnoser:latest\n\n# Load the image into the Kind cluster\nkind load docker-image pod-diagnoser:latest --name self-healing-lab\n\n# Install the CRDs\nmake install\n\n# Deploy the operator\nmake deploy IMG=pod-diagnoser:latest\n```\n\n  \nApply the RBAC permissions:  \n\n```\nkubectl apply -f operator-permissions.yaml\n```\n\n  \nCheck that the operator is running:  \n\n```\nkubectl get pods -n pod-diagnoser-operator-system\n```\n\n  \nIf the pod is having issues pulling the image, you might need to restart it:  \n\n```\nkubectl delete pod -n pod-diagnoser-operator-system \\\n  $(kubectl get pods -n pod-diagnoser-operator-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')\n```\n\n  \n**Security alert:** While using `cluster-admin` is convenient for experimentation, it grants excessive privileges. For production, always follow the principle of least privilege by creating custom roles with only the necessary permissions.\nIf you still see RBAC errors, you can temporarily grant broader permissions for development:  \n\n```\n# For development only - not recommended for production\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding pod-diagnoser-admin \\\n  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \\\n  --serviceaccount=pod-diagnoser-operator-system:pod-diagnoser-operator-controller-manager\n```\n\n### **Create a PodDiagnoser Instance**\nCreate a file named `config/samples/diagnostics_v1_poddiagnoser.yaml`:  \n\n```\napiVersion: diagnostics.local.io/v1\nkind: PodDiagnoser\nmetadata:\n  name: fragileapp-diagnoser\nspec:\n  targetLabels:\n    app: fragile-app\n  enableAnnotations: true\n  remediationAction: \"LogEvent\"\n```\n\n  \nApply it to your cluster:  \n\n```\nkubectl apply -f config/samples/diagnostics_v1_poddiagnoser.yaml\n```\n\n### **View Operator Logs**\nCheck the operator logs to see what's happening:  \n\n```\nPOD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n pod-diagnoser-operator-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')\nkubectl logs -n pod-diagnoser-operator-system $POD_NAME -c manager\n```\n\n### **Test the Operator**\nTrigger the fragile app to crash:  \n\n```\n# Port forward to the pod\nPOD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=fragile-app -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\nkubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:80\n```\n\n  \nIn another terminal, send requests to crash the app:  \n\n```\nfor i in {1..10}; do curl localhost:8080; echo; done\n```\n\n  \nWait for the pod to restart, then check if the operator added diagnostic annotations:  \n\n```\nkubectl get pod -l app=fragile-app -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.annotations}'\n```\n\n  \nYou should see annotations like:  \n\n```\n{\"diagnostics.local.io/restart-reason\":\"Completed (Exit Code: 0)\",\"diagnostics.local.io/restart-time\":\"2025-03-06T16:10:28Z\"}%\n```\n\n  \nAlso, check for the event recorded by the operator:  \n\n```\nkubectl get events | grep PodRestarted\n```\n\n  \nYou should see events like:  \n\n```\n56s         Warning   PodRestarted              pod/fragile-app-6488586b44-n7qg7      Pod fragile-app-6488586b44-n7qg7 restarted due to Completed (Exit Code: 0) (Exit Code: 0)\n```\n\n## **Clean Up**\nWhen you're done with the tutorial, it's time to clean up your resources:  \n\n```\n# Delete the test application\nkubectl delete -f fragile-app-deployment.yaml\n\n# Delete the PodDiagnoser custom resource\nkubectl delete -f config/samples/diagnostics_v1_poddiagnoser.yaml\n\n# Uninstall the operator and CRDs\nmake undeploy\nmake uninstall\n\n# Delete the cluster when you're done\nkind delete cluster --name self-healing-lab\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\nCongratulations! You've successfully built a Kubernetes operator that diagnoses pod crashes, applies remediation strategies and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes events for enhanced visibility. This achievement not only showcases your understanding of the operator pattern but also highlights your ability to extend Kubernetes with domain-specific automation and intelligence.\nBy leveraging the power of the operator, you've enriched Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities, creating a smarter, more efficient system that proactively addresses application failures with diagnostic insights.\nKey takeaways for future success:\n  * **CRDs:** You now know how to define schemas tailored to your application's needs!\n  * **Controllers and reconciliation:** You've mastered how to build the control loop that drives your operator.\n  * **Robust error handling:** You can now implement retry mechanisms, ensuring resilience in future operations.\n  * **RBAC and security:** You've scoped permissions, making your operator production-ready.\n\n\nThis project is a testament to what's possible when you pair Kubernetes' power with precise, purpose-built automation.

    "kind": "blog",
    "content": "At its [user conference](https://www.pulumi.com/pulumi-up/) today, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) introduced Pulumi IDP, an internal developer platform (IDP) designed to speed up cloud software delivery while embedding security and governance from the get-go.\nBuilt to run atop Pulumi's popular open source[ infrastructure as code (IaC) platform](https://www.pulumi.com/product/infrastructure-as-code/), the company claims that Pulumi IDP enables engineering teams to go from \"concept to cloud\" in merely a few minutes -- which can eliminate weeks or months of conventional overhead.\nThe platform addresses a rapidly expanding market segment -- one which includes Qovery, Terraform, Humanitec, OpsLevel, and Coherence. According to [Gartner](https://gartner.com), [80% of large enterprises](https://www.gartner.com/en/infrastructure-and-it-operations-leaders/topics/platform-engineering) are expected to deploy internal developer platforms within the next two years. Pulumi IDP addresses this trend by combining infrastructure-first principles with enterprise-grade controls, offering developers and platform engineers a flexible, extensible foundation for cloud innovation at scale.\nPulumi is launching its [IDP](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-face-off-to-idp-or-not-to-idp/) to enable developers to spin up cloud environments easily while automatically maintaining best practices and security, thanks to a new agentic AI feature that can be accessed verbally if needed. This is designed to address the common problem of platform teams being bottlenecks.\nThe IDP aims to empower developers -- in addition to line-of-business staff -- without sacrificing time, security, or governance, CEO and co-founder[ Joe Duffy](https://thenewstack.io/qa-pulumis-joe-duffy-on-the-renaissance-of-infrastructure-as-code/) told _The New Stack._\n\"Pulumi IDP is the cloud infrastructure platform modern teams have been asking for -- multicloud, infrastructure-first, and deeply flexible,\" Duffy said. \"It enables organizations to move fast without breaking things or compromising on security or governance. This is about turning the cloud into a competitive advantage.\"\nDuffy said the eight-year-old, Seattle-based company reports over 1 million weekly [downloads](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/) of its tools. It already is a prominent player in [infrastructure automation](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-infrastructure-as-code/) with more than 3,500 customers and 350,000 global users.\n## **A New Chapter in Developer Enablement**\nPulumi compiled insights into its [IDP](https://thenewstack.io/idp-vs-self-service-portal-a-platform-engineering-showdown/) gained from hundreds of customer implementations, transforming bespoke internal solutions into a ready-to-deploy platform that meets enterprise needs out of the box, Duffy said.\nRather than forcing platform teams to choose between building highly customized solutions or adopting inflexible commercial offerings, Pulumi IDP offers a third path -- meeting teams at the infrastructure layer and extending upward to enable developer self-service.\n\"We've made it so that even line-of-business staff can use the IDP to save time on project deployments,\" Duffy said. \"Moderna, one of our customers, wanted to enable data scientists to actually spin up experimentation environments as they're doing vaccine research and development. Obviously, data scientists typically aren't cloud infrastructure experts. Now they can participate in the development of their tools. Moderna really needed to enable developers to spin up cloud environments as they're developing their software without the data scientists having to file tickets and wait for months.\"\nAnother early adopter, CLEAR, migrated from a lower-level HashiCorp Terraform-based stack to Pulumi, streamlining infrastructure deployment using a custom YAML schema that simplified cloud access for its development teams.\n## **Enabling Best Practices at Scale**\nPulumi IDP has an internal registry where platform teams can publish reusable infrastructure patterns such as components, templates, and policies. These building blocks -- written in any supported language, such as Python, Go, Java, C#, TypeScript, or YAML -- serve as standard blueprints for rapidly provisioning projects such as web apps, microservices, or data pipelines.\nThe registry supports built-in documentation, semantic versioning, usage tracking, and discoverability. Organizations can codify security, cost, compliance, and operational standards directly into these building blocks, ensuring new infrastructure adheres to internal requirements from the start.\nIn addition, this codification of organizational best practices brings rigor to infrastructure provisioning while giving developers the freedom to build faster without sacrificing oversight.\n## **Flexible Developer Interfaces With Built-In Guardrails**\nPulumi IDP provides developers and data scientists multiple entry points to create and manage infrastructure. Options in the package include a no-code user interface; low-code YAML-based CI/CD pipelines; direct IaC programming in preferred languages; and a REST API for full extensibility.\nThis flexibility enables teams with varied skill sets and workflows to adopt Pulumi IDP minus the friction of making a major tool change. Projects can be grouped into \"services\" -- logical containers that include configurations, secrets, documentation, and observability tools. These services can represent anything from a microservice or Kubernetes cluster to a Jupyter notebook or serverless workflow, depending upon the use case.\n## **Advanced Operations and Security Controls**\nPulumi IDP isn't limited to first-time provisioning--it also streamlines ongoing operations. Day-two capabilities include drift detection and remediation, policy auditing and enforcement, component lifecycle management, and change control with approval workflows. The latter has proven to be a huge time-saver, Duffy said.\nAnother feature is the new visual importer, which allows teams to bring previously unmanaged infrastructure under Pulumi's governance with minimal effort. This functionality simplifies onboarding and accelerates cloud rationalization projects.\nThe platform also introduces an advanced identity and access management (IAM) system with fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC), custom permissions, and integration with enterprise identity systems via SAML/SSO. These security enhancements further extend Pulumi's reputation for enterprise-ready infrastructure automation.\n## **SaaS and Self-Hosted Flexibility**\nPulumi IDP is available in two deployment models: a managed SaaS platform for most users and a self-hosted version for organizations with strict compliance or data residency requirements. The IDP integrates seamlessly with Pulumi's existing enterprise ecosystem, including [Pulumi Copilot](https://www.pulumi.com/product/copilot), an AI-powered infrastructure management tool; [Pulumi Deployments](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments) for workflow automation; [Pulumi CrossGuard](https://www.pulumi.com/crossguard/), policy-as-code for compliance; and [Unified REST API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/reference/cloud-rest-api/) for standardized integration across the stack.\n## **Availability and Roadmap**\nPulumi IDP enters public preview today and is available at no cost for existing Pulumi customers and community users. General availability, along with enterprise licensing and support plans, is scheduled for later this year.\nThe post [Pulumi's New Internal Developer Platform Accelerates Cloud Infrastructure Delivery](https://thenewstack.io/pulumis-new-internal-developer-platform-accelerates-cloud-infrastructure-delivery/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

    "content": "The emergence of [agentic AI](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/ai/learn/what-is-agentic-ai/) represents a paradigm shift from automated workflows requiring constant human oversight to autonomous systems that bridge the gap between insight and action. AI agents don't just analyze data. They understand operational context across distributed systems, take independent action within defined parameters and continuously learn. This can be a lifeline to any team struggling to manage critical operations amidst alert fatigue, resource constraints and disparate processes and tools.\n## The Convergence of Need and Capability\nThree key factors are converging to make the [adoption of agentic AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/) not only possible, but essential to unlocking operational excellence:\n  1. **Operational complexity:** Modern architectures with thousands of microservices and distributed systems have exceeded human capacity for real-time management.\n  2. **Data accessibility:** Organizations have vast troves of data scattered across logs, metrics, traces and incident history, but traditional tools can only analyze these sources in isolation. Agentic AI systems can deeply integrate with and correlate an entire landscape of enterprise data, creating a comprehensive operational picture that bridges previously siloed monitoring and response workflows.\n  3. **AI advancement:** Recent breakthroughs, like [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers/) (MCP), have elevated AI systems from simple pattern-matching tools into intelligent systems. Agentic AI can tap both historical and real-time data to understand complex operational scenarios, make nuanced decisions and independently take action within defined parameters.\n\n\nThe rise of AI agents presents an opportunity to fundamentally rethink digital operations and how to manage them more efficiently. Let's start by understanding exactly where and how these agents can best be deployed through three tangible use cases.\n## Three Agentic AI Use Cases for Operations Teams\nOne rule of thumb to successfully deploy agentic AI starts with the right framing.\nIt's not about how AI agents can _replace_ humans, but rather [how AI agents can _augment and guide_](https://thenewstack.io/six-ways-ai-is-upending-the-devops-lifecycle/)[ human expertise](https://thenewstack.io/six-ways-ai-is-upending-the-devops-lifecycle/). Operations teams handle different types of critical work that vary in complexity and require different levels of human oversight. Successful human-agent collaboration adapts to match the work's complexity and has the power to transform individual contributors into orchestrators of this new, autonomous digital workforce.\nLet's explore three fundamental types of operational work and how agentic AI can transform each one.\n### 1. Well-Understood Work: Autonomous Resolution\nWell-understood work includes common, recurring incidents and tasks that follow clear patterns, generate predictable outcomes and therefore have documented solutions. As teams encounter these operational issues multiple times, they already have well-established playbooks to resolve them, but these routine and repetitive tasks pull human expertise away from strategic delivery cycles that support business growth.\nAI agents can autonomously handle well-understood work by:\n  * Identifying and classifying incidents.\n  * Running diagnostics and remediation.\n  * Surfacing and implementing suggestions to improve resilience.\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of toil is innovation. By deploying agents to resolve well-known issues and tasks, teams are empowered to redirect their focus toward innovating and delivering better customer experiences that give the organization a competitive edge.\n### 2. Partially Understood Work: Supercharged Triage and Diagnosis\nPartially understood work involves incidents where the symptoms may be familiar, but root causes may vary due to system complexity. What begins as a latency spike in one service can cascade into system-wide degradation. In this scenario, teams might have some insight but need a more complex analysis across multiple infrastructure layers to learn what's causing the issue, which ultimately delays response.\nAI agents can drive higher efficiency in this scenario by:\n  * Correlating signals across tools in real time to assess potential impact radius and affected services.\n  * Surfacing relevant historical incidents and suggesting probable root causes.\n  * Pulling relevant runbooks and executing them with human-in-the-loop approval.\n\n\nHaving AI as a troubleshooting guide and assistant dramatically reduces the cognitive load on responders, enhancing decision-making and enabling faster action during critical moments. Instead of starting from scratch with each incident, teams can build upon AI-surfaced insights to resolve issues more efficiently.\n### 3. New, Novel Work: Anticipating Customer-Impacting Issues\nNew, novel work encompasses unprecedented situations and emerging patterns that haven't been seen before. These are the most complex challenges where traditional monitoring tools can tell you when something is wrong, but can't predict novel failure modes or identify subtle system degradation patterns.\nHere, AI agents serve as early warning systems and strategic advisors by:\n  * Detecting anomalous behavior patterns before they trigger alerts.\n  * Providing contextual recommendations based on similar patterns.\n  * Learning from each new incident to expand their knowledge base.\n\n\nThese AI-driven predictive capabilities enable teams to move from reactive to proactive incident management, building operational resilience to sustain service reliability and improve customer satisfaction.\n## Implementation Considerations\nAs organizations begin their agentic AI journey, four key principles can help ensure successful adoption and [sustainable, reliable value](https://thenewstack.io/a-five-step-operational-maturity-model-for-benchmarking-your-team):\n  1. **Start with well-understood, low-risk use cases:** Begin with routine incidents that have documented resolution paths and establish clear metrics for measuring AI performance.\n  2. **Prioritize security and governance:** Look for AI solutions with built-in guardrails and clear, secure protocols. Ensure all automated actions can be logged and auditable, and define clear escalation paths for edge cases.\n  3. **Ensure data quality and protection:** Proven, purpose-built solutions for handling critical work deliver mature operational intelligence that drives reliable AI action when it matters the most.\n  4. **Unify your AI ecosystem:** Choose solutions that integrate with your existing tech stack to drive visible impact on the [full operations lifecycle](https://thenewstack.io/six-ways-ai-is-upending-the-devops-lifecycle) and enable seamless AI and human workflows without needing an infrastructure overhaul.\n\n\n## The Future Is Now\nOrganizations that start implementing agentic AI today will be better positioned to handle tomorrow's operational complexity. With proven solutions delivering secure and reliable AI capabilities, the question isn't whether to embrace autonomous operations, but how quickly you can begin the journey to transform your digital operations.\nThe post [Top Three Agentic AI Use Cases for Modern IT Operations](https://thenewstack.io/top-three-agentic-ai-use-cases-for-modern-it-operations/) appeared first on [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).",

Some of its key features are real-time screen viewing, keystroke logging, and time tracking, with the former two being particularly interesting to cybercriminals.\nResearchers from Varonis and Synacktiv, who claim to have seen the attacks in the wild, say it all starts with a poisoned ad purchased on the Google Ads network. The ad is displayed to people searching for RVTools, a free Windows-based utility that connects to VMware vCenter or ESXi hosts. The ad leads to a trojanized version of the program, which deploys a backdoor called SMOKEDHAM.\n## Cloud backups in the crosshairs\nWith the help of the backdoor, threat actors deploy Kickidler, specifically targeting enterprise administrators and many of the login credentials they use every day. The goal is to infiltrate into every corner of the network and ultimately deploy the encryptor.\nThe two groups seen using Kickidler are Qilin and Hunters International, which seem focused on cloud backups, but seem to have hit a roadblock, Varonis said.\n\"Given the increased targeting of backup solutions by attackers in recent years, defenders are decoupling backup system authentication from Windows domains. This measure prevents attackers from accessing backups even if they gain high-level Windows credentials,\" Varonis told [_BleepingComputer_](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kickidler-employee-monitoring-software-abused-in-ransomware-attacks/).\n\"Kickidler addresses this issue by capturing keystrokes and web pages from an administrator's workstation. This enables attackers to identify off-site cloud backups and obtain the necessary passwords to access them. This is done without dumping memory or other high-risk tactics that are more likely to be detected.\"\nThe payloads targeted VMware ESXi infrastructure, the researchers added, encrypting VMDK virtual hard drives. Hunters International used VMware PowerCLI and WinSCP Automation to enable SSH, drop the ransomware, and run it on ESXi servers.\n### You might also like\n  * [Immutable backup storage is the best protection against ransomware, but many businesses don’t have it](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/immutable-backup-storage-is-the-best-protection-against-ransomware-but-many-businesses-dont-have-it)\n  * Take a look at our guide to the [best authenticator app](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-authenticator-apps)\n  * We've rounded up the [best password managers](https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager)",

Indeed, MLID underlines that this should be a similar launch to the [RX 9070 XT](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/amd-rx-9070-xt), which arrived in decent numbers as you might recall. (Although due to demand, the GPU still sold through very quickly, or at least models at or near MSRP did).\nThe caveat MLID adds is that the US may be slightly less well-supplied for the 9060 XT than other countries, or at least that’s a possibility.\nAnother point addressed here is that the 9060 XT won’t likely affect the stock of AMD’s 9070 XT in the near future, according to the YouTuber’s best guess.\n* * *\n## Analysis: Should Nvidia be worried? It looks that way\nIt certainly makes sense to me that RX 9070 XT (or vanilla 9070) stock wouldn’t suffer due to the launch of this third RDNA 4 GPU (not counting the GRE, which is Asia-only, for now anyway). That’s because the two existing graphics cards use the Navi 48 chip, whereas the 9060 XT is built around a different engine, the Navi 44 GPU.\nSo, the latter chip won’t cannibalize the former (not directly, anyway). And also because there’s more profit to be made on the pricier 9070 models – the XT in particular – it doesn’t make sense that AMD would want to miss out on that (by sacrificing any 9070 production in favor of the 9060 XT).\nIf AMD can indeed supply the RX 9060 XT in a decent quantity, as suggested here, that’s going to be trouble for Nvidia, which is struggling to get its RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards – which Team Red’s inbound RDNA 4 GPU should rival – onto shelves in any real number.\nYes, you can find RTX 5060 Ti models on sale, and there are a couple of flavors of the 8GB version around in the US currently. However, that’s more a reflection of the [general unpopularity of this GPU](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/as-i-predicted-nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-8gb-will-incur-a-motherboard-tax-it-suffers-a-significant-performance-loss-using-pcie-4-0) – and even then, the cheapest you’ll get is still 10% over the MSRP. With the better-received RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, I could only spot one in the US (all of this is at the time of writing), but this time it’s 15% over the recommended price, so you’re paying a premium.\nWhat we still don’t know is the MSRP of the RX 9060 XT, of course. Indeed, as noted at the outset, this GPU isn’t even officially confirmed yet, let alone the price. All we know is that there’s some kind of new RDNA 4 graphics card coming this quarter, though with the weight of the rumors at this point, it’s pretty certain to be the 9060 XT.\nPricing will be key, of course, and MLID believes that AMD is going to pitch the RX 9060 XT somewhere between $329 to $379 in the US (and in line elsewhere). That’s for the rumored 16GB version of the graphics card, too, not the 8GB variant (which will be launched alongside it, [at least according to some speculation](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/amds-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-gpu-reportedly-set-to-take-retail-priority-over-8gb-counterpart-is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-8gb-gpus)). At the lower end of that pricing scale, this could be a killer blow to Nvidia in the lower-mid-range space (again, depending on exactly how performance pans out).\nThere are too many unknowns to get overly excited yet, and looking at the overall picture – and where Nvidia is with its RTX 5060 models – I worry there’s not much of a driving force for AMD to have to pitch its new entrant to the GPU scene towards the more compelling end of the rumored range.\nWhat Nvidia has in its favor right now is that while the grapevine expects AMD to launch the RX 9060 XT very soon – on May 21, in fact – these graphics cards may not actually be [on shelves before June](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/amd-rx-9060-xt-could-launch-on-may-19-to-upstage-nvidias-rtx-5060-but-the-gpu-battle-will-really-begin-in-june). As ever, load up the seasoning with all this. What we do know is that [Nvidia’s RTX 5060 (non-Ti) goes on sale come May 19](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-confirms-on-sale-date-for-rtx-5060-gpu-setting-up-a-possible-showdown-with-amds-rumored-rx-9060-xt), though again, its 8GB of VRAM loadout (across the board) is proving controversial, just as with that version of the RTX 5060 Ti currently.\n### You might also like...\n  * [AMD Radeon RX 9070 review: a great choice if the RX 9070 XT and RTX 5070 are out of reach](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/amd-radeon-rx-9070)\n  * [Microsoft is digging its own grave with Windows 11, and it has to stop](https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-is-digging-its-own-grave-with-windows-11-and-it-has-to-stop)\n  * [I've reviewed three generations of 3D V-cache processors, and the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is the best there is](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d)",

The 4K Neo QLED lineup consists of four series: the QN95F, QN90F, QN80F and QN70F, though pricing has only been confirmed at this time for the QN90F.\nThe significant news here is that prices for the 4K range appear to be the same as last year, with the QN90F priced the same as the [Samsung QN90D](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-qn90d-review), one of the [best TVs](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-tv) of 2024, at launch. The 55-inch model, for example, costs £1,699, which happens to be the same as the 55-inch Samsung S85F, its entry-level OLED.\nThe Samsung QN990F has the same specs as the [Samsung QN900D](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-qn900d-review) and even clocks in at the same £4,999 price for its smallest 65-inch size. It will also use Glare Free anti-reflection tech, the NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor and 8K Upscaling Pro.\nThe QN990F will be one of two series to use the Wireless One Connect Box, an external connection hub that wirelessly transmits signals from connected sources to the TV itself. The other series to get that feature is The Frame Pro\nThese TVs are all available to pre-order at Samsung and other participating retailers such as John Lewis and Currys. Delivery is listed through Samsung’s website as 17th May. Below is a list of confirmed prices for each model and size revealed so far.\nThis isn’t the complete mini-LED or LED lineup, as QN80F and QN70F Neo QLED and other QLED model pricing is not confirmed, and no pre-order listings have appeared just yet.\n## 8K Neo QLED\n## Samsung QN990F\n  * 65-inch - £4,999\n  * 75-inch - £6,499\n  * 85-inch - £9,499\n\n\n  * [Pre-order the Samsung QN990F at Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/qled-tv/qn990f-75-inch-neo-qled-8k-mini-led-smart-tv-qe75qn990ftxxu/)\n\n\n## Samsung QN900F\n  * 65-inch - £3,399\n  * 75-inch - £4,699\n  * 85-inch - £6,799\n\n\n  * [Pre-order the Samsung QN900F at Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/qled-tv/qn900f-65-inch-neo-qled-8k-mini-led-smart-tv-qe65qn900ftxxu/)\n\n\n## 4K Neo QLED\n## Samsung QN90F\n  * 43-inch - £1,199\n  * 50-inch - £1,299\n  * 55-inch - £1,699\n  * 65-inch - £2,499\n  * 75-inch - £3,499\n  * 85-inch - £4,999\n  * 98-inch - £8,999\n\n\n  * [Pre-order the Samsung QN90F at Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/qled-tv/qn90f-55-inch-neo-qled-4k-mini-led-smart-tv-qe55qn90fatxxu/)\n  * [Pre-order the Samsung QN90F at John Lewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/brand/samsung/qn90f/_/N-1z13z13Zq2d4)\n\n\n## Samsung Frame Pro\n  * 65-inch - £2,099\n  * 75-inch - £2,999\n  * 85-inch - £3,999\n\n\n  * [Pre-order the Samsung Frame Pro at John Lewis](https://www.johnlewis.com/brand/samsung/frame-pro/_/N-1z13z13Zq2ao)\n\n\n## Upgrade on tech, but not on prices\nThe flagship 8K Samsung QN990F has had several upgrades. (Image credit: Future)\nEvery year, we expect to see a price increase when new TVs are released. This can be due to new tech that’s more costly to make or simply inflation. So whenever a brand like Samsung releases new TVs and the prices are either the same or cheaper than their predecessors, it’s welcome news.\nThere have been significant tech upgrades across the range, such as the QN90F using the NQ4 AI Gen3 processor (the same in the flagship OLED Samsung S95F), and Glare Free anti-reflection tech and 4K Upscaling AI Pro featured in the S95F. There are a lot of premium features on offer here, but with no price increase.\nEven though the 8K range comes at a premium price, again the QN990F has received several upgrades over its predecessor, the QN900D, such as Glare Free tech, a better processor, and more AI-based picture enhancements. But again, there’s no price increase at launch here for the QN990F series compared to its predecessor.\nSamsung’s Neo QLED TVs often feature among the [best mini-LED TVs](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/best-mini-led-tv) on the market simply down to the sheer performance they deliver. But with increasing competition from more budget brands such as Hisense and TCL, Samsung needs to sweeten the deal on its new TVs to keep customers tempted. Releasing the new lineup with no increased costs may certainly have done that.\n### You might also like \n  * [I tested Samsung's new wireless TV connection box, and gamers need to know one thing](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/i-tested-samsungs-new-wireless-tv-connection-box-and-gamers-need-to-know-one-thing)\n  * [Samsung announces UK pricing for its 2025 OLED TV lineup, and the news is a mixed bag for Samsung fans](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-announces-uk-pricing-for-its-2025-oled-tv-lineup-and-the-news-is-a-mixed-bag-for-samsung-fans)\n  * [The best Samsung TVs](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-samsung-tv)",

    "content": "* * *\n  * **Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games have announced a $49.99 price tag and August release date for** _**Mafia: The Old Country**_****\n  * **It comes amid Nintendo and Microsoft's moves towards $80 games**\n  * **This raises questions over** _**Grand Theft Auto 6**_**'s price when it launches in 2026**\n\n\n* * *\nWhile Rockstar Games' highly anticipated title, _Grand Theft Auto 6_ , is on the radar of most gamers with its [recent delay announcement](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-confirmed-but-its-been-delayed-heres-why) and [trailer release](https://www.techradar.com/live/news/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-2-live-analysis), another title that is also under Take-Two Interactive's umbrella finally has a release date - and its more affordable price tag may come as a surprise.\nIt has been revealed that _Mafia: The Old Country_ will launch on August 8, 2025, and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC. It will launch with a Standard Edition that comes in at $49.99 and a Deluxe Edition for $59.99, both of which are available for pre-order now.\nThis comes after Nintendo and Microsoft began raising the prices of some games to the $80 mark. It's worth noting that the new game prices for Microsoft won't come into effect until the start of this Holiday season, and we're still waiting to see whether Sony follows suit.\nHowever, the $49.99 price tag for _Mafia: The Old Country_ appears to be much less about Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games not following the $80 trend, and more about the game's shorter length and linear presentation. 2K president David Ismailer, said: \"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments,\" which hints at _The Old Country_ having a short runtime.\n[_Borderlands 4_](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/borderlands-4-gets-explosive-gameplay-deep-dive-and-a-new-release-date) also launches a month after, on September 12, but there isn't any pre-order or price information on that title yet. There's no doubt that the upcoming _Mafia_ game's price will have gamers wondering what this means for the looter-shooter and _GTA 6_.\n(Image credit: 2K Games)\n## Take-Two Interactive has the opportunity to embarass Nintendo, Microsoft, and any other company charging $80, but I don't think it will...\nTo say I detest $80, even $70 game prices, is an understatement and it's been sad to see Nintendo and Microsoft kickstart the trend. It's only a matter of time until Sony joins the party and for the large majority of game publishers to follow.\nI'm desperately hoping Take-Two Interactive don't budge but it seems unlikely. Gamers have been waiting for _GTA 6_ for twelve years, going on thirteen now due to its 2026 delay - and it's safe to say that a large majority of gamers are willing to pay over $80 for it.\nConsidering the rumors of the game's $2 billion budget, a higher price tag might be justified but if Take-Two Interactive were to charge $70 (or even lower) for the highly anticipated title, it would reflect poorly on Microsoft and Nintendo and help it fly off the shelves and smash even more records than it already likely will.\nThe reasoning is simple - it's _GTA 6_ , arguably the most anticipated game of all-time. Rockstar Games is in a league of its own when it comes to size, scope, and attention to detail and if I were going to choose between _Mario Kart World_ at $80 and _GTA 6_ with the latter being cheaper, it's an easy decision.\n### You may also like...\n  * [Five things we learned from the latest Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/five-things-we-learned-from-the-latest-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer)\n  * [Grand Theft Auto 6 looks mind-blowingly beautiful in latest screenshots](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-6-trailer-2-screenshots)\n  * [Spotify streams of the latest Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer song increased by 182,000% just two hours after the trailer dropped](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/spotify-streams-of-the-latest-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-song-increased-by-182-000-percent-just-two-hours-after-the-trailer-dropped)",

The best way to minimize the risk of exposure is to deploy the patch. A possible workaround is to disable the Out-of-Band Image Download feature, which could work well if the enterprise isn’t actually using it.\nCisco said it hasn’t seen evidence of in-the-wild abuse just yet, but users should still be on their guard.\nHere is a list of vulnerable devices:\nCatalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud  \nCatalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches  \nCatalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers  \nEmbedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst APs\nAnd here is a list of devices that are safe to use:\nCisco IOS (non-XE)   \nCisco IOS XR  \nCisco Meraki products  \nCisco NX-OS  \nCisco AireOS-based WLCs\n### You might also like\n  * [Millions of online shoppers could be at risk from hardcoded Shopify tokens](https://www.techradar.com/news/millions-of-online-shoppers-could-be-at-risk-from-hardcoded-shopify-tokens)\n  * Take a look at our guide to the [best authenticator app](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-authenticator-apps)\n  * We've rounded up the [best password managers](https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager)",

[Netflix horror movies](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/best-horror-movies) can be quite hit and miss but this is one of the best ones on there.\nNeed more horror recommendations this month?

After loving her work in Netflix’s _Russian Doll_ and _Orange is the New Black_ , Natasha Lyonne impressed me here too and I’m so excited to see what the second season of this mystery-a-week show brings.\nSeason 2 picks up with Charlie hitting the road once again after receiving a call from crime boss Beatrix Halp. She’s back on the road and there’s some amazing guest stars such as _Wicked_ ’s Cynthia Eviro and _The Office_ star BJ Novak, so the cast just keeps getting bigger and better.\nIn [Rian Johnson we trust](https://www.techradar.com/news/i-watched-rian-johnsons-poker-face-on-peacock-and-its-nothing-like-knives-out).

That might not sound instantly thrilling but with Phoebe Waller-Bridge (_Fleabag; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_) narrating the series, we're expecting her signature humor to keep the pacing lively.\n_Octopus!_ is a two-part series that sees an eclectic mix of characters, including scientists, explorers and enthusiasts, share their connections with the eight-limbed sea creatures that could easily become one of the [best Prime Video shows](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-amazon-prime-shows).\nI loved Netflix's _My Octopus Teacher_ and National Geographic's _Secrets of the Octopus_ on Disney+, both of which scored highly with critics, so I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes an instant hit. – _AS_\n  * [**Watch** _**Octopus!**_**on Prime Video now**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Octopus/dp/B0F1S6CB3C)\n\n\n## Nonnas (Netflix)\nLooking for a good comedy movie? _Nonnas_ should whet your appetite, perhaps literally, as it follows a man who opens an Italian restaurant with actual nonnas aka grandmothers as the chefs.\nFeast your eyes on this great cast too: Vince Vaughn leads a great line-up, including stars like Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Joe Manganiello and Linda Cardellini. This has all the key ingredients to become one of the [best Netflix movies](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-netflix-movies), indeed.\nIt's based on a true story, inspired by the life of Joe Scaravella, the owner of the Staten Island restaurant Enoteca Maria, where grandmothers are invited to work as chefs.

It's an action-packed one, focusing mainly on two storylines.\nThis time around, expect to see Cronos and Typhon’s rampage across Greece, as well as Heron helping Seraphim to get his lover, Priestess Gorgo, into the Elysian Fields. So there's a lot going on and plenty to wrap up before the season finale.\nThis mythical ancient Greece inspired series has had a good run, but it doesn't look like it'll be returning any time soon.

Indeed you could say it was ABSENT, MINUS, SANS and WANTING of its usual trickery, with Comic Sans the only gag pairing (unless I missed one).\nOut of the four groups, the one that was ranked easiest – LETTER SIGN-OFFS – had the potential to be the trickiest considering how old-fashioned ending a letter SINCERELY is.\nIt doesn’t seem that long ago that I’d wrestle over writing that or faithfully at the end of job applications. Now, BEST is the only way to go – or whatever our AI pals think.\nHow did you do today?

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the [NYT Games site](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) on desktop or mobile.",

Based on the footage from the recent livestream, she looks like a strong support unit who can restore HP and increase the maximum HP of your party members with help from her summon, Little Ica.\nWith all the HP scaling characters we've got in the game in the last couple of patches, it seems she will be a natural fit alongside Castorice and Tribbie – and a worthwhile upgrade to those teams currently running Luocha or Gallagher in the sustain role.\nThe second playable five-star in Cipher. She is on the Quantum element and follows the Path of Nihility. Her gimmick is all based around marking a single high HP opponent on the battlefield, performing follow-up attacks when allies damage that target, and using her ultimate to unleash a devastating amount of damage based on the total recorded damage the target has received.\nImage 1 of 3\nHyacine pairs up with her memosprite Little Ica to heal allies (Image credit: Hoyoverse)\nImage 2 of 3\nCipher applies a mark to targets and unleashes a huge amount of damage based on ally attacks (Image credit: Hoyoverse)\nImage 3 of 3\nA Mario Kart-style racing game is one of the events coming in Version 3.3 (Image credit: Hoyoverse)\nIt's a kit that makes a lot more sense in practice, with Hoyo showing off her effectiveness in combat with Acheron and Jiaoqiu in one party, and Castorice in another.\nI had no plans to pull her for my account, but now I could be tempted. However, anyone thinking of going for new characters will also have to consider that The Herta and Aglaea will also re-run during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the patch, respectively.\nWhile the new characters are the main draw, Version 3.3 will also introduce the next chapter in the game's story that builds towards the final battle of the Flame-Chase Journey. That will be a confrontation with the Sky Titan, a hundred-eyed giant bird named Aquila, who will also serve as a new end-game boss.\nOther new additions include a bizarre-looking racing event, the return of a combat event that looks to take inspiration from the item evolutions of Vampire Survivors, new relics to farm, and an expansion to the roguelite Divergent Universe mode that adds more buffs, rewards and mechanics.\n_Honkai: Star Rail_ Version 3.3 launches on May 21. The free-to-play RPG is available now on PC, mobile and [PlayStation 5](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5).\n### You might also like...\n  * [Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.7 adds a tired office Bangboo that I can seriously relate to](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-7-adds-a-tired-office-bangboo-that-i-can-seriously-relate-to)\n  * [Ugreen reveals exclusive Genshin Impact collection and they're some of the most eye-catching charging products I've ever used](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/ugreen-reveals-exclusive-genshin-impact-collection-and-theyre-some-of-the-most-eye-catching-charging-products-ive-ever-used)\n  * [The best free games in 2025: gaming fun at no extra cost](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-free-games)",

After the collapse of his marriage and getting fired from his job at an Indiana sporting goods store, Pryce hedges his bets, and future, entirely on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom named Santi (Peter Dager). _Stick_ is a heartfelt, feel-good sports comedy about a found family and their relationships set within the world of golf as it has never been shown before.”\nAs you can see from the trailer below, the 10-episode series looks to be another example of the type of hilarious and heartfelt comedy one of the [best streaming services](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare) have become masters of. With Wilson pitch perfect as the down and out Cahill looking for one last chance at glory, and with Peter Dager nailing the role of would-be golfing sensation Santi Wheeler, it’s like Ted Lasso coaching Happy Gilmore.\nAlso stepping out on to the green are Judy Greer as Pryce’s soon-to-be ex-wife Amber-Linn and Timothy Olyphant as his former rival while Marc Maron returns to the world of sports-com after [Netflix](https://www.techradar.com/uk/streaming/netflix)’s _GLOW_ , playing Cahill’s sardonic pal Mitts.\nThe new trailer comes amid plenty of [exciting updates for fans of Apple TV+ comedic output](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/apple-tv-renews-two-of-its-best-shows-with-over-93-percent-on-rotten-tomatoes-its-a-structure-that-we-100-percent-know-works). While the streamer was once considered _the_ home of big budget sci-fi with the likes of [_Foundation_](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/foundation-season-3-isnt-out-yet-on-apple-tv-but-a-fourth-season-is-reportedly-on-the-way-with-a-new-showrunner) __ and _For All Mankind_ , it’s quietly been making a name for itself as the home of hilarious, emotional character driven comedy.\nWhile Rob McElhenney’s [_Mythic Quest_ was cancelled after four seasons](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/apple-tv-confirms-its-game-over-for-mythic-quest-as-the-hit-show-is-canceled-after-4-seasons), _Stick_ arrives on the heels of hit movie making satire [_The Studio_](), which has just been renewed for a second season, while it’s also been confirmed that parenting sitcom _Trying_ will be back for a fifth season. Meanwhile, the streamer's OG comedy hit [_Ted Lasso_ is also set to make a return](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/believe-it-baby-ted-lasso-season-4-is-officially-in-development-for-apple-tv-and-jason-sudeikis-will-reprise-his-role-as-the-titular-soccer-coach).\n## Is Ted Lasso still returning?\n(Image credit: Apple TV Plus)\nWhile many assumed we’d said goodbye to Jason Sudekis’ soccer coach at the close of season three, back in March, Apple TV+ confirmed one of the [best Apple TV+ shows](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-apple-tv-shows) would be returning for a fourth outing. Sudeikis is confirmed to be back, alongside Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein and Jeremy Swift. The rest of the cast are yet to be announced, but we’d imagine we’ll see more familiar faces re-signed to AFC Richmond.\nPlot details are thin on the ground at the moment, but it’s heavily rumored that Ted will return to London to coach the Richmond women’s team announced in the season three finale. In the season four announcement, Sudeikis teased: “As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,’ in season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.” For more on Ted's comeback, you can check out [everything we know so far about the return of the hit Apple TV+ show.](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/ted-lasso-season-4)\nIn the meantime, _Stick_ looks like a show _Ted Lasso_ fans are going to love, and if you’re missing the antics at the soccer club, well this should go a fair way to filling that hole.\n### You might also like\n  * [3 new Apple TV+ movies and shows you should stream this month](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/3-new-apple-tv-movies-and-shows-you-should-stream-in-may-2025)\n  * [10 new Apple TV+ shows and movies are coming in mid-2025 – here are the 3 I'll be streaming on my Apple TV 4K](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/10-new-apple-tv-shows-and-movies-are-coming-in-mid-2025-here-are-the-3-ill-be-streaming-on-my-apple-tv-4k)\n  * ['I’m such a huge sci-fi nerd': Murderbot stars reveal what attracted them to the unusual Apple TV+ show](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/im-such-a-huge-sci-fi-nerd-murderbot-stars-reveal-what-attracted-them-to-the-apple-tv-show)\n\n\n  * [3 new Apple TV+ movies and shows you should stream this month](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/3-new-apple-tv-movies-and-shows-you-should-stream-in-may-2025)\n  * [10 new Apple TV+ shows and movies are coming in mid-2025 – here are the 3 I'll be streaming on my Apple TV 4K](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/10-new-apple-tv-shows-and-movies-are-coming-in-mid-2025-here-are-the-3-ill-be-streaming-on-my-apple-tv-4k)\n  * ['I’m such a huge sci-fi nerd': Murderbot stars reveal what attracted them to the unusual Apple TV+ show](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/im-such-a-huge-sci-fi-nerd-murderbot-stars-reveal-what-attracted-them-to-the-apple-tv-show)",

The report indicated that Apple Watch would use onboard cameras and microphones that would \"help the device see the outside world and use AI to deliver relevant information.\"\nNow, the same source, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, says the chip that powers that device could be just 18 months away. \"The company is developing a chip called Nevis for the camera-equipped Apple Watch and a component named Glennie for the similarly outfitted AirPods,\" Gurman wrote in his latest [Power On](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/apple-is-developing-specialized-chips-for-glasses-new-macs-and-ai-servers?srnd=undefined&sref=HrWXCALa) newsletter. \"Apple is aiming to have those chips ready by around 2027,\" he continued.\n## Apple Watch cameras close at hand?\n(Image credit: Future)\nWhile we knew the expected 2025 [best Apple Watch](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-apple-watch) lineup – the [Apple Watch SE 3,](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/apple-watch-se-3) [Apple Watch Series 11](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-11), and [Apple Watch Ultra 3](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/apple-watch-ultra-3-all-the-leaks-and-rumors-so-far-and-what-we-want-to-see) – wouldn't feature cameras, as Gurman had previously suggested a camera-equipped Apple wearable was \"generations away.\" Turns out, he might have only meant two generations away, which means that for most users, the next Apple Watch you buy might have a camera.\nAs we've previously noted, a wearable AI smartwatch could provide users with contextual information about landmarks they see on holiday, directions, and more. It's a concept that underpinned some failed wearables like the Humane AI Pin, and would lean heavily on Apple's excellent existing Apple Intelligence Feature, Visual Intelligence.\n[Longer-term, it could be part of a future recently alluded to by Apple's Eddy Cue](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/i-love-my-iphone-too-much-to-give-it-up-in-10-years-even-if-eddy-cue-says-that-might-be-the-future), who remarked off the cuff that we might not need the [best iPhones](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone) 10 years from now. Cue made his comments in the context of the rapidly evolving AI industry, so it's important not to extrapolate too much from them. However, an AI-powered smartwatch, or perhaps lightweight smart glasses (which Apple is also working on), could well be one such device that unlocks that iPhone-less future.\nA more cynical approach would reveal that Apple and Cue's comments are probably just a ruse to stop the US Department of Justice from blowing up its $20 billion deal with Google for the default spot as the iPhone's search engine, presumably in the hope the court is less likely to intervene if it thinks the iPhone is a dying breed.\nIt seems unlikely Apple would jettison its obscenely successful iPhone ecosystem in favor of a niche wearable that remains an iPhone accessory at this stage. More likely, a camera-equipped Apple Watch would just be one more feature on the iPhone's already comprehensible companion – in other words, another reason for users to consider forking out for one of the [best iPhones](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone).\nStill, mark your calendars for 2027, as it sounds like big changes are on the way.\n### You might also like...\n  * [7 hidden features on your Apple Watch you should start using right now](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/7-hidden-features-on-your-apple-watch-you-should-start-using-right-now)\n  * [I've been wearing an Apple Watch for 10 years – these are the 5 settings I change right out of the box](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/ive-been-wearing-an-apple-watch-for-10-years-these-are-the-5-settings-i-change-right-out-of-the-box)\n  * [I've been using an Apple Watch for 10 years – here are three common mistakes even I've made](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/ive-been-using-apple-watch-for-10-years-here-are-three-common-mistakes-even-ive-made)",

This is possible thanks to Nvidia's custom chip, which was recently claimed to be the T239 by PC hardware YouTuber, [Geekerwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pr_V8rtzrE).\nBesides the upgraded resolution, the game will receive a major visual boost with improved lighting, anti-aliasing, and notably an improved frame rate. It's worth highlighting that the Switch port of the critically acclaimed title runs at a playable 30fps, but at the sacrifice of visual quality and potential dips in more graphically intensive areas.\nThe same applies to the PC version; while performance and visual quality are unsurprisingly much better than the Switch port, Nvidia's Frame Generation is necessary when exploring areas like Hogwarts, as frame pacing and frame rate drops are an issue.\nThe potential issue for the Switch 2 is that Frame Generation is seemingly missing from the Switch 2's DLSS - and that may not come as a surprise since Nvidia RTX 3000 GPU series owners (and older) don't have access to it at all.\nDespite the improved hardware (specifically the T239 GPU), it begs the question of whether demanding games like _Hogwarts Legacy_ - which is prone to major performance dips depending on scenery - will be able to run at higher frame rates, without Frame Generation.\n(Image credit: Future/Nintendo)\n## No Frame Generation puts the Switch 2 at a disadvantage against other handhelds\nFrom what it sounds like, _Hogwarts Legacy_ and plenty of other Switch 2 ports will rely on Nvidia DLSS to hit higher frame rates while maintaining good image quality. However, my only concern is that the chip may not be enough to get over the line when playing demanding triple-A titles like [_Cyberpunk 2077_](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077) - at least without access to Frame Generation.\nOther handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and now even the [Steam Deck (via DeckyLoader)](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/steam-deck/steam-deck-fans-youre-in-for-a-good-one-amds-fsr-3-frame-generation-is-now-available-on-valves-handheld-thanks-to-a-new-decky-plugin) have access to AMD's FSR 3 frame gen, providing higher frame rates where necessary. It certainly isn't the best solution in all cases, as most games need a decent base frame rate to allow frame gen to work smoothly without increased input lag and stuttering.\nRegardless, it's a better tool to have than nothing, and right now, it looks like the Nintendo Switch 2 won't have access to frame generation software whatsoever. I hope I'm wrong and when it launches on June 5, we're able to analyze great performance results in demanding games, but I just can't see it happening...\n### You may also like...\n  * [The duels in Hogwarts Legacy have taught me I'm a magical klutz](https://www.techradar.com/features/hogwarts-legacys-duels-have-taught-me-im-a-magical-klutz)\n  * [A Hogwarts Legacy sequel is a big priority for Warner Bros](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-a-big-priority-for-warner-bros)\n  * [Nintendo acquires notable port studio responsible for bringing Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy to Switch](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/nintendo-acquires-notable-port-studio-responsible-for-bringing-mortal-kombat-1-and-hogwarts-legacy-to-switch)",

But a few things like limited compatibility and its very niche use cases saw it lose a star and a half in our review.\nClearly there must be some budding farmers on PlayStation, as Thrustmaster has now come out with a version of the SimTask FarmStick for the [PS5](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5) and [PS5 Pro](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review).\nNow I’ll freely admit I’m not a huge simulator fan, but I do appreciate peripherals that are fully dedicated to help (somewhat) replicate the controls of real-world vehicles. And the SimTask FarmStick looks festooned with the right buttons for operating heavy farming machinery.\nAs someone who comes from a farming background, I’ve been around a fair few modern tractors, and these days they tend to sport controls that look closer to gaming joysticks than traditional steering wheels and gearsticks.\nThe SimsTask FarmStick PlayStation is very similar to the Xbox version, with 18 buttons on its base, six buttons on the stick, two rocker switches, a thumbwheel and a mini-stick on the main joystick. Naturally, the Xbox button has been replaced by a black PlayStation one.\n(Image credit: Thrustmaster)\nThere is a catch here: to get the most out of the Simtask Farmstick PlayStation you need to use it with the steering wheel peripheral. But I think if you’re already looking at dedicated peripherals for Farming Simulator 25, you should go full throttle on it and get the SimTask Steering Kit.\nPre-orders for the Simtask Farmstick PlayStation are live now for $179.99 / £99.99 ahead of its June 4 launch.\n### You might also like\n  * [Five things we learned from the latest Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/five-things-we-learned-from-the-latest-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer)\n  * [Forza Horizon 5 shines on PS5, but the Realms update left me wanting more](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/forza-horizon-5-ps5-preview)\n  * [Far Cry 4 and Assassin's Creed 3 director 'hates' the Nintendo Switch 2 Game Key Card system, 'We’re losing some of what made the business special'](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/far-cry-4-and-assassins-creed-3-director-hates-the-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-system-were-losing-some-of-what-made-the-business-special)",

Even the most eagle-eyed experts can fall victim, with [untold sums of money](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/fake-jobs-and-phone-calls-how-americans-lost-usd12-5-bn-to-fraud-in-2024) being lost to these nefarious schemes every year.\nThat doesn’t mean the situation is hopeless, though, and Google is now taking the fight to scammers with the help of [artificial intelligence](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know) (AI). According to a [recent blog post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/) from the company, there are three areas where Google is using AI against scams: Chrome, Google Search, and Android.\nIn Chrome, Google is deploying its [Gemini Nano](https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/this-could-be-the-next-gemini-ai-trick-you-get-on-your-android-phone) on-device large language model (LLM) to provide an Enhanced Protection mode to users. Google says this “keeps users twice as safe from phishing and other scams versus our Standard Protection mode.”\nThe AI does this by distilling its knowledge of scams in order to analyze suspicious websites and alert users to threats, even if the dangers are new and haven’t been seen before.\nAs for Search, Google says AI “helps us detect and block hundreds of millions of scammy results every day,” with 20 times as many fraudulent pages being caught than before Google enlisted the help of AI.\nGoogle claims this approach has reduced airline-related scams appearing in Search by up to 80%, for example.\n## AI on Android\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\nWhile many of these improvements are cross-platform changes that will be seen on different devices, there are also some Android-exclusive tweaks that are putting AI to good use against scams.\nOne example is website notifications on [Android phones](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-android-phones). If you’ve allowed a scam website to send you notifications (without realizing it is a scam), you could be barraged by fraudulent alerts that try to steal your data. In cases like that, Google has just launched AI-powered warnings specifically for [Chrome on Android](https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/this-new-feature-for-chrome-for-android-is-going-to-make-tidying-up-your-tabs-easier).\nWhen a suspicious notification is detected, Chrome on Android will warn you that the alert might be a scam. You can then turn off notifications from the website in question, or view the alert itself, at which point you will again be able to unsubscribe or always allow the alerts if you don’t think they are nefarious.\nThere are also improvements coming to [Google Messages](https://www.techradar.com/computing/software/google-messages-could-get-a-big-design-upgrade-soon-here-are-4-useful-features-that-are-coming) and Phone by Google. These detect ongoing scams that start out innocently, but quickly evolve into dangerous situations, which might be hard for traditional scam-protection methods to spot.\nWhatever device you use, it looks like you could benefit from Google’s recent rollout of AI to fight against scams. With bad actors constantly improving their tactics, AI’s ability to quickly analyze huge reams of data could spare you from the fraudsters.\n### You might also like\n  * [This new feature for Chrome for Android is going to make tidying up your tabs easier](https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/this-new-feature-for-chrome-for-android-is-going-to-make-tidying-up-your-tabs-easier)\n  * [Fake jobs and phone calls: How Americans lost $12.5 bn to fraud in 2024](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/fake-jobs-and-phone-calls-how-americans-lost-usd12-5-bn-to-fraud-in-2024)\n  * [Common internet scams and how to avoid them](https://www.techradar.com/pro/common-internet-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them)",

But while the crackdown is indeed coming to more places, it's not doing so at high speed.\nThat's according to Warner Bros Discovery's CEO of streaming, JB Perrette, who explained during a [conference call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4783685-warner-bros-discovery-inc-wbd-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript?open_reset_password=true&origin=confirm_registration&source=email_registration_email%3Aconfirm_registration) that \"the password sharing crackdown... will take 12 months to 18 months to get to full steam\".\nIt's still coming and will begin to be more enforced as the pricing for 'Extra Members' is announced in more regions, but it looks like for the time being at least Max is more interested in growing subscribers by deploying the carrot rather than the stick.\n## How Max wants to take subscriptions to the max and bring its shows to the UK and Europe\n(Image credit: Jeff Kravitz/Warner Bros. Discovery)\nAs Perrette told investors and journalists, there are \"several big levers\" to improve its streaming business and revenues. The first is rolling out to more places: \"We've still got almost half the world to go to in terms of rollout in new markets.\" Those new markets will include the UK, Germany and Italy \"in the beginning of next year\".\nThe second big lever is getting more subscribers in the places where Max is already available. Perrette noted that Max is just 12 months into the \"lower priced ad-light\" service \"to go after more price-sensitive consumers.\"\nBut for Perrette, \"content is obviously the fuel of this entire thing\" and the content slate for \"the next 18 to 24 months is stronger than anything we've ever had and more consistent... we went from not good to good\" and the next step is \"to go from good to great. That will help engagement, that will help time spent, that will help monetization.\"\nDisney's David Zaslav also took part in the conversation, and said that the bundling that's worked well in the US will be coming to other countries too. \"Not just a bundle for price, but one that has a better customer experience... what we did here in the US with Hulu, Disney+ and Max.\" As Zaslav explained, the bundles mean \"less marketing, much lower churn\".\nZaslav predicts more consolidation in the streaming market. \"Ultimately there's going to be 5 or 6 players,\" he said. Bar a few regional players that may be dependent on sports, \"there will be [only] a few global players... it'll be a better consumer experience and some of those 5 or 6 may come together in a bundle to make that experience even more compelling.\"\n### You may also like\n  * [The Last of Us season 2 is an even bigger hit on Max – here are 3 similar shows with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-an-even-bigger-hit-on-max-here-are-3-similar-shows-with-over-90-percent-on-rotten-tomatoes)\n  * [IT: Welcome to Derry – everything you need to know about the new Max horror series](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/it-welcome-to-derry-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-max-horror-series)\n  * [The White Lotus season 3 finale has Mike White already thinking of where the hit Max series should go next](https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-has-mike-white-already-thinking-of-where-the-hit-max-series-should-go-next)",

We know the price for the Spanish market [courtesy of an Amazon leak](https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-leak-gives-us-our-first-look-at-the-flagship-headphones-and-hints-at-a-key-design-change) on its Spanish website, but the details of US and UK prices haven't been similarly shared – although we can take a pretty good guess as to what those prices will be.\nHere's the teaser, followed by six things to expect from next week's WH-1000XM6 launch event.\n> [A post shared by Sony Australia (@sonyaustralia)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJaJhHjzonq/)\n> A photo posted by on \n## 6 things to expect from the Sony WH-1000XM6 (based on rumors)\n## 1. A small price hike\nThe Amazon leak included a price for Spanish buyers of €470 including tax; without tax that works out as €439.\nThat's roughly $499 / £439 / AU$770, which sounds about right: rumors suggested we'd see a price hike for Sony's 2025 model. The current model launched at $399 / £380 / AU$649.\n## 2. The hinge is back! Back! BACK!\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4s (above) had a hinge to help them fold down into their carrying case, a design feature that appears to be returning on the XM6s. (Image credit: Future)\nNewly leaked imagery on [The Walkman Blog](https://thewalkmanblog.blogspot.com/2025/05/sony-wh-1000xm6-exclusive-leak.html?m=1) shows the redesign, which includes redesigned earcups, a thick and foldable hinge and a wider headband.\nThat's good, because one of the key criticisms of the current model is what some users have found to be a fairly flimsy construction.\n## 3. Even better noise cancelling\n(Image credit: Future)\nThe leaked specification on Amazon highlighted a new HD noise cancelling processor, dubbed QN3. The QN3 is reportedly seven times faster than the QN1 that's in the current WH-1000XM5.\nThat's accompanied by 12 microphones, Multi Noise Sensor technology and an automatic noise cancelling optimizer; together that should mean an improvement to Sony's already excellent noise cancellation.\n## 4. Improved audio processing\nThe Integrated Processor V1 in the XM5s included the QN1 processor, so an updated version of that processor should mean better sound too.\nSony's leaked marketing materials say that the WH-1000XM6 have hi-res audio, DSEE Extreme, LDAC, Adaptive Sound Control, Personalized Spatial Audio and 360 Reality Audio with head tracking.\n## 5. Small, rigid drivers\nOne of the surprises in the XM5 was that Sony moved to smaller drivers than the ones in the XM4, dropping the size by 25% to 30mm. The drivers this time around are 30mm too.\nAs we said in our [Sony WH-1000XM5 review](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-wh-1000xm5-wireless-headphones), smaller doesn't mean worse: the 30mm driver \"makes use of a high rigidity dome and soft edge to take some of the bite off of higher-pitched sounds.\"\nWe found the XM5 to sound better than the XM4 (although there's not a lot in it, so if you see the XM4s going really cheap, then go for it).\n## 6. A better case\n(Image credit: Future)\nThe Walkman Blog reports that the case has been redesigned: the zipper is gone, replaced by a magnetic closure, and there's a small pocket for your 3.5mm and USB cables.\nA few XM5 owners have been posting on Reddit about the zip on their cases (above) failing, so this may be a reaction to that; hopefully the magnet is as strong as the one on Apple's odd [AirPods Max](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/airpods-max) case.\nWe will of course be following the launch event and we'll update you with all the confirmed details and the price in your area, too.\n### You might also like\n  * [The best headphones 2025 tested by our experts](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-headphones-1280340)\n  * [The best over-ear headphones 2025 for all budgets](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-over-ear-headphones-1280342)\n  * [The best noise cancelling headphones in 2025 so far](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-1280490)",

At least going by Intel’s own internal testing, anyway.\n* * *\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n## Analysis: A surprise addition\nBut wait a minute, wasn’t this whole elevated voltage bug already cured? Well, officially, it was. In October 2024, after the last patch before this new one, [Intel said the stability problems were fully fixed](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/intel-finally-confirms-instability-issues-with-13th-gen-and-14th-gen-cpus-are-fully-fixed-but-some-owners-may-still-be-worried) – but apparently they weren’t. Not quite.\nOkay, so to be fair to Intel, this is a niche situation. Not that many folks leave their PC on for days running some kind of light workload constantly, and so this is something that the average user is (presumably) not going to encounter.\nThat said, maybe you do at least leave your PC on for multiple days at a time – even if it’s mostly not doing anything – and as such, it’ll seem prudent to apply the patch anyway. Besides, there could be other minor side effects stemming from whatever issues this new release fixes up, so I’d recommend – as Intel does – that everyone apply the patch as a matter of course.\nHopefully, as Intel claims, there won’t be any performance impact from installing this patch. But if you’re concerned about that possibility, just wait for independent testing of the microcode update – which will happen soon enough – to confirm that your PC won’t be slowed down by this.\nThis latest installment in the instability saga does make you wonder if there might yet be further patches deployed by Intel in the future, too.\n### You might also like\n  * [AMD responds to reports of 9800X3D CPU issues](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/got-a-ryzen-9000-cpu-in-your-gaming-pc-you-might-need-to-watch-out-for-this-chip-killing-bug)\n  * [Hang on handheld fans – we could be seeing AMD's FSR 4 upscaling on new handhelds after all if this new RDNA 4 leak is legitimate](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/hang-on-handheld-fans-we-could-be-seeing-amds-fsr-4-upscaling-on-new-handhelds-after-all-if-this-new-rdna-4-leak-is-legitimate)\n  * [Here are the best cheap processor deals right now](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-processor-deals)",

One user with access posted a screenshot to Reddit showing what the new function will look like once it’s rolled out widely.\n> [RCS message delete is also rolling out to beta people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ki4bpz/rcs_message_delete_is_also_rolling_out_to_beta) from [r/GoogleMessages](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages)\nWe first heard of [Google’s plans to introduce an unsend button](https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/google-messages-could-soon-let-you-delete-messages-for-other-people-and-i-cant-wait-to-pretend-my-cringiest-jokes-never-happened) back in February when Android Authority shared an APK teardown, and the site's writers [managed to get it working in March](https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/google-messages-remote-delete-will-soon-save-you-from-texting-embarrassment-and-heres-how-it-works#viafoura-comments). A feature like this has been a long time coming for Google Messages, but even when it does roll out it’ll come with some slight drawbacks.\n## So far, ‘Delete for everyone’ is limited to large group chats \nWhen it comes to unsending texts, Google Messages is behind the likes of WhatsApp and iMessage, which have offered the ability to delete messages for everyone in a chat for quite some time. It’s good to see that Google is catching up, but there are still two catches you should note.\nAs discussed in our previous reports, it’s likely that Google will stick with its 15-minute window for its ‘Delete for everyone’ feature, meaning that if you want to remove a text from a conversation, you’ll have to act rather swiftly. But that’s not the only issue that users have noticed.\nAlthough the Reddit post above gives an insight to how Google Messages’ new unsend feature will look, the user also draws our attention to the feature only being accessible in larger group chats. For them, ‘Delete for everyone’ only works in a group chat with 12 members, and they have yet to find a 1:1 chat that allows them to delete messages for everyone.\nAs it stands this new function has a lot of limitations, but because it’s only in the very early stages of roll out we’re hoping that Google will amend these once it's widely available to all Google Messages users.\n### You might also like \n  * [Google Messages is finally getting a group chat upgrade it should have had years ago](https://www.techradar.com/computing/software/google-messages-is-finally-getting-a-group-chat-upgrade-it-should-have-had-years-ago)\n  * [I compared Google Gemini's new image editing feature to ChatGPT's, and it's much better at sticking to the original](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/i-compared-google-geminis-new-image-editing-feature-to-chatgpts-and-its-much-better-at-sticking-to-the-original)\n  * [Google confirms Android 16's useful new battery health tools will skip older Pixel phones](https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-confirms-android-16s-useful-new-battery-health-tools-will-skip-older-pixel-phones)",

    "content": "* * *\n  * **10Web announced a new AI-powered Website Builder API**\n  * **Developers can build fully-fledged ecommerce sites, not just \"visit cards\"**\n  * **Additional features were announced, too**\n\n\n* * *\n10Web, known as one of the [best website builders](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-website-builder), just announced the launch of its AI Website Builder API, a new tool that will allow website developers to turn “any text input” into a “fully-functional” website hosted on WordPress.\nIn a press release shared with TechRadar Pro, 10Web said that the API runs on proprietary technology that was developed “before generative AI went mainstream”. The company claims the tool can be used by companies serving both entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that website creation can be embedded directly into product flows.\nThe generated websites are fully customizable, ecommerce-ready, and hosted on 10Web’s infrastructure, it was said.\nIn the press release, the company said that the API runs on a custom builder engine that creates fully tailored websites instead of “just pre-filled layouts”. It creates unique page structures, business-specific designs, content, functionality, and visuals.\nApparently, multiple AI models are leveraged in the engine, including Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Every agent is trained to perform a precise, unique task within the website builder.\n10Web says advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o-mini-azure and Claude 3 Sonnet are “fine-tuned for performance inside the WordPress ecosystem”.\n## Ecommerce features\nFurthermore, the site is built on WordPress, and it’s not limited to basic “visit card” websites, 10Web said. Product management, inventory, payments, shipping, checkout, all of these features are supported and powered by WooCommerce.\nFinally, the 10Web AI Co-Pilot allows users to modify layouts, edit widget settings, and generate new sections in real-time, using natural language.\n“As an entrepreneur, I know how many ideas die simply because building a website feels overwhelming. That’s the barrier we’ve been working to break,” said Arto Minasyan, founder and CEO of 10Web. “We created 10Web AI Website Builder so that the next generation of entrepreneurs — whether they’re launching a service, a storefront, or a side project — can get online instantly, with powerful tech working quietly in the background. This API puts the power of our years of work — across AI, hosting, and WordPress — into the hands of partners who can help millions of people get online.”\n10Web will soon be expanding on its offering, the company stressed, saying that AI Co-Pilot for on-page editing, enhanced ecommerce & business management tools, and more, will be coming “soon”.\n* * *\n### More from TechRadar Pro\n  * [10Web claims its new AI tool can help you build an online store in just 10 minutes](https://www.techradar.com/pro/10web-claims-its-new-ai-tool-can-help-you-build-an-online-store-in-just-10-minutes)\n  * Check out our roundup of the [best AI website builders](https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-ai-website-builder) on the market\n  * Learn more about Wix with our full [Wix review](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/wix)",

The report further notes that the files \"don't appear to be placeholders,\" but doesn't rule out the possibility.\nIf these images are the real deal the Galaxy Watch 8 could mark the end of an era for Samsung, with the retirement of its iconic circular design leaving the Pixel Watch as the [best Android smartwatch](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-android-smartwatch) still embracing the circular chassis.\nWith the Galaxy Watch 8 expected to launch in July, we don't have long to wait before we find out.\n### You may also like\n  * [3 of the most exciting new features coming to your Galaxy Watch with the One UI 8 Watch update](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/3-of-the-most-exciting-new-features-coming-to-your-galaxy-watch-with-the-one-ui-8-watch-update)\n  * [Whoop unveils two new wearables, but their best features are hidden behind a paywall](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/whoop-unveils-two-brand-new-wearables-three-new-subscription-tiers)\n  * [The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 seems set to bring back the Classic – and it might even make me switch from my Garmin](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-seems-set-to-bring-back-the-classic-and-it-might-even-make-me-switch-from-my-garmin)",

It comes with advantages though, including apparently making this screen around 19% thinner than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold displays, as well as being lighter.\nThat in turn could help Apple keep the foldable iPhone thin, with previous reports suggesting it could be just 4.5mm thick when unfolded and between 9mm and 9.5mm thick when folded.\n## Samsung could also benefit\nThe successor to the Z Fold 6 could benefit from Apple's requirements (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future)\nThat won’t necessarily make it any slimmer than the upcoming [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7), which is also rumored to be slimming down a lot compared to the [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6). But interestingly, according to this report Samsung is only making its own upcoming phone thinner because of the work it’s doing to meet Apple’s display requirements.\nSo, in other words the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 may have a similar screen, but Samsung might not have pursued this if Apple hadn’t reportedly required it.\nThe foldable iPhone’s display probably won’t be identical to whatever the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has though, as Apple will apparently hold branding trademarks for the foldable iPhone’s screen, so it may well be even thinner than the Z Fold 7’s display.\nAnd this new screen isn’t just said to be thinner and lighter than Samsung’s existing foldable displays, it also apparently has improved peak brightness, normal brightness, and color reproduction. So, this screen could be a real upgrade on the foldable displays we’ve seen to date.\nSadly, we probably won’t see it for a while yet, with the foldable iPhone not likely to launch before late 2026. But we may at least see some of these improvements in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is likely to land this July.\n### You might also like\n  * [Apple’s foldable iPhone is tipped to beat the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold in two key ways](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apples-foldable-iphone-is-tipped-to-beat-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-in-two-key-ways)\n  * [The iPhone 17 could miss out on a long-awaited display upgrade – here's why Apple fans are upset](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17-could-now-miss-out-on-a-long-awaited-display-upgrade-heres-why-apple-fans-are-upset)\n  * [The iPhone 17 Pro looks chunky in the latest leak, but it could still sell better than the sleek iPhone 17 Air](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17-pro-looks-chunky-in-the-latest-leak-but-it-could-still-sell-better-than-the-sleek-iphone-17-air)",

The headline here is that Samsung’s S95F flagship, successor to the [Samsung S95D](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s95d-review) (one of 2024’s [best TVs](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-tv)), is pricier than its rival LG G5 flagship across the board. The 65-inch S95F costs £2,499, whereas the 65-inch G5 is £100 cheaper at £2,399.\nThis is confirmation of the story we posted last week with prices of the 55 and 65-inch S95F appearing via a listing on John Lewis’ website.\nElsewhere, however, the Samsung S90F clocks in at £1,899 and £2,699 for its 55- and 65-inch models, respectively. These are the same prices as for the equivalent LG C5 sizes, meaning Samsung OLED fans won’t have to consider a cheaper price.\nInterestingly, however, there seems to be no 42-inch S90F model for the UK, meaning the LG C5 will face less of a challenge in this size.\nSamsung also revealed prices for its new Dolby Atmos soundbars: the HW-Q990F, HW-Q930F and new QS700F and QS750F models. The HW-Q990F serves as the flagship and successor to one of 2024’s [best soundbars](https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-top-10-best-soundbars-1288008), the [HW-Q990D](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/soundbars/samsung-q990d-review).\nPrices for each model are listed below. Each TV can be pre-ordered from Samsung UK or from retail partners, including John Lewis and Currys.

The new TVs are either the same price or pricier across the board. You can’t help but feel that, with this delay, Samsung could have launched its 2025 sets at a _slightly_ cheaper price to try and tempt potential customers.\nBut this is where things get interesting: Price drops are more than likely to happen soon, where the bidding war inevitably occurs and Samsung and LG try to attract customers. This is only good news for us, especially when we’re seeing big improvements in some of the 2025 TVs from both brands.\nWith an improved OLED Glare Free 2.0 coating, the [Samsung S95F looks to have solved the S95D’s crushed blacks issue](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/i-tested-samsungs-new-flagship-oled-tv-and-it-fixes-my-one-key-flaw-with-its-predecessor-and-has-mind-blowing-brightness). The LG G5, which we rated five out of five stars in our [LG G5 review](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-g5-review), takes brightness, color, and clarity to a new level thanks to its new four-stack OLED panel. And these are just a few of the upgrades in the flagship models.\nAdmittedly, the [LG C5](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-c5-oled-tv-review) didn’t turn out to be a big upgrade over the [LG C4](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-c4-review) when we tested it, and we’ve not yet tested the Samsung S90F, which also doesn’t look to be a big upgrade over its predecessor\nEither way, as the year continues, we can expect to see prices drop on all the new TVs as LG and Samsung will try to win customers over with the best prices. It could be a dog-eat-dog year.\n### You might also like \n  * [The best Samsung TV 2025 for all budgets, tested by our reviewers](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-samsung-tv)\n  * [I tested Samsung's new top mini-LED 4K TV, and the Glare-Free screen tech makes a big difference](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/i-tested-samsung-news-top-mini-led-4k-tv-and-the-glare-free-screen-tech-makes-a-big-difference)\n  * [The Samsung S95D is our TV of the Year – and it's thanks to a mix of old and new tech](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/the-samsung-s95d-is-our-tv-of-the-year)",

Now, that's no longer the case. This [massive leak](https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge) includes polished marketing images in three colorways that show off the S25 Edge’s screen, titanium build and super-slim side profile, alongside its glass screen protector, dual rear cameras, the USB-C charging cord and SIM-removal tools that come in the box.\nYou can see the images below:\nImage 1 of 3\nA clear image of the S25 Edge's side, back cover, camera array and three colors (Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 2 of 3\nCamera, processor and battery details, as well as a clear look at the face of the device (Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 3 of 3\nWhat's in the box and another view of it's slim profile (Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\n* * *\n  * **Leaked promotional images for the Galaxy S25 Edge give a detailed look at its design**\n  * **Images of its silicone case and leather-like Kindsuit case also leaked**\n  * **Seemingly confirms previously leaked specs like a 200MP main camera and IP68 rating**\n\n\n* * *\nWhile Samsung’s not confirmed the legitimacy of these images, it's hard to deny that they display the professional finish and variety we’ve come to expect when the brand launches a new phone. We can see the S25 Edge's incredibly thin 5.8mm thick side, and three colors that will reportedly be titled Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver and Titanium Jetblack.\nWe’d already seen many specs leak, including the details that it’ll feature a screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor, a 3,900mAh battery, wireless charging, and have an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.\nHowever, these new images further confirm that its dual rear camera setup will consist of a 200MP and a 12MP ultrawide lens, and add that the main camera sports a 2x \"optical quality zoom\". We also again see that IP68 rating, \"all-day battery\", \"the most powerful processor optimized for Galaxy\" – rumored to be the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset – and while there’s a USB-C cable in the box, as with pretty much all Samsung handsets, there’s no charger included.\nAnd, if you look especially closely, you can see the images state that the device is \"made to last\" with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back.\nAnd that's just half of what this leak provides. We're also getting a better look at the official cases for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in various colors, and how they'll help showcase the thinness of the device.\nImage 1 of 4\nThe Galaxy Edge's silicone case in three colors (Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 2 of 4\n(Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 3 of 4\n(Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 4 of 4\n(Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nAccording to the leaker, the images above are of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge silicone case in black, blue and gray. There is also reportedly a translucent silicone option. Below, however, is what is being called the 'Kindsuit case' for the S25 Edge. Already being used with the Samsung Galaxy S25, it's a leather-like synthetic material available in the same three colors.\nImage 1 of 2\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge's 'Kindsuit case' in three colors (Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\nImage 2 of 2\n(Image credit: Samsung / Android Headlines)\n## Old news, new detail\nWhile this new report and photo set hasn’t really taught us anything new – there's definitely something exciting about this new phone, and given our incredible experiences with the [Samsung Galaxy S25](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review), [S25 Ultra](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review), [S24 FE](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review) and [Galaxy A56](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-a56-review), we’re especially keen to see if the South Korean tech giant can keep up its winning streak in what looks set to be a widely adopted new form factor – even Apple’s getting on board, if rumors of the [iPhone 17 Air](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/huge-iphone-17-air-news-teased-in-new-report-3-things-you-need-to-know) are accurate.\nIf these images are legitimate, and whether or not you think a thinner phone is necessary, it's certainly an attractive device – and they go a long way to clearing up any doubts we had that the super thin titanium frame will be a drawcard. In combination with what looks like a great camera, a durable frame and a beautifully fast display, it's clear it has the makings of one of 2025’s [best phones](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone).\nThe biggest unanswered question is, of course, how much that slim profile will set us back. [Last week's leak](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-has-just-leaked-in-full-including-specs-renders-and-pricing) stated it would sit around $1,415 / £1,065 / AU$2,205, but thankfully, we won’t have to wait long to find out.\n### You might also like...\n  * [Samsung can make the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as thin as it likes, I'm not buying a phone with a 22:9 screen](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-can-make-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-as-thin-as-it-likes-im-not-buying-a-phone-with-a-22-9-screen)\n  * [I've used a Samsung The Frame TV for years, and here's why The Frame Pro is a huge upgrade](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/ive-used-a-samsung-the-frame-tv-for-years-and-heres-why-the-frame-pro-is-a-huge-upgrade)\n  * [Honor takes a swipe at Samsung in teaser for its upcoming Galaxy A56 rival](https://www.techradar.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-takes-a-swipe-at-samsung-in-teaser-for-its-upcoming-galaxy-a56-rival)",

By identifying and repurposing these mechanisms, ECHO can deploy a custom payload that disables the malware from within.\n## A self-spreading remedy for botnets\nBotnets - a network of infected computers controlled by malicious actors - have long posed a serious cybersecurity threat. They can lock down workflows, expose sensitive data, and inflict financial losses.\nOrdinarily, removing botnets is a tedious, manual process that can take days or even weeks. ECHO aims to change that. In testing, it successfully neutralized 523 out of 702 Android malware samples, achieving a 75% success rate.\nThe idea of hijacking malware’s communication channels isn’t entirely new. In 2019, Avast and French authorities collaborated to dismantle the Retadup botnet in Latin America. While successful, the effort was difficult to reproduce.\n“This is a really good approach, but it was extremely labor-intensive,” said Brendan Saltaformaggio, associate professor at Georgia Tech. “So, my group got together and realized we have the research to make this a scientific, systematic, reproducible technique, rather than a one-off, human-driven, miserable effort.”\nECHO works by first mapping how the malware deploys code. It then analyzes whether these deployment channels can be reused to carry a new, benign payload that disables the original infection.\nOnce validated, this remediation code is tested and deployed. The process significantly reduces botnet response time and limits potential damage.\nThe tool, now open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/CyFI-Lab-Public/ECHO), isn’t meant to replace traditional security solutions but to complement them.\n“We can never achieve a perfect solution, but we can raise the bar high enough for an attacker that it wouldn’t be worth it for them to use malware this way,” Saltaformaggio explained.\nOrganizations using [antivirus](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-antivirus), [EPP](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software), and other [malware protection](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-malware-removal) tools can turn to ECHO to streamline remediation once a breach is detected.\n### You might also like\n  * Downloaded something dodgy?

    "content": "* * *\n  * **Apple's reportedly working on a new chip to power smart glasses, which should be ready in 2027**\n  * **These first smart glasses from Apple will likely take on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses**\n  * **The company is also reportedly still working on a more advanced pair**\n\n\n* * *\nApple’s been rumored to be working on smart glasses for what feels like forever, and it makes sense considering that this wearable gadget would be lighter than the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/apple-vision-pro-review-the-spatial-computing-revolution-is-here-and-i-love-it) with a slimmer all-around design and, hopefully, lighter on the wallet as well.\nA new report from [Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/apple-is-developing-specialized-chips-for-glasses-new-macs-and-ai-servers) details that the Cupertino-based tech giant is making progress on a chip that will power “its first smart glasses.”\nThe report notes that ‘progress has been made’ on the chip, which means that internal work on the smart glasses is ramping up and that production on the processor is set to start by the end of 2027.\nNow, dates can move and change, but that would put these smart glasses on the road for release in about two years.\nThese aren’t the full-fledged AR glasses that have long been rumored, though; rather, the report says these smart glasses “would compete with the popular Ray-Ban spectacles” from Meta. The [Meta Ray-Bans](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-collection-review) are a hit for the company, landing in a similar build to classic glasses. They allow one to take photos or videos without taking a phone out and offer easy access to the Meta AI assistant.\nApple’s exact feature set for these smart glasses that wouldn’t overlay the world around you isn’t set as of yet, though. According to the report, “Apple is currently exploring non-AR glasses that use cameras to scan the surrounding environment and rely on AI to assist users.”\nThis sounds pretty similar to what Meta Ray-Ban offers and also to [Visual Intelligence](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/i-tried-iphone-16s-visual-intelligence-and-now-i-understand-why-apple-added-camera-control) on the [iPhone 16](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-16-review) lineup – and iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max – which uses Google or ChatGPT to identify what’s in the scene. Hopefully, by 2027, though, Apple Intelligence will be more widely rolled out, with AI-powered Siri in the hands of plenty of consumers on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\nSeeing that this reported chip is modeled after the Apple Watch’s SoC, it’s likely that these smart glasses would pair with another device like an iPhone, probably in a process similar to setting up an Apple Watch or AirPods.\n(Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol)\nHowever, Apple isn’t just switching to focusing on building smart glasses without AR. The report notes that this new model and the previously rumored one are in development, and that Tim Cook really wants to beat Meta in the world of smart glasses.\nOffering more than one model when the time comes for a release would be an easy way to attract more consumers, especially if it lowers the entry price.\nEven so, we’re far out on Apple’s rumored smart glasses, as two years puts them at the earliest of 2027, but I’d bet we'll see plenty more rumors and reports in the lead up to that.\nIn the more immediate future, though, [Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference will kick off on June 9, 2025](https://www.techradar.com/computing/software/apple-just-announced-wwdc-2025-starts-on-june-9-and-well-all-be-watching-the-opening-event), and the company should share more about its next-generation platforms and Apple Intelligence at large. Who knows, we might even get a more substantial update for the Vision Pro, which could hint at future glasses.\n### You might also like\n  * [New Meta XR glasses again tipped to land later this year – well ahead of Apple's rumored AR glasses with Apple Intelligence](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/new-meta-xr-glasses-again-tipped-to-land-later-this-year-well-ahead-of-apples-rumored-ar-glasses-with-apple-intelligence)\n  * [Rock 'n' roll will never die – and neither will this modular Bluetooth speaker with an 'unlimited' battery life](https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/rock-n-roll-will-never-die-and-neither-will-this-modular-bluetooth-speaker-with-an-unlimited-battery-life)\n  * [Google’s surprise Android XR glasses tipped to land in 2026 – and my only complaint is they aren’t launching sooner](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/googles-surprise-android-xr-glasses-tipped-to-land-in-2026-and-my-only-complaint-is-they-arent-launching-sooner)",

Not necessarily for its picture quality or the tech onboard, but more so due to the fact that it’s extremely aesthetically pleasing.\nWhen it’s off, it’s not a big, black rectangle on your wall or propped up on a cabinet – instead, it displays artwork or photos, and rather than a thick bezel around the screen, it’s wrapped in a bezel that makes it look like a picture frame.\nIt’s been a winning combo, and with the screen gaining the same matte finish as the flagship [Samsung S95D OLED TV](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s95d-review) in recent generations, works of art now look even more realistic as screen reflections are blocked.\nAnd that’s what makes [The Frame Pro](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/i-saw-samsungs-new-the-frame-pro-mini-led-tv-and-its-whole-new-work-of-art) such an interesting addition to Samsung’s lineup – it replaces the larger-screen sizes of the standard Frame with much of the same feature set, plus offers two key upgrades.\nThe standard QLED screen is replaced with NeoQLED, which features Mini-LED backlighting, and there's now a Wireless One Connect box for wirelessly connecting sources. It’s an especially appealing upgrade for folks who already have a standard Frame TV and are after a better quality picture or those who have always been interested, but were waiting for the image quality to be kicked into a higher gear.\nIt also keeps a premium price tag. Here’s how the Frame Pro breaks down by size:\n  * **65-inch The Frame Pro for $2,599.98 / £2,099 / AU$3,499**\n  * **75-inch The Frame Pro for $3,599.98 / £2,999 / AU$4,499**\n  * **85-inch The Frame Pro for $4,699.98 / £3,999 / AU$5,999**\n\n\nEven so, in typical Samsung fashion, it’s already discounted. The [65-inch is $2,199](https://www.samsung.com/us/lifestyle-tvs/the-frame/65-inch-class-the-frame-pro-neo-qled-4k-tv-ls03fw-sku-qn65ls03fwfxza/), the [75-inch is $3,199.99](https://www.samsung.com/us/lifestyle-tvs/the-frame/75-inch-class-the-frame-pro-neo-qled-4k-tv-ls03fw-sku-qn75ls03fwfxza/), and the [85-inch is $4,299.99](https://www.samsung.com/us/lifestyle-tvs/the-frame/85-inch-class-the-frame-pro-neo-qled-4k-tv-ls03fw-sku-qn85ls03fwfxza/).\nI’ve been using a 55-inch The Frame with the matte finish and a Disney metallic silver frame bezel for a few years as my bedroom TV, and after spending some time with the Frame Pro, here’s why I think it’s a significant upgrade over the original.\n## Disconnecting the One Connect Box is a bigger deal than it sounds\n(Image credit: Jacob Krol/Future)\nPart of the appeal of the Frame TV was that one cable connected to the TV itself, and it came from the external One Connect Box, which serves as a central hub for the HDMI, optical, and other ports, allowing you to more effortlessly, and effectively, cable manage your home entertainment setup.\nWhile the Frame Pro still requires a power cable, albeit a thinner one, that’s the only connection you’ll make anywhere near the TV. The One Connect Box is wireless, and a good bit slimmer, and can be placed up to 30 feet away from the TV itself. This infinitely frees up placement options for the Frame Pro – either on the included stand or mounted using the included bracket – and it doesn’t mean any shortcoming for picture quality. It can stream up to a 4K resolution picture at up to 120Hz refresh rate as long as it’s within 30 feet of the Frame Pro.\n(Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol)\nThe new box itself takes up considerably less space than the previous One Connect Box, as well, meaning it should be easier to find a spot, and you get the freedom of placement. I have a feeling many folks with a current Frame TV will be jealous of the wireless box, though Samsung has made it clear that it is exclusive to the Pro.\n## The jump to NeoQLED should be a big one, and it looked sharp in early testing\n(Image credit: Jacob Krol/Future)\nNow, I only spent about an hour with the Frame Pro, and unfortunately, it wasn’t alongside the standard Frame but instead a competing model – likely Hisense’s Art TV. Even though I couldn’t do any side-by-side comparisons, the NeoQLED upgrade is noticeable on its own, just as it was when I saw it at CES 2025.\nThe Frame Pro delivered excellent picture quality with high brightness and popping colors in some tests. Future Labs also conducted some early benchmarking and found that it reached 1,000 nits of brightness at its peak, which is 400 nits over the standard Frame’s brightness.\nSamsung’s testing room was pretty dim, and the Frame Pro got quite bright. It was great for some test content, ranging from YouTube videos of varying quality levels to Netflix shows.\nIt’s a much more solid TV overall, with better hardware to deliver stronger contrast and more vivid color. I really look forward to spending more time with the Frame Pro, which also provides a bit more value within the Frame lineup.\nThe Frame, now Frame Pro, has always cost more than Samsung’s core QLED TVs and was priced at the same level or more than some NeoQLED models, so having a much-improved display type is a delight here.\n## It’s still a great-looking TV that does the not-a-TV trick\n(Image credit: Jacob Krol/Future)\nThe Frame has always been the most aesthetically pleasing TV, and the Frame Pro takes this up a notch. It still displays art very well with great detail and realism. Especially if you pay extra to wrap the Frame Pro in the frame bezel, which completes the look.\nI ran through more than a dozen pieces of artwork, all available from Samsung’s Art Store, which is built into the TV and costs extra ($4.99 a month or $49.99 a year in the United States). All looked particularly sharp and vivid… well, at least if that’s how the artist intended it.\nAnd to keep the realistic approach, so you might do a double-take, Samsung switches off local dimming and 120Hz display so as not to up the brightness too much when in Art Mode. This can also help with energy consumption.\nAll in all, the Samsung Frame Pro is still one to watch. If you’ve been waiting for a substantial upgrade to the Frame, this is the tech giant’s answer. It’s more than the equivalent leapfrog of when Samsung added the matte, anti-reflection coating.\nPlus, that Wireless One Connect Box will make finding a home for the Frame Pro a little less challenging. The only downside would be the limited sizing for the Frame Pro – anything smaller than a 65-inch, and to get the Frame effect, you'll need to be alright with the standard QLED picture and a hardwired One Connect Box, but at least you'll get a boosted refresh rate as well.\n### You might also like\n  * [I'm very impressed with the Samsung S95F's anti-glare technology, but I'm far more excited for the other TVs of 2025 – here's why](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/im-very-impressed-with-the-samsung-s95fs-anti-glare-technology-but-im-far-more-excited-for-the-other-tvs-of-2025-heres-why)\n  * [Samsung’s Ballie robot companion still comes in yellow, but has more AI and a promised 2025 launch](https://www.techradar.com/home/smart-home/samsungs-ballie-robot-companion-still-comes-in-yellow-but-has-more-ai-and-a-promised-2025-launch)\n  * [Is the Galaxy S25 Edge ready for its debut?

Without proper oversight, unauthorized tools can leak data, bypass security protocols, and expose systems to attack, especially when used by administrators with elevated access.\nOrganizations must respond not by cracking down, but by modernizing. This includes establishing inclusive AI policies and deploying secure infrastructure - starting with strong [endpoint protection](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software) to detect rogue applications and [ZTNA solutions](https://www.techradar.com/best/ztna-solutions) to enforce strict access controls in distributed environments.\nIvanti notes AI isn’t the problem; the real issues are unclear policies, weak security, and a lack of trust.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "* * *\n  * **Pinterest has debuted a set of new AI-powered visual search tools**\n  * **The AI tools enable users to explore fashion by vibe, mood, or aesthetic**\n  * **The results are aimed at helping produce personalized shopping ideas**\n\n\n* * *\nPinterest has always been about visuals over text. Now, with the help of AI, you can figure out how to describe those visual inspirations and even get a chance to buy your favorite items, starting with women’s fashion.\nA growing number of Pins on Pinterest will have specific pieces of an outfit or aesthetic highlighted with a shimmering animated glow. Click on, say, the plaid skirt or the blue jacket, and Pinterest will show you some of the words to describe the item and help you find more like it without you needing a fashion dictionary.\nPinterest is using generative AI and Visual Language Models (VLMs) for the new features. The VLMs essentially translate images into searchable terms, decoding your taste from an image and helping you shop for it. It's like a more nuanced reverse image search tool, one that can converse with you about your interest in vivid tones and stereopunk plaid.\nYou’re not expected to describe your dream outfit with perfect vocabulary. You’re not expected to know what kind of tailoring makes a jacket “structured casual.” You just have to know that you liked that one look for its vibe. Pinterest takes it from there.\n“Our visual search technology represents a shift in how users interact with and discover inspiration,” Pinterest vice president of design Dana Cho said in a statement. “We're not simply delivering search results – we're curating a personalized journey of discovery that empowers individuals to find their unique style, and shop it too.\"\n## Pin AI\nThere are other new AI features as well, including a new refinement bar that lets you tweak results on the fly. For instance, if you like a look but want to change its color or styling, you can use the refinement bar to filter for them or other elements like fabric.\nAnd if you spot something you want to use to start a visual search from within the app, you just need to long-press on it. Pinterest says it plans to expand the AI tools beyond women’s fashion eventually, but it makes sense that it would start there when it's such a major facet of the platform.\nPinterest's new tools don't mean it's entirely trusting of AI. The company has also begun adding new labels for AI-modified or AI-generated images and giving users the option to see fewer of them via topic filters. It’s a small but smart nod to the fact that inspiration is great, but that reality still matters when you're shopping for actual clothing.\nStill, it's an interesting approach to online shopping, and one that fits the way people shop in person by looking at clothes, not just describing them. The AI is like a personal shopper who understands most people rely on visual impressions and gut feelings to decide what to buy, rather than knowing stitch patterns and trend terms.\n### You might also like\n  * [Google’s AI Mode can explain what you’re seeing even if you can’t](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/google-ai-mode-can-explain-what-youre-seeing-even-if-you-cant)\n  * [Amazon's new AI guides know what you want to buy before you do](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/amazons-new-ai-guides-know-what-you-want-to-buy-before-you-do)\n  * [Perplexity AI's Comet browser will streak across the web this month](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/perplexity-ais-comet-browser-will-streak-across-the-web-this-month)",

It's also said to work at speeds comparable to humans.\n\"Vulcan works alongside our employees, and the combination is better than either on their own,\" Amazon Robotics Director of Applied Science Aaron Parness explained.\nAmazon now has more than 750,000 robots already in use across its warehouses, which it stresses are there to support and collaborate with human workers rather than replace them. Other projects include Sparrow, Robin, Cardinal and Proteus – the company's first autonomous robot.\n\"Our vision is to scale this technology across our network, enhancing operational efficiency, improving workplace safety, and supporting our employees by reducing physically demanding tasks,\" Parness concluded.\n### You might also like\n  * [We've listed the best free website builders](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-website-builder)\n  * Take payments online with the [best payment gateways](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-payment-gateways)\n  * [Amazon is spending billions to expand its delivery network across rural America](https://www.techradar.com/pro/amazon-is-spending-billions-to-expand-its-delivery-network-across-rural-america)",

You start it with a command phrase, like “Hey Meta, start live AI,” and the glasses would start recording your every move.\nThis includes being able to recognize people with facial recognition, and to remind you of things like your house keys if the glasses saw you forgot them.\n(Image credit: Meta)\nThe current [Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-collection-review) models are apparently already packed with the sensors they’d need to pull off this same feat of AI.\nUnfortunately, those familiar with Meta’s tests with the existing glasses have said the feature cuts their battery life to only 30 minutes, which isn’t ideal.\nMeta’s current focus is reportedly to have its in-development glasses – and a pair of Meta earbuds that will supposedly also boast cameras and super sensing software – run for hours on a single charge with this feature switched on.\n(Image credit: Ray-Ban / Meta)\n## Always watching\nIn many ways, I can see the advantage of this always-live AI assistant. Anyone who has locked themselves out wishes they’d had a little software assistant reminding them to pick up their keys before they leave home.\nAt the same time, it sounds like a privacy nightmare.\nPeople who point somewhat nervously at my Meta Ray-Ban glasses and ask, “Are those recording us right now?” always seem to relax when I show them they’re switched off or explain they only record when instructed, like if I say, “Hey Meta, take a picture.”\nNow, imagine I instead say, “Yeah, they’ve been recording you the whole time.” I imagine I’d lose a few teeth.\nThe Information's report also suggests Meta has reworked its privacy and safety policy to speed up innovation, which, in conjunction with the huge amounts of data this live AI will collect, isn’t something that fills me with joy. Personally, this seems like the time to tighten your privacy policies to ensure sensitive data isn’t shared in a way it shouldn’t be.\nI love my Ray-Ban smart glasses, but I'm not keen on an always-on AI (Image credit: Future)\nI expect this AI would come with some of Meta’s existing safety features, such as the light on the glasses being on while you’re recording, and it is at least a feature you have to manually activate, but (call me old fashioned) I can’t imagine ever wanting a camera to record my every move.\nOthers will probably feel similarly about these potential new always-on AI glasses. Just look at the backlash against [Microsoft’s always-on AI feature, Recall](https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/windows-11s-controversial-recall-feature-could-soon-arrive-for-copilot-pcs-i-just-hope-microsofts-tightening-of-its-privacy-is-up-to-scratch) – and that was an app that just took computer screenshots.\nAs with all rumors, we’ll have to wait and see what Meta announces officially, but I’m hoping the final product isn’t anything as scary as it sounds right now.\n### You might also like\n  * [Meta announces a big change to its Quest 3 game subscription – but it remains as great a deal as ever](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/meta-announces-big-change-to-its-quest-3-game-subscription-but-it-remains-as-great-a-deal-as-ever)\n  * [I took my Meta Quest 3 on a 3,000-mile flight so you don’t have to – here's what I learned](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/i-took-my-meta-quest-3-on-a-3-000-mile-flight-so-you-dont-have-to-heres-what-i-learned)\n  * [Mark Zuckerberg confirms new Ray-Ban smart glasses are coming ‘later this year’ – here are the 3 pairs I think we’ll see](https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/mark-zuckerberg-confirms-new-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-coming-later-this-year-here-are-the-3-pairs-i-think-well-see)",

    "content": "Google, just like Microsoft, continues its push of AI into its products. Google Chrome, the company's web browser, is getting its fair share of AI features. After announcing that AI would soon be able to [take over tasks from Chrome users](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/10/28/googles-upcoming-ai-project-will-take-over-tasks-in-chrome-for-you/) and that it [enabled real-time protection checks for all users](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/09/10/chromes-new-real-time-protection-feature-explained/), Google now revealed new security protections powered by its Gemini AI that are coming to Chrome and Android.\nGoogle [announced](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/) the new functionality on its The Keyword blog. The fact that the announcement was published on Google's main blog and not a Chrome or Security blog highlights the importance of the feature. The AI is designed to protect Chrome desktop users from scams and Android users who run Chrome get new spam warnings, courtesy of the AI.\n## Google Chrome: desktop AI protection\nGoogle says that it is adding the AI protection to Chrome's Enhanced Protection mode on the desktop. This Safe Browsing mode needs to be enabled by the user and has kept users \"twice as safe from phishing and other scams\" compared to the default standard mode according to Google.\nThe AI integration adds a new layer of protection to Chrome. It uses the Gemini Nano on-device large language model to provide \"instant insight on risky websites\" to \"offer protection, even against scams that haven't been seen before\" writes Google. The new feature is already being used by Google to \"protect users from remote tech support scams\". The company plans to expand the protection to Android and additional types of scams as well.\n## Chrome for Android: protection against spam messages\nGoogle is also making use of AI to protect users better against notifications from websites that are either outright maicious or trying to scam users. The on-device machine learning model steps in if a notification from a website appears to be problematic. Google Chrome will then display a clear warning to the user with the option to look at the notification or unsubscribe from the website, so that no further notifications will be received.\nUsers who believe a notification is legitimate may also allow future notifications to arrive on the device to avoid Chrome stepping in all the time.\n## Google Messages and Phone protections\nThe new Scam Detection feature in Google Messages and Phone by Google is using AI to determine scam call or messages. It is powered by an on-device AI-powered feature that displays a warning to the user if a phone call or message is likely a scam. Users may then use the report & block option to deal with this and future attempts, or to allow the call or message.\n### Closing Words\nAre we going to see an AI race between AI that is designed to secure and protect users, and AI that is designed to create sophisticated attacks to bypass these protections and lure human users into traps? Google and Microsoft continue to push AI protections into their products, and also other types of AI. But malware groups are also making use of AI.\n_Now You: would you allow local AI protections to run on your devices? Or won't you allow AI to run on your devices automatically under any circumstances? Feel free to leave a comment down below._\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

In February 2025, Apple announced that it had [disabled](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/24/uk-users-lose-access-to-apples-end-to-end-icloud-encryption-following-government-order/) its [Advanced Data Protection](https://www.ghacks.net/2022/12/15/whats-new-in-ios-16-2-and-ipados-16-2-update/) feature for iCloud users in the U.K.\nThis was a result of a Technical Capability Notice (TCN) issued under the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, which mandates that law enforcement be able to access user data, regardless of encryption. [Apple](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/08/apple-wants-to-add-ai-search-engines-to-safari-as-google-usage-begins-to-drop/) has challenged the TCN in court, arguing that the requirement jeopardizes the privacy and security of millions. Instead of crafting a backdoor in iCloud, it opted to disable the iCloud feature to protect users worldwide. Despite the cessation of the Advanced Data Protection feature, Apple has assured users that their health data, passwords, iCloud messages, and transactions remain securely encrypted.\nNow, the US House Judiciary Chair, Jim Jordan, and the Foreign Affairs Chair, Brian Mast, have written a joint letter to U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, emphasizing the potential cybersecurity risks that such a move poses not only to British users but to global citizens as well. They warned that a backdoor would introduce \"systemic vulnerabilities\" that could be exploited by cybercriminals and authoritarian regimes, heightening the stakes in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.\nJordan and Mast have urged the U.K. government to reconsider any issuance of TCNs that could compromise encryption standards, stating that such actions conflict with international human rights norms, including privacy rights upheld by the European Court of Human Rights.\nAs [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/us-lawmakers-slam-uk-encryption-backdoor-order-to-apple-warning-against-systemic-vulnerabilities) reports, a major cyberattack known as Salt Typhoon underscored the essential role reliable encryption plays in safeguarding personal data.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

This long-awaited sequel to EU4 promises to redefine the strategic landscape, offering players a vast array of complex systems that significantly diverge from its predecessor.\n[Paradox](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/04/29/cities-skylines-last-expansion-hotels-and-retreats/) is following its tradition by catering primarily to dedicated historical strategy gamers rather than beginners. The revamped gameplay of Europa Universalis 5 introduces an intricate web of mechanics that seems to create a steeper learning curve. New automation features facilitate the management of expansive empires, and help new players adjust, for example, by letting the AI handle your country's economy, or warfare. It goes deeper, and offers a great deal of customization.\nOne notable change in the [game](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) involves the requirement for a legitimate casus belli to initiate conflicts, making wars feel more deliberate and consequential. The enhanced parliamentary system gives significant weight to domestic politics, allowing or obstructing military decisions based on the desires of various estates. This shift underlines the game's emphasis on historical authenticity and the nuanced interplay of power and governance.\n[Players](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/04/pc-players-still-facing-blue-screen-of-death-bug-despite-activisions-update/) can expect to navigate a rich tapestry of nation types, each with unique mechanics. The map is larger than before, and gamers can choose to play as a settled country, or an army-based nation, an extraterritorial country, or Societies of Pops (tribal societies), each of which present distinct gameplay experiences. Additionally, the introduction of historical ages ties advancements to the game's timeline, fostering a global perspective and compelling players to adapt quickly to shifting political and economic climates.\nThe Swedish game studio has been revealing parts of the game for over a year. EU5's codename is 'Project Caesar', you can read the [developer diaries](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/megathread-links-to-all-tinto-developer-threads.1652130/) on Paradox Plaza to learn more about the mechanics, playable nations, etc. The [official trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI) for Europa Universalis 5 is available on YouTube.\nDespite its complexity, early impressions indicate that EU5 maintains a sense of wonder and discovery. The game will be released for Windows [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/), but a launch date has not been announced yet.\nSource: [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/europa-universalis-5-feels-like-the-ultimate-grand-strategy-game-drawing-on-paradoxs-entire-history-and-it-makes-me-feel-like-an-idiot/)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

It will soon allow users to search for and install applications from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/04/22/microsoft-store-installs-quicker-now-and-with-extra-telemetry/), without opening the store app.\nA screenshot shared by Giorgio Sardo, Vice President of Microsoft App Store & Apps, illustrates an example of searching for an app. This feature seems to be designed to assist users to discover apps and install them quickly, as opposed to opening the Microsoft Store app and looking up the app. The search result presents a card that displays the app's name, icon, and the description. It also contains a Get button, clicking on which installs the app on the computer. Alternatively, users may click on the \"Open in the Microsoft Store\" button, to view the app's listing, screenshots, permissions, system requirements, etc.\nThis search and install experience isn't restricted to the Start Menu, the Windows Search box on the Taskbar will also support the feature. While it sounds like a useful quality-of-life addition, this change does not come without controversy. Many users have previously expressed dissatisfaction with [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/07/finally-microsoft-is-making-ai-useful-in-windows-by-introducing-ai-agents/)’s attempts to promote apps and services through the Start menu, such as [OneDrive](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/03/29/windows-11-microsoft-rolls-out-start-menu-promotions/), [Microsoft 365](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/08/26/windows-10-start-menu-will-soon-display-ads-for-microsoft-365/), etc. Some users feel that such features veer into unwanted advertising territory. This has also raised questions about user privacy and the effectiveness of search results. There is also the risk of installing fake apps/malware that masquerade as legitimate versions of popular services.\nSardo [says](https://x.com/gisardo/status/1919768822896058634/photo/1) that the ability to install apps from the Windows 11 Start Menu will be rolling out to users shortly. It is unclear whether users will be able to disable the app search functionality from the Settings app, it may require editing a Group Policy, or making a change in the Registry.\nSource: [Beta News](https://betanews.com/2025/05/09/microsoft-is-giving-windows-11-users-the-option-to-install-apps-directly-from-the-start-menu/)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The first is to [subscribe to 0Patch](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/06/28/windows-10-support-until-2030-0patch-makes-it-possible/), which costs $30 per year as well, like ESU, but guarantees updates until at least 2030. The second is to migrate to Linux.\nMigrating to Linux is a daunting task. It is another operating system, which means it needs to be installed and configured, and files need to be moved over. Also, while many programs are available for Windows and Linux, there are notable exceptions.\n## End of 10\n[End of 10](https://endof10.org/) tries to help Windows 10 users move over to Linux. It has KDE backing, at least when it comes to hosting, which gives it credibility.\nThe project team highlights five reasons for switching to Linux:\n  * It is cheaper - Linux is free to install and use.\n  * It is ad-free and not spying no users.\n  * Good for the planet to keep using older PCs instead of purchasing new ones.\n  * Communities around the world support Linux and may help new users.\n  * Users are in control.\n\n\nWhile those are reassuring, the project's main goal is to bring Windows 10 users who want to switch to Linux but need help doing so in contact with local Linux communities. Windows 10 users who try to switch to Linux will have questions and may need help. The idea is to help them via local communities.\nThe website lists Linux communities that have pledged to help already. The list is relatively short, but communities from France, Germany, the United States or Thailand are already listed. There is a good chance that more will sign up. You can browse the list or use the intgrated search to find a suitable Linux community.\nThe website lists events as well that bring Linux communities and users together. These events are also designed to help Windows 10 users make the switch.\nLastly, there is also a guide, but it is the most basic guide that you will find. It is not really suitable for inexperienced users, as it does not include recommendations. The essence is that it asks users to search for Linux distributions for beginners to pick one.\n### Closing Words\nEnd of 10 is a useful project that could help Windows 10 users make the switch to Linux. It depends mostly on the availability of local Linux groups and their willingness to help.\nNow You: do you run Linux already, you a Window 10 user who plans to switch to Linux, or do you run a different operating system?

The news comes straight from the company's Senior Vice President, Eddy Cue.\nCue testified in court as part of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust [lawsuit](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/12/23/google-files-remedies-proposal-in-dojs-antitrust-case/) against Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Apple earns an estimated $20 billion-a-year from Google, just for enabling the latter's search engine as the default in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.\nRecent reports had revealed that Microsoft Bing had [gained a small chunk](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsofts-bing-gains-momentum-as-google-sees-decline-in-market-share/) of users, while Google's own numbers had dropped. Cue told the court that web searches on Apple Safari had dropped for the first time ever in April 2025. He attributed the change to the rise of AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity AI, Anthropic, etc. Cue says that Apple will be adding those options to Safari.\nApple has already partnered with OpenAI to provide [ChatGPT](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/06/11/here-are-the-new-features-in-ios-18/) as an option via Siri in iOS 18. The company is reported to be working on adding [Gemini support](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/24/ios-18-4-beta-hints-at-upcoming-google-gemini-support-in-apple-intelligence/). However, he stated these AI search providers won't be the default option. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/apple-working-to-move-to-ai-search-in-browser-amid-google-fallout) quotes Cue as saying that Apple has already held discussions with Perplexity. Apple was also interested in China's [DeepSeek](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/27/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek-ai/), [xAI's Grok](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/18/elon-musks-xai-unveils-grok-3-the-smartest-ai-on-earth/), Anthropic, but seems to have opted for Perplexity's service.\nCue also confirmed that discussions with Google had failed last year, because the Alphabet-owned company's term sheet had a lot of things that Apple wouldn't agree to. This resulted in OpenAI being chosen as the partner to be integrated into Apple Intelligence. Cue believes that AI services need to improve, and enhance their search indexes, but also said that the other features offered by AI services are making people switch to them quickly.\nGoogle has published a [statement](https://blog.google/products/search/statement-press-reports-about-search-traffic/) on its website that denied that its search usage is dropping, and that it's numbers were actually increasing.\nAI-powered search services could impact the entire search engine industry greatly, and in turn Apple's own ecosystem as well.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

It depends on the program where it ends when you hit the minimized button. Some let you choose, others decide the location for you and do not give you any say in the matter.\nGeneral system tray apps, like [Minimize To Tray](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/03/28/minimize-any-program-to-the-system-tray-with-minimizetotray/), [Traymond](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/11/16/traymond-is-an-open-source-tool-that-can-minimize-programs-to-the-system-tray/) or [Tray Everything](https://www.ghacks.net/2008/10/09/tray-everything/), and specialized apps, like [TBTray](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/04/14/tbtray-is-an-open-source-program-that-minimizes-thunderbird-to-the-system-tray/), give Windows users options in this regard.\n**Why you may want to push app icons from the taskbar to the system tray:** It is a good option if your Windows taskbar can't display all taskbar icons at once anymore. Some users do like to push apps that they do not really need to access much, or at all, to the system tray,so that they are out of the way. These can be Internet radios, download managers, monitoring applications, or any other program that does not need to be accessed frequently. So, web browsers or email programs probably not, but even those may make sense in some regards,as they are just a click away as well.\n## Trayy: open source, easy to use system tray pusher\nTrayy is a new open source application, inspired by the classic Windows app RBTray, is the latest addition. The application is compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and can send nearly every open program or Progressive Web App to the system tray.\nThe app is straightforward to use. [Downoad the](https://github.com/alirezagsm/Trayy) less-than 400 kilobytes file to the local system and unpack it. Run the application afterwards. Right-click on the Trayy icon in the system tray and select App List to add new programs. Just type the name of the application, e.g., Thunderbird, Google Chrome or Notepad, to get these to minimize to the system tray area. Save the list and the program handles the rest with ease.\nYou may also configure the programs to be displayed in the system tray area when they are closed and to hide on the tasbar (which is the default).\nNote that the functionality is only provided while Trayy is running. As our colleagues [over at Deskmodder](https://www.deskmodder.de/blog/2025/05/08/trayy-programme-und-apps-ins-systray-der-taskleiste-schicken/) note, you may want to consider adding Trayy to the Windows autostart to enable its functionality whenever the system is started. Otherwise, you'd have to launch Trayy manuel each time you want to make use of its functionality.\nTip: Check out our [guide on managing system tray icons in Windows](https://www.ghacks.net/2021/11/28/how-to-display-all-system-tray-icons-in-windows-11/).\n### Closing Words\nTrayy works well and it is a tiny open source app. If you have apps that you do not want on your Windows taskbar, you can give it a try to push them to the system tray area using the program.\n_Now You: Where do you prefer your minimized programs on?

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission attempted to block the deal in June 2023, but a U.S. Court allowed the deal to be completed.\nThe FTC believed that such an acquisition would restrict competition in the video gaming market, as it could give [Xbox](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) an unfair advandtage due to the popularity of games like Call of Duty, and that this could affect the quality, price and innovation among game developers and studios. A year and a half after the acquisition went through, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has delivered a decisive blow by rejecting the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction against a ruling by a U.S. district court. The appeals court also stated that the \"correct legal standard\" had been applied by the lower court when it refused to accept the agency's request to prevent the merger.\nMicrosoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also faced some challenges around the globe. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the [European Commission](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/05/15/ec-microsoft-acquisition-of-activision/) had cleared the deal, and it was eventually completed.\nBut, as [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ftc-loses-bid-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-which-already-happened-in-2023/) reports, the FTC still aims to thwart the already-done deal, despite having failed to block it multiple times. The appeals court panel, comprising three judges, pointed out that \"given the FTC’s failure to make an adequate showing as to its likelihood of success on the merits as to any of its theories, the district court properly denied the FTC’s motion for a preliminary injunction on that basis\". According to the FTC, “the subject of an administrative proceeding that remains pending before the FTC,”.\n[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition#comments) reports that both the FTC and Microsoft declined to comment on the matter.\nThough some gamers found the news amusing, some people pointed out that Microsoft has been releasing games on other platforms, including [PlayStation 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/), and that this was only became a reality because concerns were that the acquisition would be anticompetitive.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

Usually, users would have to switch to a different tab or app, to learn more about the things they couldn't understand. The Simplify function, as the name implies, is designed to make dense information more accessible, in a manner that does not sacrifice the essence of the original content. Google describes this as “minimally lossy” simplification. An important part of this feature is that it provides the easier version, without leaving the page.\nTo develop this feature, Google Research conducted [extensive testing](https://research.google/blog/making-complex-text-understandable-minimally-lossy-text-simplification-with-gemini/) with approximately 4,500 participants who were selected based on their expertise in various fields, including medical research, finance, literature, law, biology, philosophy, aerospace and computer science. Some participants were given the original versions, while some were given the simplified version. They were then tested on their capability to recall the text. Results showed that those who read the simplified versions grasped the material better, and retained the information more effectively, than those who engaged with the unaltered texts.\nUsing the Simplify feature is straightforward: users can select any challenging text within a web page in the [Google](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/18/google-gemini-live-video-and-screen-sharing-features-are-now-free-for-all-android-users/) app and tap on the \"Simplify\" icon. This action prompts a new window to appear with a simplified version of the selected content, significantly streamlining the learning process while browsing.\nThis feature is currently only available for iOS users, with no specific timeline provided for its availability for Android.\nSource: [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-app-on-ios-gets-a-new-feature-that-will-simplify-text-online), [Google](https://blog.google/products/search/simplify-google-app-ios/)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "OpenAI's latest AI models seem to have a big problem. A report reveals that the [GPT o3](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/17/openai-launches-o3-and-o4-mini-models-to-improve-chatgpts-reasoning-abilities/) and o4-mini are producing misinformation at an alarming rate.\nAI-generated misinformation, aka hallucinations, are common among most artificial intelligence services. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html) has published an investigation conducted by OpenAI that discovered its own models are generating more fake content than others. This in turn has raised serious concerns about their reliability.\nGPT o3 and o4-mini have been designed to mimic human reasoning and logic. When these were put to the test in benchmarks involving public figures, nearly one-third of GPT o3's results were found to be hallucinations. In comparison, [GPT o1](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/11/15/the-official-chatgpt-app-for-windows-is-now-available-for-free-users/) had less than half of that error rate in tests that were conducted last year. GPT o4-mini fared even worse, as it hallucinated on 48% of its tasks. When these models tackled general knowledge questions, hallucinations soared to 51% for GPT o3, and a staggering 79% for o4-mini.\n[OpenAI](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/23/openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome-from-google/) says that the hallucinating problem is not because the reasoning models are worse, but because they could simply be more verbose and adventurous in their answers, and are speculating possibilities rather than repeating predictable facts. Developers initially aimed for these systems to think critically and reason through complex queries; however, this ambitious approach appears to have led to an increase in creativity at the expense of factuality.\nThis could pose a big problem for OpenAI's ChatGPT, as rival services like [Google Gemini](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/google-gemini-update-brings-widgets-with-key-actions-for-android-and-ios/), [Anthropic Claude](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/25/anthropic-unveils-claude-3-7-first-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model/), have been designed to provide information more accurately. Unlike simpler models focused on high-confidence predictions, GPT o3 and o4-mini often speculate, blurring the line between possible scenarios and outright fabrications. This raises red flags for users in high-stakes environments, from legal professionals to educators and healthcare providers, where reliance on AI could lead to significant missteps.\nThe more useful AI becomes, the greater the potential for critical errors. While AI models may outperform humans in certain tasks, the risk of inaccuracies diminishes AI's overall credibility. Until these hallucination issues are effectively addressed, users are advised to approach AI-generated information with caution and skepticism.\nSource: [Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-is-getting-smarter-but-its-hallucinations-are-spiraling)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "In a recent announcement, [Rockstar Games](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/21/rockstar-games-announces-enhanced-graphics-and-performance-for-gta-5-on-pc/) confirmed a delay in the highly anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto 6, which resulted in a wave of mixed emotions among fans. To soften the blow, the studio has released a stunning new trailer that introduces the game's dual protagonists.\nPlayers will take on the roles of Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos, alongside a cast of intriguing supporting characters, each with their own criminal aspirations and backstories. Watch the [second GTA 6 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQRLujxTm3c) on Rockstar's YouTube channel.\nAs reported by [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/rockstar-just-dropped-a-ton-of-new-gta-6-details/), Rockstar has also posted a [teaser page](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI) which reveals more details about the game. Grand Theft Auto 6 is set in a fictional version of Florida, which is called Leonida. The map includes 6 regions: Vice City, Leonida Keys, Grassrivers, Port Gellhorn, Ambrosia, and Mount Kalaga National Park.\nVice City is based on Miami, which isn't a surprise as it has existed in prior games in the GTA franchise. According to [fans on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kg58kb/massive_amount_of_info_and_screenshots_on_gta_6/), Leonida Keys is similar to Florida Keys, Grassrivers is likely the Everglades. Port Gellhorn could be Tampa, while Ambrosia may be St. Augustine. Mount Kalaga National Park however seems to be something fictional which could have been created to provide some variety in the landscape.\nJason is a former military man who got entangled with the local drug trade in the Keys. Lucia is an ex-con seeking to turn her life around after a stint in prison. Their paths intertwine when a seemingly simple heist spirals out of control, setting the stage for unfolding chaos. Jason’s troubled history with grifters and crooks, coupled with Lucia’s determination to make smart choices post-incarceration, creates a compelling narrative foundation for players.\nThe supporting cast further enriches the narrative landscape. Characters like Cal Hampton, an online conspiracy theorist, and Boobie Ike, a street thug turned local entrepreneur who runs a multifaceted business empire, offer insights into the diverse world of crime that permeates the game's storyline. Dre'Quan Priest was a street hustler who wants to break into the music industry, and the professional bank robber, Raul Bautista, searches for talent willing to partake in high-stakes risks. Meanwhile, a notorious kingpin, Brian Heder looms large over the criminal underworld, maintaining his operation amid the chaos.\nThe new trailer has left viewers captivated with its striking visuals, who labelled it as \"the most visually stunning game\" yet, raising expectations even higher despite the delay. Rockstar's ability to weave together a rich tapestry of characters and plot lines suggests that the wait for GTA 6 may very well be worth it.\nFans from Florida have showered praise on the details in the game trailer and screenshots, saying that Leonida looks very accurate to the real Florida. Some keen-eyed fans also spotted how Jason's hair and facial hair differed in various scenes in the trailer, which seems to suggest that players will be able to customize their character's appearance.\nGrand Theft Auto VI will release on May 26, 2026, for [Xbox](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) Series S, X and [PlayStation 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/). It is unclear when the PC version will be launched. As the hype builds up for GTA 6, fans are left wondering what fresh surprises the final product will hold when it eventually arrives.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "When Microsoft announced the first batch of AI features in Windows last year, it did not introduce many Windows-specific AI features. The initial [integration of Copilot in Windows](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/07/02/microsoft-is-evolving-copilot-in-windows-11-by-downgrading-it/) supported a few basic options to make changes to Windows, but that was about it. Microsoft replaced this version of Copilot later on with a generic version that worked like the web version and did not support any Windows-specific features.\n[Recall](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/05/21/microsoft-announces-copilot-pcs-and-ai-powered-recall-feature/), Microsoft's big hope regarding AI in Windows backfired, as [privacy and security fears](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/06/14/the-end-of-windows-11s-recall-ai-feature-microsoft-postpones-launch/) forced Microsoft to go back to the drawing board.Now, [Recall is making a comeback](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/28/microsoft-is-rolling-out-recall-to-windows-11-copilot-pcs-via-an-optional-update/) and so are other AI features that are specific to Windows.\nOne of them was just [announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/05/06/introducing-a-new-generation-of-windows-experiences/), and it could pave the way for improve usability and administration of the operating system. Microsoft just announced the addition of an AI agent to Windows Settings.\n## AI agent in Windows Settings\nThe main idea here is to allow users to describe what they want to achieve using natural language. Say, you would like to increase the size of the font that Windows users to display text, or disable the annoying Copilot icon on the taskbar. Previously, you had to type a search term that matches the request, or locate the option manually.\nNow, at least on Copilot+ PCs, you can use natural language and Windows will guide you to finding the setting. Even better, Microsoft says that the agent can perform the action on your behalf, provided that you give it the green light to do so.\nMicrosoft writes: \"With this update to Settings, you will be able to simply describe what you need help with like, “how to control my PC by voice” or “my mouse pointer is too small” and the agent will recommend the right steps you can take to address the issue. With your permission and at your initiation, it can even complete the actions to change your settings on your behalf\".\nWriting \"Control my PC with voice\" or \"my text is too small\" will return the right setting on PCs that support the feature.\nHere is a short demo video that Microsoft published on YouTube that highlights the new feature:\nThe initial version of the AI agent is launching on Windows Insider Copilot+ PCs. It supports English only, but this is going to change in the future.\n### Closing Words\nThe appeal of AI in Windows was limited until now. The Copilot feature was the same that you got on the web, and there was not much else to be excited about up until now.\nThe new AI agent in Settings changes that. It adds a feature that Windows users will find useful, as it helps them find the right setting option. Clearly, this needs to work very well to be useful.\n_Now You: what is your take on this new AI feature in Windows? Would you like to see AI baked into other parts of the operating system? Feel free to leave a comment down below._\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader. The post [Finally!

A new class-action lawsuit was filed by law firm, Hagens Berman,\nThe plaintiff in the case is Pure Sweat Basketball Inc., a company that offers an app designed to help users improve their basketball skills. The lawsuit alleges that [Apple](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/24/eu-fines-apple-e500-million-and-meta-e200-million-under-digital-markets-act/) has penalized developers who wanted to use linked payment methods, by charging a [27% fee](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/01/17/apple-reforms-app-store-rules-to-allow-third-party-payment-methods-in-the-u-s-but-will-still-charge-a-commission-fee/) on all transactions. The company claims that it would have been able to directly sell subscriptions to its users if Apple had complied with the court’s injunction by allowing “link-out” buttons that direct customers to its website.\nHagens Berman estimates that more than 100,000 app developers have been impacted by Apple’s alleged misconduct, which forced them to accept Apple’s commissions on in-app sales.  \nApple reportedly only identified 34 developers who had applied to offer linked-out payments, this number represents a tiny portion of the approximately 136,000 developers operating within the App Store ecosystem.\nLast week, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued [an injunction](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/01/apple-faces-potential-criminal-contempt-for-willful-violation-of-injunction/) which prohibited Apple from charging commissions or otherwise interfering with developers' ability to redirect customers to external payment systems. The judge was also not pleased by the warning screens that Apple displayed when an app tried to take users to a third-party payment portal, and called these as scare tactics.\nAs [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/05/apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-for-violating-app-store-injunction/) points out, this is not the first time Hagens Berman has taken on Apple; the law firm previously led efforts against the company for anticompetitive practices, resulting in Apple making notable changes to its App Store operations and establishing a Small Developer Assistance Fund. Should the current lawsuit succeed, iOS developers who sold digital products through the App Store after January 16, 2024, may be eligible for reimbursement due to Apple’s alleged non-compliance with the injunction.\nIn response, Apple has voiced its disagreement with the ruling, and has filed an appeal. The result of this lawsuit and appeal could have significant implications for both developers and consumers.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The game has been titled Gears of War: Reloaded.\nGears of War was released in 2006 was developed by [Epic Games](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/10/08/court-orders-google-to-lift-restrictions-on-play-store-after-epic-games-antitrust-lawsuit/) and released as an [Xbox 360](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/08/19/microsoft-is-closing-the-xbox-360-store-in-2024-here-is-what-that-means/) exclusive. In 2015, [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/06/microsoft-enforces-strict-rules-for-bulk-emails-on-outlook/) released a remastered version called Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, which was developed by The Coalition, for Windows and Xbox One Consoles. The new remaster promises a modernized visual experience, breathing new life into the classic title that has captivated gamers since its original release. It comes with a plethora of enhancements such as 4K resolution, 60 FPS in Campaign, 120 FPS in Multiplayer, High Dynamic Range (HDR), Dolby Vision & 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos, 7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), 4K assets and remastered textures, Enhanced post-processing visual effects, Improved shadows and reflections, Super resolution with improved antialiasing, and Zero loading screens during Campaign. The system requirements for the game have not been revealed yet.\nThe big news, as [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-pc-ps5-summer-2025) reports, is Microsoft's new strategy to release games on Sony's [PlayStation 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/). Gears of War: Reloaded is launching simultaneously on [Windows](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/05/windows-11-24h2-update-is-available-for-all-users/) PC, [Xbox](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) and PlayStation 5 on August 26, 2025. Players will be able to team up with others across platforms, the game also supports cross-progression.\nSurprisingly, the game has been priced affordably at $39.99. Even more surprisingly, Microsoft has [confirmed](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/) that players who already own the digital version of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition will receive a free upgrade to the Reloaded version, rewarding those who have supported the series over the years. The game will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, ensuring subscribers have immediate access to the title upon launch.\nThe announcement of Gears of War: Reloaded was welcomed by the gaming community, but fans who were expecting multiple games from the series to be released together were a bit disappointed.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Microsoft has made a change to its email service to reduce spoofing, phishing, and spam activity. The new rules are designed to filter bulk [emails](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/01/gmails-new-feature-lets-you-react-to-emails-with-emojis/) that are sent to [Outlook](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/17/microsoft-confirms-classic-outlook-for-windows-has-a-high-cpu-usage-issue/) users, this will help reduce unwanted mails.\nCompanies and admins who send more than 5000 emails per day to Outlook addresses will need to adhere to the new authentication protocols. Senders must meticulously configure a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the domain's DNS record must specify which IP addresses/hosts that are authorized to send emails on their behalf. Additionally, Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) must be properly set up to sign messages, and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) must be published, ideally aligning with either SPF or DKIM records. Microsoft says Safe Sender list won’t be honored, i.e. an address that is marked as a safe sender will not be able to bypass the new enforcement.\n[Starting today](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefenderforoffice365blog/strengthening-email-ecosystem-outlook%e2%80%99s-new-requirements-for-high%e2%80%90volume-senders/4399730), any sender dispatching more than 5,000 emails per day without proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC will find their messages bouncing back rather than being directed to spam folders. In other words, if a sender fails to meet the new rules, the emails may not arrive in the recipient's inbox. These rules apply to Microsoft's Outlook consumer email service which supports Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, and Live.com. They don't apply to Enterprise users yet, but Microsoft is planning to expand the protections for all users eventually.\nThe rationale behind [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/05/microsoft-removes-authenticator-app-feature-to-promote-microsoft-edge/)'s stringent measures is to combat the ever-growing threats of spam, spoofing, and phishing. [Beta News](https://betanews.com/2025/05/05/microsoft-email-blocks-start-may-2025/) writes that while the intentions are laudable, the implications for marketers and publishers could be severe, because those who rely on mass email campaigns may find their outreach significantly hindered unless they ensure compliance with these authentication standards. Even newsletters could be affected\nThese guidelines may appear straightforward, but the reality is more complex. Issues such as outdated mailing lists, broken unsubscribe links, and excessive DNS lookups can jeopardize email delivery. Failure to adapt to could silence otherwise legitimate communications, leading to an unsettling effect across numerous industries dependent on effective email outreach. In this evolving digital world, remaining informed and proactive is paramount.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Microsoft Authenticator is a free security application by Microsoft. Its main function is the generation of security codes for two-factor authentication to better protect online accounts such as [your eBay account](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/11/18/protect-your-ebay-account-with-authenticator-apps/). Microsoft extended functionality in the past so that users could also save passwords for apps or websites in Authenticator to have them autofilled when prompted.\nThis particular feature is going away, [according](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/changes-to-microsoft-authenticator-autofill-09fd75df-dc04-4477-9619-811510805ab6) to a Microsoft support article.\n**The details** :\n  * Starting June 2025, Microsoft Authenticator users will no longer be able to save new passwords in the application.\n  * From July 2025 onward, autofill functionality is removed and no longer available.\n  * In August 2025, saved passwords are no longer accessible in the Authenticator app.\n\n\n**In other words:** Microsoft is removing the option to store password in Authenticator and have them autofilled in the coming months.\nMicrosoft argues that this is for the better, as it is streamlining the process of saving passwords and providing autofill functionality. You may ask yourself how that is possible. According to Microsoft, it is simple: all existing passwords get synced with the Microsoft account, and users may then access them when they us Microsoft Edge.\nWhile the easy-part may very well be true for users who run Microsoft Edge anywhere, it is not the case for users who do not. Microsoft seems to be aware, as it explains on the support page how to install Microsoft Edge and make it a service provider on mobile for passwords autofills.\nAuthenticator users who do not use Edge on the platform that they use the app on are put between a rock and a hard place. Want to continue having access to your saved passwords and autofill? Then it is Edge you need, according to Microsoft. You also need to make Edge an autofill provider on your mobile.\n**So, is this really streaminling the process?** With Authenticator available on multiple platforms,you already had the option to use the app different devices. Admittedly, the option to sync data was not as sophisticated as some of the other apps in the vertical, but Microsoft could have also made the decision to improve Authenticator and bolster its sync feature.\n## Exporting Microsoft Authenticator passwords\nAuthenticator users may export their passwords to a CSV file. Many password managers support CSV files so that all saved passwords can be imported into them.\nFirst, here is how you export the passwords:\n  1. Open Microsoft Authenticator.\n  2. Select Menu > Settings.\n  3. Scroll down until you come to the Autofill section.\n  4. Activate \"Export Passwords\".\n  5. Select the Export option when prompted.\n  6. Type the screen lock password.\n\n\n**Note** : The passwords are stored in clear text in the file. Anyone with access can read all your passwords, It is highly recommended to delete the file after the import was successful. Also do not save it in a remote location, e.g, a cloud space.\nYou could import them in the open source password manager Bitwarden. You may also use the [app to import two-factor codes](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/06/14/bitwarden-authenticator-now-lets-you-import-totp-tokens-from-other-authenticator-apps/) from other apps, but Microsoft Authenticator does not appear to be supported directly.\n### Closing words\nIt remains to be seen whether Microsoft's attempt at streamlining the saving of passwords and password autofill pays off, or if users may move away from Authenticator to use a different app for the task instead.\n**Now you:** what is your take on this? Do you use an Authenticator app for generating login codes? Feel free to let everyone know in the comments below.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "The [Windows 11 24H2 update](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/09/17/exclusive-microsoft-announces-release-of-windows-11-24h2-feature-update/) is now broadly available for users. Microsoft took its time to delay the rollout to fix various issues that have been plaguing the latest version since it was released in last year.\nHowever, Microsoft believes it is stable, and [stated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24H2) that this release is part of the final phase of deployment. Despite its wide availability, some people may not see the update.\nPCs that have Windows 11 Home and Pro editions will be updated to Windows 11 24H2 automatically, these include computers that are running versions 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2. The only exceptions to this are endpoints managed by IT departments. Computers that currently have a compatibility issue due to unresolved hardware or software conflicts will also not receive the update just yet. For example, Microsoft [blocked the update](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/26/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-24h2-update-due-to-audio-compatibility-issues/) on PCs with Dirac Audio software because of some audio issues. In case of such problems, users will be stuck on 23H2, until the issues are sorted out, and version 24H2 is made available for their PCs.\nUsers can manually check for the update from the Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates.\nSome reports claim that the Windows 11 24H2 update downloads automatically in the background, and that a notification will pop up to inform the user that the new version is ready for installation. But there is not enough evidence to suggest that it happens to all users.\nUsers who wish to block the update will need to edit a group policy, or use a third-party tool such as [InControl](https://www.ghacks.net/2022/02/16/take-control-of-windows-updating-and-upgrading-with-incontrol/) to prevent a forced update.\nAs Windows 11 users prepare for version 24H2, some are apprehensive due to the bugs and complaints reported in prior phases. Users had reported [incompatibility with games](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/11/25/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-24h2-update-on-pcs-with-star-wars-outlaws-and-assassins-creed/), loss of data due to [Bitlocker encryption](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/08/13/the-windows-security-updates-of-august-2024-are-now-available-bitlocker-recovery-issue-fixed/), and more. But Microsoft appears to be confident that the necessary improvements have been made to warrant a widespread rollout.\nSource: [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-windows-11-24h2-download-is-now-available-for-everyone/)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Nvidia launched its latest [RTX 5060 Ti](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/08/nvidia-could-launch-mobile-variants-of-rtx-5050-and-rtx-5060-within-2-weeks/) graphics cards last month. But the 8GB model is said to suffer from a major flaw.\nA report by [Computer Base](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-8-gb-test.92401/) reveals performance disparities in the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti. In benchmarks across 27 titles at 1440p resolution, the RTX 5060 Ti with 8GB averaged 59.4 FPS on a PCIe 5.0 motherboard, and 55.82 FPS on a PCIe 4.0 setup. While these figures may initially seem satisfactory, the results masked significant performance dips in specific games, with eight titles reporting drops of 5 FPS or more in both average and 1% low FPS metrics.\n[Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-8gb-loses-up-to-10-percent-performance-when-using-pcie-4-0) notes that this is in stark contrast to the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB model, which many reviewers have praised for its performance. Experts have attributed the 8GB version's struggles to insufficient VRAM, which has raised concerns even at lower resolutions.\nDevelopers are increasingly optimizing their titles for demanding hardware, which puts users with limited memory at a disadvantage. With GPU buyers often coming from older systems that might not support PCIe 5.0, upgrading to the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB could lead to unsatisfactory performance for those expecting a substantial boost in gaming experiences.\nMany reviewers now caution against investing in graphics cards with 8GB of VRAM or less. For gamers who are prioritizing future-proofing and optimal performance, investing in graphics cards equipped with at least 12GB of VRAM is highly advisable.\nNvidia's latest GPUs have drawn criticism for its prices and performance problems. The RTX 5060 Ti just adds to the list of issues. Many PC gamers are sticking to their existing GPUs, while those building new computers are opting to buy previous-gen hardware. The rising tariffs also pose a problem for gaming. Nintendo announced that its games for the [Switch 2](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-versions/) could cost up to $90, and Microsoft is also increasing the price of Xbox games. Both Sony and Microsoft have hiked the prices of the [PlayStation 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/) and [Xbox Series](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) consoles, respectively.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

This decision was [announced](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/skype-is-retiring-in-may-2025-what-you-need-to-know-2a7d2501-427f-485e-8be0-2068a9f90472) at the end of February.\nSkype was once so popular that Microsoft acquired it for $8.5 Billion in 2011. But the voice over IP (VoIP) platform struggled in the decade to follow. It lost a huge chunk of its user base to other services, which offered better features across platforms.\nThe emergence of [FaceTime](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/10/17/how-to-disable-reactions-in-facetime-on-ios-ipados-and-macos/), [Zoom](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/08/08/zoom-clips-launched/), [WhatsApp](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/29/whatsapp-web-set-to-launch-voice-and-video-calling-features/), and Facebook's [Messenger](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/21/how-to-block-meta-ai-from-using-your-instagram-or-facebook-posts-for-training/) practically spelt the end of Skype. [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-increases-prices-for-xbox-consoles-accessories-and-new-game-releases/) itself began focusing on its other instant communication app, Teams, and launched a [free version](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/08/21/teams-microsoft-launches-unified-app-for-everyone-to-end-two-version-chaos/) of the tool.\nWhile users can no longer use Skype for communication, Microsoft has given users a couple of choices, you could either choose to switch to the free version of Microsoft Teams. This allows users to import all their data including chats, group chats, message history and contacts over to Teams. To add to this, users can log in to Teams using their Skype credentials.\nSkype users who don't want to switch to Teams, can export their data, including all their chats and photos, using an [official tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/how-do-i-export-or-delete-my-skype-data-84546e00-2fef-4c45-8ef6-3a27f83242cc) that is available on Microsoft's support portal. The good news is that Microsoft hasn't deleted your Skype data yet. You have until January 2026 to make your choice, after which you will no longer be able to access your Skype data.\nHowever, there are some exceptions to the migration:\n  * Chats between Skype users and Teams work or school accounts will not be migrated. Users can use Teams Free to start a new conversation with Teams work or school users and enjoy even more functionality.\n  * Skype to Skype for Business chat history will not be migrated.\n  * 1:1 chat with self history will not be migrated.\n  * Private conversations data will not be migrated.\n  * Copilot and bots content will not be supported in Teams Free and no chat history will be available.\n\n\nMicrosoft is no longer allowing users to purchase Skype Subscriptions, Skype Numbers and Skype Credit. Existing credits will be honored via Microsoft Teams until the next renewal period.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The Xbox price hike follows Sony's [PlayStation 5 price hike](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/), which was announced a few weeks ago.\nThe Xbox Series S 512GB model costs $379.99, up from $299.99, while the 1TB model costs $429.99, after a $50 increase from $349.99. Shockingly, the Xbox Series X Digital edition is $100 more expensive than its launch price of $449.99, it is now available for $549.99. The Xbox Series X has also had a $100 price hike, it will retail for $599.99, up from $499.99. Microsoft says that the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition, which was previously priced at $599.99, now costs $729.99.\nThe Xbox price increase in Europe and the United Kingdom are as follows: The Xbox Series S 512GB model costs £299.99 / €349.99, up by £50 / €50. The Xbox Series X's new price is £499.99 / €599.99, which is an increase of £20 / €50. The 2TB Xbox Series X has had a £40 or €50 price hike to £589.99 / €699.99.\nHere are the new Xbox prices for Australia: Xbox Series S 512 - AU$549.00, Xbox Series S 1TB - AU $599.00, Xbox Series X Digital - AU $749.00, Xbox Series X - AU $849.00, Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - AU $1,049.00.\nMicrosoft has [confirmed](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates) that the prices of Xbox games will increase to $80 in the future. Existing games are not impacted by the increase. [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide) reports that this change would apply to physical and digital versions. [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsofts-bing-gains-momentum-as-google-sees-decline-in-market-share/) has also announced a price increase for some Xbox accessories, including some controllers, headsets, etc.\nThis is what Microsoft told [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday): “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”\nGamers have [criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kc86tx/microsoft_raises_the_price_of_all_xbox_series/) Sony and Microsoft for increasing the prices of hardware that is 5 years old. Many fans argued that this was a poor decision by Microsoft, given that Xbox is already well behind PlayStation in terms of sales revenue. Nintendo recently announced that some [Switch 2 games](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-versions/) could cost $80 or $90.\nUltimately, such price increases only hurt the consumer, as they never go back down to the previous price.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Microsoft Bing's usage is gaining popularity among users. The company has to thank [Copilot](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/28/microsoft-is-rolling-out-recall-to-windows-11-copilot-pcs-via-an-optional-update/) for its growth.\nAccording to [Microsoft](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/02/microsoft-68-percent-of-users-who-sign-in-with-passwords-fail/)'s FY25 Q3 earnings report, there was a significant focus on cloud services and artificial intelligence, with notable highlights including a 22% year-over-year growth in Bing's engagement rates. Powered by [ChatGPT](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/30/openai-expands-chatgpt-search-with-shopping-features/) and other OpenAI technologies, Microsoft Copilot is deeply integrated with Bing Search, enabling the tool to provide real-time information to users, enhancing the overall search experience.\nGoogle had initially failed to capitalize on the AI trend, and it may cost it dearly. [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#yearly-2009-2025) reports that Google's usage share has fallen below 90% of the global, currently standing at 89.9%. As [Tuta](https://tuta.com/blog/google-search-dominance-drops) points out, approximately 5.56 Billion people use the internet. This means that the measly 1% could be 50 million users, which is actually a significant number. This is not the first time that Google has dropped below 90% market share. In October 2024 Google Search's market share dropped to 89.34%, but it managed to climb back up to 89.99% in November, but dropped back to 89.73 in December. [Something similar](https://searchengineland.com/google-search-market-share-drops-2024-450497) happened in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe decline in Google’s market share may not stem from a singular cause but rather a culmination of various factors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that users are increasingly searching for viable alternatives like such as [Ecosia](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/04/23/ecosia-browser-released-for-windows-and-macos/), and [DuckDuckGo](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/02/16/duckduckgo-browser-now-supports-password-and-bookmark-syncing-across-devices/) due to growing concerns over Google’s monopolistic practices, which have come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. [Antitrust cases](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/10/doj-pushes-for-google-to-sell-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly/) in the U.S. are raising questions about the company's control over services like [Google Chrome](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/23/openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome-from-google/) and [Android](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/28/android-16-advanced-protection-will-prevent-usb-based-attacks/), potentially leading to significant changes in its operational structure. Other factors that may have impacted Google's decline include antitrust regulations in some regions that forced the search giant to offer alternative search engine options like Microsoft Bing.\nBing and other search engines may not be able to unseat Google from its dominant position that easily, but the current trends may present Microsoft with a rare opportunity. As more users look for alternatives, Bing powered by Copilot is positioned to capitalize on this shift, should Google’s decline continue. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining if Bing can pivot these gains into sustained growth in the highly competitive search engine market.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

At other times, you may need to reset the password to regain access to your account.\nCyber criminals may have a better chance at signing in to some accounts than users, especially if the [top 200 common passwords](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/11/14/worlds-top-200-common-passwords-continue-to-be-incredibly-weak/) are used.\nMicrosoft [revealed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/) today that 68 percent of all password sign ins fail. In other words, only 32 percent of all Microsoft users manage to sign in when they are prompted to do so when they use passwords.\nPart of the reason, according to Microsoft, is that users have to enter complex characters or one-time codes to sign in with passwords.\n[Passkeys](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/05/03/microsoft-introduces-passkeys-support-for-consumer-accounts/) offer a much better success chance, says Microsoft. Users who sign in with passkeys manage to do so successfully 98 percent of the time. The number of accounts with passkeys is rising by about 1 million passkeys per day.\nMicrosoft revealed the information in an article that it published on its Security blog. In \"Pushing passkeys forward: Microsoft’s latest updates for simpler, safer sign-ins\", Microsoft highlighted plans to get more of its users to use passkeys for sign ins.\nHere are the three main changes:\n  * **New Microsoft accounts are \"passwordless by default\".** Microsoft says that new users have multiple options for securely signing into their accounts without passwords.\n  * **Changes in preferred sign-in options.** Microsoft plans to display the \"best available method\" to sign in to users. Users may also get a prompt to enroll a passkey and this will be the preferred option afterwards.\n  * **New visual sign in experience that prioritizes passwordless methods of signing in and signing up**.\n\n\nMicrosoft users may create a passkey on [this Microsoft website](https://aka.ms/addproof). Please note that Microsoft has not yet enabled passkeys support for signing into Windows.\n### Passkeys issues\nWhile passkeys promise better security, especially against password-based attacks, they suffer from a variety of issues currently. Here is a list of some of the major ones:\n  * Limited compatibility, not every site or application supports passkeys.\n  * Cross-platform use is often complicated due to vendor lock-in.\n  * Account recovery is often not straightforward, and may rely on traditional recovery means, e.g., via email.\n  * Syncing between a user's devices is not always supported, or complicated.\n\n\n_Now You: what is your take on passkeys? Do you use them already to secure some accounts or apps? Or do you prefer not to? Feel free to leave a comment down below._\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The release features the new profile manager that has been in development for some time.\nThe point update to Firefox 138.0.1 comes as a surprise. It is uncommon for a non-security update to be released shortly after another release of the web browser. In the case of non-security updates, it is usually a major problem that needs fixing right away.\n**First, the details:**\n  * Firefox 138.0.1 is already available for download.\n  * It fixes a saving issue on the Microsoft domains office.com and live.com.\n  * The second fix resolves a new tab and home page issue that showed the pages as blank.\n\n\nMozilla lists two issues in the [official release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/138.0.1/releasenotes/).\n**Fixed an issue which caused a blank page to be shown for Home and New Tab pages for some users**\nSome Firefox users noticed that the new tab page or home page of the browser would not display content after upgrading to Firefox 138.0. The number of affected users is unclear, but users reported the issue on sites like Reddit as well and not only to Mozilla's [bug tracking service](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1963537).\nThe issue seems to have come from a change that Mozilla made in Firefox 138, namely, turning the new tab page functionality [into an add-on](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1949511).\n**Added a workaround for a bug in outlook.office.com/outlook.live.com where attachment filenames are incorrectly prefixed with UTF-8 when saved**\nThe second issue occurred on the Microsoft domains office.com and live.com. Users who saved attachments on these domains would notice that each saved file had the prefix UTF-8 attached to its filename.\nMozilla describes the bug in detail on the [official bug tracking website](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1961710). Firefox fixed the issue by adding \"a webcompat intervention for Outlook\" to fix the filenames of downloaded attachments.\n## How to obtain the update to Firefox 138.0.1\nMost Firefox installations receive updates automatically. This is the case for all non-managed Firefox installations by default. Desktop users may speed up the installation of the update by selecting Menu > Help > About Firefox.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

This change aims to make email communication feel more like chatting on popular messaging platforms such as [Google Chat](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/07/04/is-google-chat-copying-whatsapp-with-these-features/), [WhatsApp](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/29/whatsapp-web-set-to-launch-voice-and-video-calling-features/), [Telegram](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/24/australia-penalizes-telegram-for-failing-to-timely-address-child-exploitation-and-extremist-content-queries/), etc.\nGoogle [explained](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/04/emoji-reactions-in-gmail.html) that the introduction of emoji reactions is designed to help users quickly respond, recognize receipt of an email, and share emotions in a manner that circumvents the conventional email etiquette. In other words, it streamlines interactions, particularly in mass email threads allowing for quick acknowledgments without the need to reply to it, and also lets them express their feelings freely.\nFor example, you could use a gratitude emoji to thank a teammate, vote for a team dinner with a food emoji, or congratulate someone for reaching a milestone with a celebratory emoji.\nHowever, it’s important to note that the feature is deactivated by default, probably because not everyone may like the option. Administrators can restrict the feature in their organization. The setting is available in the Admin console > Apps > Gmail > End User Access > Emoji reactions.\nUsers who are not utilizing Gmail, those with conversation view disabled, or individuals using outdated versions of the Gmail app may face some limitations. [Google](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/01/more-details-emerge-about-googles-child-friendly-gemini-ai-app-for-kids/) has published a [support document](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14080429?) to outline the feature, and issues that users may encounter with it. [Emoji reactions](https://www.ghacks.net/how-to-add-emoji-reactions-during-a-google-meet/) will appear as separate emails formatted to indicate the reaction. This slight hiccup could impact seamless communication across different platforms, potentially stalling the feature's full rollout.\nThe emoji reactions will gradually become available across all Google Workspace accounts, individual subscribers, and personal Google accounts, starting with rapid release domains and scheduled release domains beginning on May 13, 2025.\nSource: [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmail-will-now-let-you-react-to-emails-with-emojis)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Recently, a report [revealed](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/02/gemini-for-kids-googles-upcoming-ai-chatbot-tailored-for-young-users/) that Google may soon release a child-friendly artificial intelligence version of its [Gemini AI](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/30/samsung-galaxy-a-series-phones-to-get-a-gemini-button/) assistant. Now, more details have emerged about the app.\nThe Kids version of the chatbot is reportedly tailored specifically for children under 13. [9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2025/04/28/gemini-app-kids/) reports that an email sent by [Google](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/29/google-one-may-soon-let-you-backup-and-restore-your-esim-data/) to parents contained information about how the app could help them. The new Gemini app aims to assist children with tasks such as homework, asking questions and creating stories, allowing for a safer interaction with AI technology at a formative age. Gemini for Kids will be accessible on [Android](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/28/android-16-advanced-protection-will-prevent-usb-based-attacks/), [iOS](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/17/meta-didnt-want-apple-intelligence-in-its-apps-for-ios/) and on the web, and can be set as the default assistant on Android devices.\nWhile the concept of introducing AI tools into children’s daily lives may seem progressive, it comes with inherent risks. Concerns about the potential for Gemini to misinform children or hinder their development of critical thinking skills have surfaced. Google has taken some precautions to suggest that controlled exposure will allow kids to learn how to engage with AI responsibly, while the company encourages parents to verify the information provided by Gemini.\nGoogle advises parents to teach their children how to double-check responses, and to avoid entering sensitive or personal info in Gemini. It also warned that while there are measures to limit access to inappropriate content, they may not be perfect, and that there is a risk of encountering such content. The company also highlighted the importance of teaching children that Gemini is an AI, not human, and that it can’t think for itself or feel emotions, even though it may talk like a real person.\n[TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/google-is-working-on-a-gemini-ai-app-for-kids) says that Google has promised that the app will not feature any advertisements or data collection, addressing several privacy concerns that parents could have. Furthermore, the app will incorporate features from Google's [Family Link](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/03/16/google-family-link-for-android-more-control-over-your-kids-devices/), empowering parents to monitor their child's activity and set appropriate limits on usage.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Apple has been dealt a major blow in its [lawsuit](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/04/25/apple-wins-antitrust-suit-against-epic-games/) versus Epic Games. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said the tech giant had violated the law as an executive lied under oath about its App Store practices.\nA US federal court had imposed an [injunction](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/01/17/apple-reforms-app-store-rules-to-allow-third-party-payment-methods-in-the-u-s-but-will-still-charge-a-commission-fee/) in 2021, that was designed to curb Apple's anticompetitive practices in the [App Store](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/28/apple-updates-app-store-age-ratings-and-enhances-child-account-setup-for-improved-safety/), asking it to allow alternate ways to download apps and third-party payment methods. An 80-page court order states that Apple has intentionally undermined the injunction’s goals by implementing new fees and obstacles that continue to suppress competition. In light of these findings, the judge sanctioned Apple for defying the order. The case has also been referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for potential criminal contempt proceedings against Apple.\nInternal documents revealed during the proceedings suggested a deliberate strategy by Apple to maintain control over its revenue, with Apple’s Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, found to have lied under oath. [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-sanctioned-for-defying-court-order-over-app-store-rules/) reports that Phil Schiller had recommended compliance, but CEO Tim Cook opted to side with the finance team, disregarding the court's orders. Judge Gonzalez Rogers emphasized that Apple's use of deceptive \"scare screens\" and static URLs aimed to suppress user transition to more competitive payment methods.\nThe court’s ruling comes amid an ongoing legal battle with Epic Games, which originally sued Apple in 2020, challenging its restrictive app store policies. Apple has been banned from charging its previously imposed 27% commission on external purchases, and directed the company to stop hindering developers from promoting alternative payment options. Apple strongly disagreed with the court's decision, but has stated that it will comply with the order and appeal the ruling.\nEpic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, lauded the ruling as a major victory, labeling Apple's policies as an illegal “tax” on developers. Last year, Fortnite made a comeback in Europe, but only in Europe, through [Epic Games' Mobile App Store](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/03/21/epic-games-store-is-coming-to-ios-and-android/) which was made possible because of the Digital Markets Act. Now other fans can rejoice, Fortnite is returning to iOS after a 5-year hiatus, Epic Games' CEO confirmed that his company is planning to release the game on the U.S. App Store next week.\nDespite his vocal criticism of Apple, Sweeney seemed to be willing to put things behind by saying, “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”\nThe ruling marks a turning point in the ongoing confrontation between Apple and developers pushing for fairer practices in the digital marketplace. With the court backing developers’ calls for change, Apple’s current App Store policies may face a broader reevaluation in the wake of this legal challenge. Apple was hit with a [€500 Million](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/24/eu-fines-apple-e500-million-and-meta-e200-million-under-digital-markets-act/) fine by the European Commission for violating the DMA.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Google has just released Chrome 136, a new stable version of its web browser for desktop and mobile. The new version is 136.0.7103.59 on Linux, 136.0.7103.60 on Android, and 136.0.7103.48/49 on Windows and Mac devices.\nYou can check out our coverage of [Chrome 135's release here](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/02/chrome-135-is-out-with-security-updates-and-new-features/), in case you missed it or want to look at the major changes again.\n## Chrome 136: security update\nThe new version of the browser patches eight security issues. Google lists four of those on the official [Chrome Releases blog](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_29.html). The aggregate severity rating is high and Google does not mention active exploits.\nSecurity issues are patched in HTML and the Developer Tools. The four unmentioned security issues were discovered internally.\n### Other changes\n**Android APK download checks**\nThe big change in Chrome 136 introduces malicious APK checks in Chrome for Android. The feature submits information about APK file downloads to Google to find out if the files include malicious code.\nChrome 136 is set to collect telemetry about the process only at this time. Google notes, however, that future versions will show warnings and block downloads of malicious APK files in Chrome automatically to \"protect users against mobile malware\".\nFurthermore, checks are currently only performed if users have enabled Enhanced Protection in Google Safe Browsing.\n**Partitioning against Browser history leaks**\nAnother highlight is the new partitioning of the visited links history. Browser history leaks have been a problem for a long time. In 2018, for instance, researchers [found a loophole](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/11/04/browser-history-sniffing-is-still-a-thing/) that allowed them to find out if a particular site was visited by a user.\nThe :visited anchor element is now restricted. It is only used if it has \"been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before\". In other words, sites can only check visited if the link was clicked previously on the site itself.\nGoogle says: \"By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, the many side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain :visited links styling information are now obsolete, as they no longer provide sites with new information about users\".\n### Closing Words\nGoogle Chrome is already available. Most non-managed installations should be updated automatically. You can speed things up by selecting Menu > Help > About Google Chrome. This should download and install the new update immediately on the system.\n_Now You: what is your take on the new release? Do you find the new security features useful?

    "content": "OpenAI is rolling out new shopping features for [ChatGPT Search](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/12/19/chatgpt-search-is-now-available-for-free-users/), primarily to assist users with their purchases. The search engine, which debuted last year, has been gaining popularity on a steady basis.\n[OpenAI](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/23/openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome-from-google/) says that it saw 1 billion web searches on [ChatGPT](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/25/chatgpt-deep-research-is-now-available-for-free-users-with-some-limitations/) in the last week alone. The chatbot is used by millions of users who access it to research about various things, including products that they like to buy. But, ChatGPT did not offer the same experience that a user would get on Google Search. This is something that the company has addressed with its latest update.\nChatGPT now displays improved product results with visual details which is fairly similar to the product cards that you see on [Google](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/08/google-brings-multimodal-search-to-ai-mode-with-enhanced-visual-search/), Bing, etc. It shows the images, and pricing of the product, and also shows star-ratings aka user reviews for the product from popular sites like [Amazon](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/21/amazon-is-set-to-launch-linux-based-vega-os-for-its-tvs-to-replace-fire-os/), Best Buy, Reddit, to help you decide whether it could be worth buying. In addition to this, ChatGPT Search's shopping feature also includes direct links to buy the product that you queried about.\nOpenAI's product lead, Adam Fry, told [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/656729/openai-chatgpt-search-shopping) that these results don't have any ads and that the results are not sponsored. The design resembles Google's product cards, because it is a format that users are familiar with. OpenAI is working with partners to show up-to-date prices, though it is unclear who these partners are. While a demo of the feature, featured in the screenshot, seems impressive, the actual results could vary.\nThe AI-powered search engine reportedly failed to deliver accurate information about [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-launches-on-june-5-starting-at-449/), and worryingly, also displayed results from some rather unscrupulous sources, and also included an overpriced eBay listing, likely from a scalper. This indicates that the feature still needs refinement.\nChatGPT's shopping improvements are rolling out to Plus, Pro, Free, and logged-out users everywhere.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "Samsung has officially announced that some of its Galaxy A series phones will get a quick way to access [Gemini](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/18/google-gemini-live-video-and-screen-sharing-features-are-now-free-for-all-android-users/). Users will be able to launch Google's AI-powered assistant, by pressing and holding the side button, aka the power button.\nThe company says that the feature will be available with an update for some devices, and that it will include more AI-goodies such as Samsung Awesome Intelligence. This is technically a watered-down version of Galaxy AI that supports [Circle to Search](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/28/googles-circle-to-search-to-get-text-interactions-in-ai-overviews/), AI Select, Read Aloud, Object Eraser, and other AI-powered features. Samsung wants to make the Galaxy A series feel similar to its flagship [Galaxy S series](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/23/samsung-unveils-galaxy-s25-series-with-advanced-ai-and-top-tier-specs/), by adding such AI improvements.\nThe South Korean company has partnered with [Google](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/29/google-one-may-soon-let-you-backup-and-restore-your-esim-data/) to provide these enhancements to help users to activate Gemini faster, and more naturally through a simple gesture that brings intelligent support into the flow of daily tasks. [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-a-series-set-to-get-a-quick-access-gemini-button) reports that Samsung is pushing to replace its own virtual assistant, [Bixby](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/02/22/how-to-use-bixby-text-call-new-one-ui-5-1-feature-explained/), in favor of the more-popular Google Gemini.\nRecently, a Samsung executive had recently admitted that the company had agreed to a monetary partnership with Google to pre-include the search giant's software on its phones. This was brought up during the U.S. Department of Justice's [antitrust case vs Google,](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/23/openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome-from-google/) to highlight how the company uses its financial power to dominate the market, and prevents other services from attracting users.\nThe Gemini button shortcut will be delivered via an update starting with the Galaxy A56 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A26 5G phones that were launched last month. Samsung is aiming to roll out the feature in early May. Other devices that will get the Gemini button shortcut include the Galaxy A55 5G, A54 5G, A35 5G, A34 5G, A25 5G, A25e 5G and A24 running One UI 7.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "AdGuard has announced the availability of its ad blocker for [Linux](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/23/wine-10-0-launches-with-enhanced-compatibility-for-windows-apps-on-linux/) operating systems. The Cyprus-based company had initially released a nightly version last month, but it has now been released to stable channel.\nThe update brings more options to the tool, including support for SOCKS5 and HTTP proxy modes. While it retains many of its primary features, AdGuard v1.0 for Linux differs from the Windows and macOS versions greatly, and that's because it does not have a GUI. The Linux version is designed to be used with the command line.\n[AdGuard](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/12/20/adguard-mail-email-alias-and-temp-email-service-from-the-makers-of-the-adblocker/) lets you selectively route HTTPS traffic from certain apps, to bypass the ad blocking filters when you don't need it. The utility comes with two pre-built lists of browsers and apps to be excluded from HTTPS filtering. Users can use the terminal editor or a [text editor](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/10/07/how-to-restore-the-wordpad-text-editor-in-windows-11/) to customize these lists, by editing the proxy.yaml for app exclusions and browsers.yaml for browser exclusions.\nTraffic can be filtered on a per-app basis. AdGuard also allows users to use their own rules for filtering ads, an option to add filters from the AdGuard list or install custom filters via URL, and the ability to enable, disable or remove a filter. The app has a set-up wizard that guides users through the configuration process step-by-step. Optionally, users can choose to set it up using the config file method.\nAdGuard for Linux uses a different method to update filters, instead of downloading the entire list, it will only download the changes that were made to a list since the previous update. In other words, it uses a differential filter update. The company says that this will consume less traffic to update and filters will be updated faster than ever, to ensure that users always have the latest versions to block advertisements accurately.\nUsers can install AdGuard for Linux using this command: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI/release/install.sh | sh -s -- -v\nFor further details, please read the instructions available on [AdGuard's website](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-v1-0-for-linux.html).\nFor those looking for a streamlined and effective [ad-blocking](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/18/google-pushing-ad-blockers-violate-youtubes-terms-of-service-banners-on-youtube/) solution on Linux, AdGuard 1.0 marks a substantial step forward in functionality, proving that sometimes less indeed is more.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "content": "WhatsApp Web is poised to gain a major update to its functionality by potentially introducing voice and video calling capabilities directly from the browser. Currently, users are limited to sending messages and sharing media through the web client, as real-time audio and video communication requires the installation of the [WhatsApp](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/24/whatsapp-introduces-advanced-chat-privacy-to-improve-user-security/) desktop application.\nThe evolution of [WhatsApp Web](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/04/25/whatsapp-web-different-features/) has been noteworthy, but the absence of voice and video call support has been a prominent limitation, when compared to the competition. WhatsApp had recently changed the way how one can start a call in beta versions, users can tap a call button in group chats, which defaults to a video call, but there is an option to switch to a voice call. Personal chats display both voice and video call buttons. Such improvements were normally designed for WhatsApp's mobile apps, and later added to the desktop program.\nHowever, according to a leak by [WABetaInfo](https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-bringing-voice-and-video-calling-capabilities-to-the-web-client/), development for these eagerly anticipated features are underway. Once rolled out, users will be able to initiate voice and video calls directly from popular browsers such as [Chrome](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/23/openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome-from-google/), [Firefox](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/29/firefox-138-launches-with-improved-profile-management-and-security-updates/), Safari, and [Edge](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/22/microsoft-edge-ai-is-taking-over-the-new-tab-page/), without the need for the dedicated desktop app. This improvement could be particularly useful for those who require seamless communication across devices, allowing for a more versatile user experience. Whether in the office, at home, or on the go, WhatsApp Web users would no longer face the inconvenience of switching between applications for calls.\nAdding this feature would also elevate WhatsApp's position as a vital communication tool in today’s digital landscape. WhatsApp's commitment to the web version of its service is impressive, as it could have opted to keep the features locked away behind the standalone app. While exact details regarding the rollout are yet to be clarified, some people are speculating that an announcement may not be too far away.\nSource: [Beta News](https://betanews.com/2025/04/29/whatsapp-on-the-web-is-getting-voice-and-video-calling/), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/657336/whatsapp-voice-video-call-buttons-web-client)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

It may soon let users backup their eSIM data to the cloud.\nUnlike physical SIM cards which can be transferred easily to a different phone, it is not easy to migrate an eSIM. [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-sim-backup-apk-teardown-3548643/) has discovered some code strings in the beta version 25.16.33 of [Google Play Services](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/18/google-rolls-out-auto-restart-feature-for-enhanced-security-on-android/), and for the first time, \"SIMs\" have been identified as a category of data eligible for backup.\nThe refreshed device backup settings page also lists other retrievable data types such as contacts, call history, and apps. While this new functionality has not yet been activated, it suggests that Google is preparing to support backing up eSIM information, mirroring existing services from [Apple](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/24/eu-fines-apple-e500-million-and-meta-e200-million-under-digital-markets-act/) and [Samsung](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/23/samsung-unveils-galaxy-s25-series-with-advanced-ai-and-top-tier-specs/) that allow users to convert physical SIM cards into on-device eSIMs. Currently, there are no options in place for backing up SIM cards on Android, which highlights the significance of this anticipated update.\nDespite the promise these features hold, it remains unclear whether it would make it to the public release. Experts speculate that this enhancement could arrive in the near future, but Google is yet to reveal any details. The drawback is that this eSIM backup feature would likely be integrated into the [Google One](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/02/08/google-ai-gemini-advanced-and-google-one-ai-launch/) service, which would necessitate a paid subscription for users who wish to utilize it.\nShould it be implemented, the ability to backup and restore eSIM information could streamline the transition process for users who want to switch to a new device. This could also be useful if a user does not have the old device in hand, e.g. in case it broke or got lost.\nVia: [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-might-eventually-back-up-your-phone-sims-for-easy-restoration).\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

Nightreign also has a reduced storage requirement, needing only 30GB compared to the original's 60GB.\n### **Minimum Specifications**\n  * Operating System: Windows 10\n  * Processor: Intel Core i5-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500\n  * Memory: 12GB RAM\n  * Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB or AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB\n  * DirectX: DirectX 12 (Feature Level 12.0)\n  * Storage: 30GB\n  * Sound Card: Windows-compatible audio device\n\n\n### **Recommended Specifications**\n  * Operating System: Windows 11\n  * Processor: Intel Core i5-11500 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600\n  * Memory: 16GB RAM\n  * Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 8GB or AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8GB\n  * DirectX: DirectX 12 (Feature Level 12.0)\n  * Storage: 30GB\n  * Sound Card: Windows-compatible audio device\n\n\nUnlike Elden Ring, Nightreign isn't just a soulslike/RPG, it is a soulslike with roguelike elements, as in it features permadeath. It offers a purely Player versus environment (PvE) gameplay, meaning it supports a singleplayer experience, though it is primarily designed as a 3-player co-op multiplayer roguelike. Players can choose a character from one of 8 playable classes: Wylder, Duchess, Recluse, Guardian. There are 4 more characters that are yet to be revealed by FromSoftware. The characters are premade, so there is no character creator, but players will be able to customize the appearance of their characters. Nightreign's map layout is static, but the encounters are randomized to offer a unique experience every run. Each run consists of a survival mode for a couple of days, and then taking on a boss in a fight to the death.\nElden Ring: Nightreign is set to launch on May 29 for PC, [PlayStation 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/14/sony-increases-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S.\nSource: [PCGamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/)\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Firefox 138 is the latest version of Mozilla's open source browser. It will be released later today, if you are reading this on April 29th, 2025.\nIt is the third major Firefox release in a row that introduced highly requested features in the browser. [Firefox 136](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/04/firefox-136-launches-with-vertical-tabs-but-one-requested-feature-is-still-missing/) introduced vertical tabs, [Firefox 137](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/01/firefox-137-rolls-out-with-tab-groups-address-bar-refresh-and-more/) tab groups, and Firefox 138, today's release, improved profile management.\nAs always, Firefox 128.10 ESR and Firefox 115.23 ESR are also released today. These are extended security update releases for Firefox that fix security issues and issues only.\n## Firefox 138: the major changes\n## Improved Profile Management\n[I reviewed an early version of Firefox's profile management](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/20/a-look-at-firefoxs-improved-profiles-manager-that-just-launched/) in January. Firefox [has supported profiles](https://www.ghacks.net/2008/04/30/working-with-several-firefox-profiles/) for a long time, but it was not obvious how to use it. Veteran users know the startup parameter -p or that they can manage profiles by loading about:profiles.\nThe new profiles manager brings Firefox's profile management closer to its Chromium counterparts.\nOnce enabled, it is available via Menu > Profiles. You can create profiles, switch to a profile, or manage them from the starting point.\nEach profile works as a separate data set in Firefox. Any customizations you make, e.g., installing extensions, changing settings, or adding bookmarks, applies only to that profile.\nProfiles are ideal for separating different types of activities. Say, a profile for studying, one of entertainment, and one for shopping.\n**Note** : The feature is rolling out over time. You can enable it right away in the following way:\n  1. Load about:config in the Firefox address bar.\n  2. Accept the disclaimer to continue.\n  3. Search for browser.profiles.enabled.\n  4. Click on the toggle to set the value of the preference to true.\n  5. Restart Firefox.\n\n\n### Other changes and fixes\n  * Users in the United States may now see weather information in the address bar when they search for weather information. Typing weather, for instance, should display the current weather in the user's location. Note that this has a sponsored tag next to it and that this is also rolling out over time.\n  * Firefox popup windows on Windows 11 use acrylic-style menus now to better match the operating system's aesthetics.\n  * Links from background tabs may now be copied on Mac and Linux using the context menu.\n\n\n**Developer changes**\n  * The importmap value of the type attribute of the <script> element now supports the integrity key.\n  * The Error.captureStackTrace() static method is now supported.\n  * The Error.isError() static method can now be used to check whether or not an object is an instance of an Error or a DOMException.\n  * The import declaration now supports importing JSON modules using the with attribute.\n  * The Clear-Site-Data header can be used with the cache (and *) directive to clear the browser network cache.\n  * The HTTP Origin-Agent-Cluster response header can now be used by a site to hint that the associated document should be placed in an origin-keyed agent cluster.\n  * The Login Status API is now supported when using the Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API.\n  * The Web Audio API now supports bidirectional messaging on an AudioWorklet.port and an AudioWorkletGlobalScope.port.\n  * WebRTC applications can now set a preference for prioritizing framerate or resolution when both cannot be maintained at the configured levels due to network degradation.\n  * The new Manifest V3 version of the userScripts API is now available on Firefox for Android.\n  * Support added to enable the manipulation of tabs within tab groups.\n\n\n**Enterprise changes**\n  * Fixed an add-on installation issue that bypassed an add-ons new permissions prompt during updates for policy-installed add-ons.\n  * Firefox supports the Content Analysis SDK now for integrating DLP software.\n  * Disabling Telemetry also disables Firefox Labs.\n  * DisabledCiphers policy was updated with additional ciphers.\n  * SkipTermsOfUse policy is now available to \"not show the new terms of use2.\n  * ContentAnalysis policy has been added.\n\n\n**Security updates / fixes**\nMozilla patched eleven security vulnerabilities or issues that could potentially be exploited in the new Firefox release. The aggregate severity rating is high, and Mozilla does not mention any exploits in the wild.\nIt is still recommended to update immediately.\n## Firefox 138.0 download and update\nMost Firefox installations will be updated automatically in the coming days. Firefox users may speed up the process by selecting Menu > Help > About Firefox.\nPlease note that this works only after the official release by Mozilla.\nDownloads are also provided on [Mozilla's official website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/desktop-release/).\n  * [Firefox Beta download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/)\n  * [Nightly download](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)\n  * [Firefox ESR download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/)\n\n\n**Outlook**\nFirefox 139, Firefox 115.24 and Firefox 128.11 will be released on May 27th to the public. The June release will introduced Firefox 140 as the new ESR.\n**Additional information / resources**\n  * [Firefox 138 release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/138.0/releasenotes/)\n  * [Firefox 128.10.0 ESR release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/128.10.0/releasenotes/)\n  * [Firefox 115.23.0 ESR release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/115.23.0/releasenotes/)\n  * [Firefox 138 for Developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/138)\n  * [Firefox 138 for Enterprise](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-enterprise-138-release-notes)\n  * [Firefox Security Advisories](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/)\n  * [Firefox Release Schedule](https://www.ghacks.net/2012/08/16/mozilla-firefox-release-schedule/)\n\n\n**Closing Words**\nMozilla has released three big features in the last three releases.

    "content": "[Work on Android 16](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/01/24/android-16-beta-1-is-out-here-is-what-is-new-or-changing/), the big Android release of 2025 continues. Deep dives into beta versions of Android 16 revealed a few security features already, including [Identity Check](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/16/identity-check-could-come-to-phones-with-android-16/) and improved theft protections.\nA new security feature called Advanced Protection will also make its debut in Android 16. The feature, which brings Google's Advanced Protection Program to Android devices, locks various features on Android 16 devices in order to improve security.\nUp until now, this included disabling 2G access, no sideloading permission for apps, the blocking of WEP connections, and MTE available only for compatible apps.\n## USB-based attack protection\nAnother feature of Advanced Protection is that many USB-based attacks are prevented while the mode is active. [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-usb-data-advanced-protection-3548018/) discovered strings in the latest Android 16 build that reveals information about USB protection.\nAccording to the information, USB connections are blocked when the Android device is locked and Advanced Protection is enabled. A test confirmed the functionality, and that already connected USB devices are not disconnected when the screen is locked.\n**Why this is important:** USB devices, like USB keyboards or sticks, may be used in attacks. Many computer users know that they should not insert USB devices from unknown sources into their computers.\nOn Android, similar attacks may happen when a USB device is connected to an Android device. While many Android users may also be careful when it comes to connecting unknown devices, that is not helping when a phone or tablet gets lost or stolen.\nThis is the main situation where Advanced Protection kicks in, provided that the Android device is locked and the PIN was not brute forced or guessed.\nWhile data connections are blocked, Android devices continue to be charged via USB, even with the feature enabled and the device locked.\nAdvanced Protection blocks USB device connections when the phone or tablet is locked. Android users who want to connect a USB device but forgot about the security feature need to disconnect it, unlock the device, and then reconnect the USB device to establish a working connection.\nAndroid Authority uploaded a demo video to YouTube that showcases the new feature on Android 16.\nThe new Advanced Protection feature will be opt-in. Means, Android users need to enable it before it starts protecting the device actively. It is unclear yet if Android users can enable or disable specific features of Advanced Protection, or if this is an all or nothing security feature.\nIt remains to be seen how this will work, especially regarding the sideloading protection. Will it affect already installed apps or updates of such apps, or only new installs?\n_Now You: What is your take on this new security feature? Would you enable Advanced Protection on your devices? Let us know in the comment section below._\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

As the company phases out Assistant, it has been indicated that many mobile devices will soon rely on Gemini instead, phasing out the traditional Google Assistant in the process.\nPreviously, the Assistant Driving Mode was designed to provide users with a simplified interface for navigation, featuring a media playback bar and control buttons. It had been particularly useful for Android users without vehicles equipped with Android Auto, serving as a mobile alternative. However, more than a year has passed since the last major update, during which even basic features like playback controls and voice commands associated with Driving Mode have been eliminated from Google Maps.\nInterestingly, Assistant Driving Mode was originally envisioned as a competitor to [Android Auto](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/08/29/android-auto-disappeared-after-the-latest-update/) for phone screens, a feature that was discontinued in 2021. The app launcher, which offered easy-to-touch icons for messaging and media control, was removed earlier this year, adding to the feature's gradual decline.\nGoogle is making a long-term commitment to Gemini, and continues to [integrate](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/02/gemini-for-kids-googles-upcoming-ai-chatbot-tailored-for-young-users/) its AI services everywhere it can.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

Following the update that was released on Friday, many users have reported losing access to critical settings, most notably the inability to access upscaling features such as [DLSS](https://www.ghacks.net/2023/08/23/nvidia-dlss-3-5-release-date-and-more/) (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and Frame Generation.\nThis limitation forces the game to run at native resolution, which increases the performance costs, and making it difficult for players to maintain a smooth frame rate while exploring the expansive world of Cyrodiil. Some users have argued that the game is unoptimized and that these issues affect many games that run on [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/12/warhorse-studios-co-founder-criticizes-unreal-engine-5-for-open-world-game-development/).\n[Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/oblivion-remastered-pc-game-pass-botched-patch) reports that the state of the game mirrors previous problems encountered in the PC Game Pass version of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, which launched without DLSS support. Despite various patches being issued post-launch, many players find the loss of upscaling options frustrating, particularly for those operating on older hardware that benefits from these enhancements. As modern titles increasingly require advanced graphical features like ray tracing and upscaling technologies, the lack of support can severely hinder the gaming experience.\nAdditionally, players have expressed frustration over the absence of cross-save functionality between [Xbox](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/14/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-to-enhance-xbox-experience/) and Steam. Oblivion Remastered's current limitations not only frustrate individual players but also raise questions regarding the overall cohesion of the gaming ecosystem.\nA patch to reinstate DLSS support and the implementation of cross-save functionality between Xbox and Steam are highly anticipated by the community, promising a more seamless experience for avid fans of the beloved RPG.\nInterestingly, the [Steam](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/02/06/steam-now-warns-buyers-about-abandoned-early-access-games/) version of Oblivion Remastered was not affected by the update. However, the game seems to be plagued with issues, [Digital Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0rCA1vpgSw)'s review criticized the performance problems of Oblivion Remastered on PC.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The controversial feature is currently being rolled out as part of a non-security preview update, [KB5055627](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-25-2025-kb5055627-os-build-26100-3915-preview-9324a361-965a-4496-8fd8-ba8a9de9fc38).\nRecall acts as an assistant for users who wish to find specific information of their past activities, by searching for things using natural language. The tool captures snapshots of the screen frequently, and the AI analyzes the content and stores the data in a searchable database. Microsoft [backed out](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/06/14/the-end-of-windows-11s-recall-ai-feature-microsoft-postpones-launch/) of its plans to release the automatic-snapshot capturing tool for Windows 11 [Copilot+ PC](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/01/microsoft-expands-snapdragon-exclusive-copilot-features-to-intel-and-amd-pcs/)s in June last year, when it was called out by experts for the privacy and security risks it posed to users.\nIn [September 2024](https://www.ghacks.net/2024/09/30/windows-recall-microsofts-second-launch-attempt-after-devastating-criticism/), Microsoft revealed that it had improved Recall and that it would be opt-in, and offered better privacy, because it now requires users to authenticate via Windows Hello. Earlier this month, information about the AI-powered tool resurfaced when Microsoft published the change-log for a [Release Preview Build 26100.3902](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/11/windows-11-controversial-recall-ai-feature-is-making-a-comeback-in-latest-build/). It is still in preview for Copilot+ PCs, and was expected to remain so for a while.\nBut things seem to be progressing faster than anticipated. Windows Recall is now being tested in the stable channel of Windows 11, through an optional preview update that users may choose to install. This update also ships with Improved Windows Search, which is another feature for Copilot+ PC that uses semantic indexing models and traditional lexical indexing, to find your files faster using natural language. Another AI-feature that this update integrates is Image Search, which is designed to help users find photos stored and saved in the cloud, directly from the Start Menu. Both of these features are available for AMD and Intel-powered Copilot+ PCs, along with some improvements to Narrator and Phone Link.\nMicrosoft VP for Security David Weston confirmed to [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-finally-launches-its-controversial-recall-feature) that Recall is opt-in, and users can uninstall it if they don't want to use it. The tool will use end-to-end encryption to prevent others from accessing your files, and this includes Microsoft itself. He also stated that Recall stores the data locally on the user's PC, calling it the \"most secure experience on Windows\" as it is protected by Windows Hello's biometric authentication.\nThe next Patch Tuesday update for [Windows 11](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/04/24/windows-11-green-screen-of-death-is-rolling-out-what-you-need-to-know/) could bring Recall to your Copilot+ PC.\nThank you for being a Ghacks reader.

EY’s offering focuses on helping enterprises manage core SAP workloads post-migration, including finance, HR, and payroll.\nThe firm has also joined the SAP PartnerEdge program as a managed services provider, positioning itself to provide long-term operational support and process optimization. DXC, meanwhile, introduced a bundled service that combines its SAP and Microsoft expertise to accelerate ERP migration timelines, with roadmaps that can be executed in as little as 12 months.\nThe new services arrive as SAP continues to lean on its partner ecosystem to deliver on its cloud-first strategy. Migration from ECC to S/4HANA involves navigating data reformatting, technical debt, and evolving cloud operations—areas where customers often need external support. EY and DXC join a growing field of system integrators and managed service providers that are helping SAP customers meet compliance needs, improve agility, and align IT architecture with business growth goals.\nFor SAP, partner-led migrations are particularly important in the mid-market segment, where it sees major expansion opportunities. Vendors like DXC are integrating SAP’s RISE program with cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, while EY is focused on driving post-migration value through intelligent automation and process efficiency. As the cloud ERP market heats up, these partnerships will play a critical role in shaping customer adoption paths and long-term platform success.\n[ChannelE2E Staff](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/channele2e-staff)\n### Related\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/news/salesforce-launches-life-sciences-partner-network-to-streamline-digital-labor-and-data-integration)\n[Cloud migration](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/cloud-migration)\n##### [Salesforce Launches Life Sciences Partner Network to Streamline Digital Labor and Data Integration](https://www.channele2e.com/news/salesforce-launches-life-sciences-partner-network-to-streamline-digital-labor-and-data-integration)\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)May 8, 2025\nSalesforce Unveils Life Sciences Partner Network to Accelerate Digital Labor and Data Programs\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/news/ibm-expands-agentic-ai-footprint-through-strategic-collaborations-with-oracle-aws-and-salesforce)\n[AI/ML](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/aiml)\n##### [IBM Expands Agentic AI Footprint Through Strategic Collaborations with Oracle, AWS, Salesforce, and Lumen](https://www.channele2e.com/news/ibm-expands-agentic-ai-footprint-through-strategic-collaborations-with-oracle-aws-and-salesforce)\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)May 6, 2025\nIBM Unveils Strategic Alliances to Propel Agentic AI and Hybrid Cloud Innovations\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/news/ibm-extends-byoc-deployment-model-for-netezza-and-db2-saas-across-aws-and-azure)\n[Multi-cloud management](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/multi-cloud-management)\n##### [IBM Extends BYOC Deployment Model for Netezza and Db2 SaaS Across AWS and Azure](https://www.channele2e.com/news/ibm-extends-byoc-deployment-model-for-netezza-and-db2-saas-across-aws-and-azure)\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)May 5, 2025\nIBM Extends BYOC Deployment Model for Netezza and Db2 SaaS Across AWS and Azure\nRelated Terms\n[ARPANET](https://www.channele2e.com/glossary/A#arpanet)[Autonomous System](https://www.channele2e.com/glossary/A#autonomous_system)[Cloud Computing](https://www.channele2e.com/glossary/C#cloud_computing)[Greynet](https://www.channele2e.com/glossary/G#greynet)\nYou can skip this ad in 5 seconds",

    "title": "Syncro’s New XMM Platform Aims to Help MSPs Reduce RMM and PSA Tool Sprawl",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "May 8, 2025\n[By Todd R. Weiss](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/todd-r-weiss)\nTangle and untangle concept. Psychotherapy, psychology doodle illustration. Coach abstract icon. Coaching sign. Tangled and untangled symbol.\nMSP platform vendor Syncro has unveiled its new Extended Monitoring and Management (XMM) platform that now integrates three important MSP services into one, making it easier for MSPs to better serve their business customers. The new XMM offering was created in collaboration with Microsoft and includes integration with several Microsoft applications and services.\nThe [unified Syncro XMM platform](https://syncromsp.com/media-release/syncro-launches-xmm-unified-it-and-security-management-platform-with-microsoft-integration/) brings together Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), Professional Services Automation (PSA), and Microsoft 365 multi-tenant management into a single service offering for MSPs, relieving them of the burden of configuring and managing three separate products for customers, , the chief product officer of Syncro, told ChannelE2E. The built-in Microsoft integrations include Microsoft Secure Score, Defender Antivirus and Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), which give MSPs the tools that will allow them to securely manage their clients' cloud infrastructures.\n“Syncro's deep collaboration with Microsoft is core to XMM’s innovation,” said Zepf. “Most solutions today force MSPs to juggle a stack of loosely integrated tools: a PSA, an RMM, and often multiple separate tools to manage Microsoft 365. XMM changes that. It is a unified solution that is built from the ground up to work together. XMM simplifies deployment, reduces operational complexity, and strengthens security, helping MSPs deliver more value with less effort.”\nThe services integrations were suggestions from MSPs, said Zepf. “The idea came directly from the challenges MSPs told us they were facing – tool sprawl, increasing security risks, and the need to operate more efficiently,” she said.\n“Not only did our MSP partners specifically ask us to help them manage Microsoft 365, but they also told us they were frustrated by how many tools they had to manage and by how much work it was to integrate and get those tools to work together. They wanted deeper integration, less manual effort, and better visibility across their environments. We worked closely with our customers, partners, and Microsoft to envision what the ideal platform would look like, and that collaboration led to XMM.”\n## Removing Integration Risks with XMM: Analyst\n, principal analyst of Enderle Group, told ChannelE2E that Syncro’s new combined XMM platform will be helpful for MSPs and their business customers.\n“Bringing products together like this means Syncro is assuring the integration between them, removing the integration risk for everyone else,” said Enderle. “Microsoft typically does a poor job of this, so an integration effort is very much appreciated by end customers.”\nThe combination of these pre-packaged and pre-combined components will be a boon for already busy MSPs, he added.\n“It removes a lot of the friction on both making the sale and integrating the result, giving buyers critical piece of mind that what they bought will actually perform as promised,” said Enderle. “It is one of the better ways to show value as it addresses a problem that would otherwise have to be considered an open-ended risk of the separate offerings not playing well together. [The separate products would have also] required a lot of expensive custom and unbudgeted work to reach an acceptable level of performance and interoperation.”\nThe new Syncro XMM services continue a trend of a security services expansion by many vendors to assist their customers, said Enderle. “Security remains a top topic with exposures and exploits reaching [corporate] board levels [within companies], which continue to fund increased security expending. But interoperation problems often plague the result so a security solution that assures interoperability should be very well received, driving interest in MSPs to up their security offerings.”\n## Key Features of the Syncro XMM Platform\nIn addition to integrating RMM, PSA and several Microsoft services for MSPs, the Syncro XMM platform simplifies operations by consolidating IT management, security, and automation, while also improving security by automating Microsoft 365 compliance monitoring, security hygiene, and risk assessments. In addition, the XMM platform helps MSPs to scale their businesses through integrated service automation, ticketing, and Microsoft 365 multi-tenant management, according to Syncro.\nIn April, [Syncro added built-in network discovery capabilities](https://www.channele2e.com/news/syncro-bolsters-its-rmm-and-automation-platform-with-built-in-network-discovery) to its unified Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) and Professional Services Automation (PSA) platform that allows MSPs to easily manage their customers’ connected devices.\n### An In-Depth Guide to Cloud Security\nGet essential knowledge and practical strategies to fortify your cloud security.\n[Learn More](https://www.scworld.com/hub-cloud-security)\n[Todd R.

The new Life Sciences Partner Network is designed to accelerate adoption of [Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/)—Salesforce’s AI-powered digital labor platform—by enabling seamless data integration, industry-specific skills, and implementation support.\nThe partner ecosystem includes system integrators, ISVs, and consulting firms offering services from migration to agent-first deployments. This includes access to AgentExchange capabilities, out-of-the-box data kits, and integration connectors built for the life sciences industry. Combined, these services help healthcare organizations activate and harmonize structured and unstructured data across clinical, commercial, and manufacturing systems to improve productivity, compliance, and patient outcomes.\nSalesforce’s collaboration with partners like athenahealth, H1, Definitive Healthcare, Viz.ai, and Infinitus.ai brings critical real-time data into the Life Sciences Cloud. These integrations support AI-driven workflows such as patient engagement, adverse event triage, content approvals, and prior authorizations. Agentforce leverages this data to automate tasks, provide insights, and augment human teams across research, marketing, and quality operations.\nSalesforce is also leaning on a broad bench of partners—Accenture, PwC, Deloitte, Cognizant, BCG, McKinsey, and more—to help orgs navigate the complexity of change. Add in LPW for training and support, and you’ve got a framework to not just implement AI, but to make it stick across the business. This move shows Salesforce is serious about putting real infrastructure behind its Agentforce strategy, giving life sciences teams a clearer path to scalable, compliant digital transformation.\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)\nSuparna serves as Senior Managing Editor for CyberRisk Alliance’s Channel Brands, including MSSP Alert and ChannelE2E.

    "content": "May 8, 2025\n[By ChannelE2E Staff](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/channele2e-staff)\n(Adobe Stock)\nBroadcom is making its expectations clear for VMware partners: align with its private cloud strategy centered on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) or risk being sidelined, according to [Channel Futures](https://www.channelfutures.com/cloud/broadcom-to-vmware-partners-evolve-or-be-left-behind). In a pair of blogs published May 5, Broadcom’s top partner and product leaders laid out the company’s evolving stance, signaling a shift toward rewarding those partners deeply invested in delivering full-stack services and driving long-term VCF adoption. This includes everything from presales to post-deployment optimization.\nThe company’s reassessment of partner incentives and program structure comes amid growing traction for VCF as Broadcom’s preferred private cloud platform. As adoption accelerates, the focus is shifting away from transactional engagements and toward partners who can drive measurable customer outcomes. That means offering not just technical expertise, but end-to-end capabilities like advisory services, phased deployments, and continuous support.\nBroadcom is already citing examples of successful partner-led VCF rollouts—ranging from healthcare and legal sectors in the U.S. to major financial institutions in Asia—to demonstrate the impact of this approach. The message is consistent: value-based solution providers that show real commitment to the platform will receive greater resources, program benefits, and strategic investment.\nWith urgency in tone, Broadcom is signaling that the window for alignment is short. Both executives pointed to the need for partners to quickly adapt, build out dedicated VCF practices, and scale across industries and customer sizes. As Broadcom redefines what it expects from its ecosystem, VMware partners will need to decide whether they’re ready to lead in this platform-driven model—or risk falling behind.\n[ChannelE2E Staff](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/channele2e-staff)\n### Related\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/news/argano-acquires-real-dynamics-to-strengthen-microsoft-dynamics-services)\n[Mergers and Acquisitions](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/mergers-and-acquisitions)\n##### [Argano Acquires Real Dynamics to Strengthen Microsoft Dynamics Services](https://www.channele2e.com/news/argano-acquires-real-dynamics-to-strengthen-microsoft-dynamics-services)\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)May 7, 2025\nArgano Acquires Real Dynamics to Expand Microsoft Dynamics Capabilities and Global Delivery\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/brief/generative-ai-tops-2025-tech-budgets-outpacing-cybersecurity)\n[Channel markets](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/channel-markets)\n##### [Generative AI Tops 2025 Tech Budgets, Outpacing Cybersecurity](https://www.channele2e.com/brief/generative-ai-tops-2025-tech-budgets-outpacing-cybersecurity)\n[ChannelE2E Staff](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/channele2e-staff)May 7, 2025\nGenerative AI Tops 2025 Tech Budgets, Outpacing Cybersecurity\n[](https://www.channele2e.com/news/saviynt-taps-chillisoft-to-expand-identity-security-reach-in-new-zealand)\n[Cloud Security](https://www.channele2e.com/topic/cloud-security)\n##### [Saviynt Taps Chillisoft to Expand Identity Security Reach in New Zealand](https://www.channele2e.com/news/saviynt-taps-chillisoft-to-expand-identity-security-reach-in-new-zealand)\n[Suparna Chawla Bhasin](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/suparna-chawla-bhasin)May 5, 2025\nSaviynt Appoints Chillisoft as Strategic Distribution Partner to Expand Identity Security Footprint in New Zealand\n### Related Events\n  * Webcast##### [Creating Value in an Uncertain Market](https://www.channele2e.com/webcast/creating-value-in-an-uncertain-market)\nWed Jun 18\n\n\nYou can skip this ad in 5 seconds",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "May 7, 2025\n[By Judit Sharon](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/judit-sharon)\n(Adobe Stock)\nCOMMENTARY: In 2024, the cyber threat landscape reached a new level of urgency. According to [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/government-and-development-industries-report-threefold-decrease-in-critical-cyber-incidents-in-2024), high-severity incidents in the IT sector surged, accounting for 23% of the most critical cases across industries. For managed service providers (MSPs), this escalation isn’t just a warning. It’s a wake-up call demanding immediate action.\nAs attacks become more frequent and complex, cybersecurity teams face relentless pressure to react fast 24/7. Yet many still rely on email notifications, which can easily get lost in the clutter, leading to slow response times and costly downtime. That is why automated incident notification is now critical, not just to stay competitive but to stay protected.\n## The Need for Speed\nCybersecurity events such as ransomware attacks, data breaches, and network intrusions demand immediate action where every second counts. Delays in notification give threats time to escalate, which can lead to data loss, reputational damage, and operational chaos.\nAutomated notification tools solve this by instantly alerting (pager-like) the right personnel, eliminating delays tied to manual escalation or missed emails. A study by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) found that organizations using automated response processes cut breach costs by up to 95% compared to those using manual methods. For MSPs, these systems can mean the difference between stopping a breach early or discovering it after major damage is done.\n## Reducing Downtime and Financial Exposure\nTime-to-response directly impacts financial outcomes. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/987474/global-average-cost-data-breach/) reported that the average cost of a data breach globally in 2024 was $4.88 million, a 10% increase over the previous year. In the U.S., this figure was notably higher, averaging $9.36 million per incident. Automated alerting tools help reduce this by speeding up containment and resolution. Instead of relying on slow, manual communication chains, automated systems activate the right experts immediately—regardless of location or time of day. This rapid mobilization is especially crucial for MSPs managing multiple client environments. Downtime in even one system can trigger SLA penalties and erode client trust.\n## Coordinating Global, Distributed Teams\nMSPs often oversee cybersecurity operations across regions, requiring seamless coordination among on-call professionals. Automated notification tools support this by enabling smooth shift transitions and time zone coverage through intelligent routing and escalation workflows.\nThese platforms follow on-call schedules to ensure alerts reach the right person at the right time. Features like acknowledgment tracking and cascading alerts guarantee that if the first responder is unavailable, the alert automatically escalates—no manual follow-up needed.\nThe result is uninterrupted, reliable communication that reinforces your coverage around the clock.\n## Combating Alert Fatigue with Smarter Notifications\nAlert fatigue is a stubbornly persistent problem. A flood of low-priority notifications can overwhelm even skilled analysts, slowing down responses to critical threats. [Trend Micro](https://newsroom.trendmicro.com/2021-05-25-70-Of-SOC-Teams-Emotionally-Overwhelmed-By-Security-Alert-Volume) research shows that 70% of IT professionals experience alert fatigue—a risk that grows for MSPs juggling multiple client environments.\nModern notification platforms combat this problem by prioritizing alerts based on severity. These systems take a triage approach to suppress non-urgent messages during high-volume periods and push high-severity alerts through persistent channels like app notifications.\n## Building a Compliant Response Process\nFor MSPs or IT organizations in regulated industries—or supporting clients who are—compliance with standards like HIPAA, GDPR, and NIST is critical. Automated platforms offer detailed audit trails, logging every alert, acknowledgment, and response. These logs are essential during audits and demonstrate that the organization has a structured, compliant incident response process in place. According to Gartner, organizations with integrated automated response strategies face 30% fewer compliance penalties. MSPs can use these features to provide greater value to clients in healthcare, finance, and government.\n## Seamless Integration with Security Infrastructure\nA major benefit of today’s notification tools is their ability to seamlessly integrate with existing security infrastructure. From SIEMs to IDS and EDR platforms, these tools pull in threat data and instantly convert it into actionable alerts. A [Cybersecurity Insiders](https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/2024-insider-threat-report/) survey found that 83% of organizations prioritize integration when selecting alerting tools. For MSPs, this means less manual input and faster response times, turning threat intelligence into action—not just another data point.\n## A Cybersecurity Imperative, Not a Luxury\nAs cyber threats evolve, so must the tools used to fight them. Automated incident notification is no longer a luxury—it’s a core component of modern cybersecurity strategy. For MSPs delivering backup, disaster recovery, and managed security services, these tools offer measurable advantages in speed, responsiveness, and client satisfaction. Whether it’s speeding up containment, reducing fatigue, maintaining compliance, or ensuring a 24/7 response, automated notifications are transforming how security teams operate.\nWith 2024 marking a spike in serious cyber incidents, the demand for real-time, intelligent alerting solutions has never been greater -- 2025 may be even worse. For MSPs looking to stay ahead of evolving threats, automated incident response isn’t just proactive—it’s essential.\n**_ChannelE2E Perspectives columns are written by trusted members of the managed services, value-added reseller, and solution provider channels_** **_or ChannelE2E staff._** **_Do you have a unique perspective you want to share?_**[**_Check out our guidelines here_**](https://www.channele2e.com/perspective/channele2e-perspectives-columnists)** _and send a pitch to_**[** _[email protected]_**](https://www.channele2e.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#57343f363939323b3265327927322524273234233e21322417342e353225253e243c363b3b3e363934327934383a)**_._**\n[ Judit Sharon](https://www.channele2e.com/contributor/judit-sharon)\nJudit Sharon is the CEO and founder of OnPage Corporation, a provider of an advanced, secure critical communication and collaboration platform designed to ensure that urgent alerts are never missed.

With this integration, Sectigo’s cloud-native platform—Certificate Manager for Partners—becomes the first CLM offering available on Pax8. The move targets a growing pain point for MSPs tasked with securing digital infrastructure while managing the increasing volume and complexity of SSL/TLS certificates.\nManual certificate management has become increasingly risky as businesses scale and certificate validity periods continue to shorten. A single expired certificate can disrupt operations, lead to compliance issues, or cause customer-facing outages. By offering automation through the ACME protocol, Sectigo eliminates these risks and reduces the workload on IT teams. MSPs can now oversee certificate issuance, renewal, and replacement from a unified dashboard—streamlining an essential, but often overlooked, security function.\nThe partnership also opens new business opportunities. MSPs can offer CLM as a recurring service to clients, boosting retention while reducing internal resource strain. By removing the manual overhead and associated risk, providers can deliver more value to a broader customer base without additional staffing or tools.\nFor Pax8, the addition strengthens its overall security portfolio, aligning with the platform’s focus on delivering scalable, efficient cloud services.

Now an expert has reportedly suggested that the scale of work is so massive, it could even alter local weather patterns.\nAccording to a report by the _Financial Times_ , Donald Wuebbles, an expert in atmospheric physics and chemistry who serves as a paid adviser to Neom, has told the British newspaper that he has repeatedly raised concerns that the size of Neom's many ongoing projects could disrupt local weather systems in harmful ways.\nWe already know that cities can create an [urban heat island](https://newatlas.com/urban-heat-island-effect-doubles-climate-costs-cities/49765/) effect and that large buildings can have all sorts of unintended consequences, including the [melting of cars](https://newatlas.com/walkie-talkie-skyscraper-melts-jaguar/28917/). The issue here is similar but on an even larger and more dramatic scale. Indeed, Wuebbles says that the damaging effects may include unpredictable changes to rain patterns and sandstorms, and the amplification of winds.\nThe largest part of Neom is, of course, the Line, which will have a height of 500 m (1,640 ft), an eventual planned length of 170 km (105 miles) and a mirrored exterior that could pose issues for the local wildlife, especially the bird population. However, Neom also encompasses [Oxagon](https://newatlas.com/technology/port-of-neom-in-saudi-arabia-expanding-to-be-largest-in-the-world/), [Epicon](https://newatlas.com/architecture/epicon-neom-saudi-arabia/), [Treyam](https://newatlas.com/architecture/treyam-saudi-bridge-resort-neom/), and more.\nAnother worry raised by Wuebbles is the environmental toll of the construction process itself and the resulting emissions produced. For example, [20% of the world's steel](https://newatlas.com/architecture/line-saudi-arabia-neom-construction-update/) is being used to build just the Line, while a huge concrete plant is also under construction to help realize Saudi Arabia's ambition to become a tourism hotspot.\nStill, any potential effects on the climate are unlikely to slow down the momentum of this giga-project. Despite worries about [paying for it all](https://newatlas.com/architecture/neom-march-update-saudi-arabia/), the [first phase](https://newatlas.com/architecture/line-construction-update-first-phase-feb/) of the Line itself has already begun to rise, while elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, the [Mukaab](https://newatlas.com/architecture/mukaab-saudi-construction/) and the [JEC Tower](https://newatlas.com/architecture/jec-tower-worlds-tallest-skyscraper-saudi-arabia/) are well underway too.\nSource: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/8bb45e6e-5a1b-4e93-ad40-8f0568e02274) [paywall]\n[ View gallery - 4 images ](https://newatlas.com/architecture/neom-weather-change-report/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Architecture](https://newatlas.com/architecture/)[Building and Construction](https://newatlas.com/tag/building+and+construction/)[Saudi Arabia](https://newatlas.com/tag/saudi-arabia/)[Neom](https://newatlas.com/tag/neom/)[Weather](https://newatlas.com/tag/weather/)[Climate Crisis](https://newatlas.com/tag/climate-change/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Saudi%20Arabia%27s%20Neom%3A%20A%20project%20so%20huge%20it%20could%20change%20the%20weather&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Farchitecture%2Fneom-weather-change-report%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/architecture/neom-weather-change-report/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\n[Adam Williams](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

The vagus nerve is the main nerve of your parasympathetic nervous system, which controls key involuntary body functions like your heart rate, digestion, immune system, and even your mood.\nThis is also the the largest parasympathetic nerve in the body, and it runs from the brain to the large intestine. There are left and right vagal nerves that join to form the vagal trunk. Stimulating these nerves with electrical impulses can help treat epilepsy and depression, and could also help address conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and PTSD.\nThis new treatment works in tandem with a traditional PTSD treatment called prolonged exposure therapy (PET), where patients gradually confront the memories and situations they've been struggling with, in a controlled and safe environment.\nThe research team, which includes scientists at The University of Texas at Dallas and Baylor University Medical Center, combined PET with the delivery of short bursts of stimulation of the vagus nerve through a small device fitted to a participant’s neck.\nThe researchers conducted a Phase 1 trial with nine patients over 12 vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) sessions. In assessing the participants four times over the course of six months after the therapy had concluded, they found that all the patients were symptom-free.\n\"In a trial like this, some subjects usually do get better, but rarely do they lose their PTSD diagnosis,\" said Dr. Michael Kilgard, a neuroscience professor at UT Dallas and an author of [the paper that appeared in the journal _Brain Stimulation_](https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X\\(25\\)00060-9/fulltext) in March. \"Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives. In this case, we had 100% loss of diagnosis. It’s very promising.”\nVNS is thought to enhance synaptic plasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt at the level of its neural connections. PET shows the brain what connections need to change (those involved in the fear response to trauma memories). Meanwhile, VNS provides a chemical 'boost' (through neuromodulators, or chemical messengers that can influence neural activity, like acetylcholine and norepinephrine) that makes the brain's wiring more capable of changing during that specific time.\nThis enhancement of plasticity is thought to make the extinction of fear stronger and more lasting, leading to the observed reductions in PTSD symptoms.\nThe concept of using VNS isn't entirely new: more that a decade ago, it had been shown to effectively aid in treating movement impairment in people who've suffered a stroke, and more recently in [reducing fatigue in sleep-deprived subjects](https://newatlas.com/science/electric-stimulation-vagus-nerve-sleep-deprivation-focus-alertness/).\nBeyond finding a way to apply it in conjunction with PET, the researchers also developed a tiny dime-sized implantable VNS device to deliver bursts of stimulation, which could make it far easier to deliver treatment.\nThis new method joins the list of numerous innovative approaches to treating PTSD from recent years, including [the use of psychedelic drugs](https://newatlas.com/medical/australia-first-mdma-psilocybin-treatment/), [short bursts of exercise](https://newatlas.com/medical/10-minute-bursts-exercise-therapy-ptsd/), [mindfulness programs](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/mindfulness-program-post-traumatic-stress/), and [even the video game _Tetris_](https://newatlas.com/mental-health/tetris-therapy-ptsd-flashbacks/).\nThe Texas team's already on its next move: a more comprehensive Phase 2 pilot study with participants in Dallas and Austin. The researchers hope this could one day serve as an option \"for people who don’t get better with cognitive behavioral therapy alone.”\nSource: [UT Dallas](https://news.utdallas.edu/health-medicine/study-ptsd-vagus-nerve-stimulation-2025/)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/mental-health/ptsd-treatment-vagus-nerve-neck/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Mental Health](https://newatlas.com/mental-health/)[PTSD](https://newatlas.com/tag/ptsd/)[Nerves](https://newatlas.com/tag/nerves/)[University of Texas](https://newatlas.com/tag/university-of-texas/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=PTSD%20treatment%20that%20excites%20a%20nerve%20in%20your%20neck%20wipes%20symptoms%20completely&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fmental-health%2Fptsd-treatment-vagus-nerve-neck%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/mental-health/ptsd-treatment-vagus-nerve-neck/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

Case in point is the Shenzhen Science & Technology Museum which is defined by an extraordinary futuristic form intended to help reduce its energy usage.\nThe project was initially revealed [back in 2020](https://newatlas.com/architecture/zaha-hadid-shenzhen-science-technology-museum/) and, as its name suggests, is located in the Chinese megacity Shenzhen, specifically in its Guangming District.\nThe design team used complex computer modeling systems and wind tunnel testing, to help ensure the building maintains a relatively stable temperature even during summer months. The result looks a little like a cruise ship – or perhaps even a spaceship – and is likened by the firm to celestial bodies orbiting in space.\n\"Guided by passive environmental strategies, the design process employed advanced computer simulations to test and refine the building's form, spaces and envelope for optimal performance within the annual solar radiation, temperatures, humidity, prevailing winds, air quality and other variable conditions of Shenzhen's subtropical climate and location,\" says ZHA. \"The building's orientation has been determined to minimize solar heat gain within its central atrium while maintaining panoramic views of the park.\"\nThe interior of the museum is massive and has a floorspace of 128,276 sq m (roughly 1.38 million sq ft). This is divided between permanent and temporary exhibition halls and galleries, as well as immersive theaters, cinemas, research laboratories, an innovation center, and visitor amenities. The decor is equally striking, continuing the futuristic aesthetic of the exterior.\nThough calling the Shenzhen Science & Technology Museum green would be a stretch, it offsets its Bigfoot-like carbon footprint with significant energy efficient design. Stainless-steel exterior panels create a ventilated cavity between the facade and the external walls, mitigating direct exposure to the elements and solar radiation. This system extends to the roof, which also incorporates solar panels for on-site power generation, reducing its draw on the power grid. The firm also says that the facade features a nano-scale oxide film, creating a \"self-protecting, self-cleaning micro-layer.\"\nAdditionally, its construction used a large amount of recyclable materials and the design includes a water management system that uses greywater recycling and collects and stores rainwater to greatly reduce its grid-based water usage.\nThe Shenzhen Science & Technology Museum's completion continues ZHA's focus on China under current studio head Patrik Schumacher, with notable recent works including the [Shenzhen Institute of Financial Technology](https://newatlas.com/architecture/zaha-hadid-architects-shenzhen-institute-financial-technology/) and [Zhuhai Jinwan Civic Art Centre](https://newatlas.com/architecture/zhuhai-jinwan-civic-art-centre-zaha-hadid/).\nSource: [Zaha Hadid Architects](https://www.zaha-hadid.com/2025/05/02/shenzhen-science-technology-museum-now-open/)\n[ View gallery - 8 images ](https://newatlas.com/architecture/zaha-hadid-shenzhen-science-technology-museum-opens/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Architecture](https://newatlas.com/architecture/)[Building and Construction](https://newatlas.com/tag/building+and+construction/)[Zaha Hadid](https://newatlas.com/tag/zaha-hadid/)[Museum](https://newatlas.com/tag/museum/)[China](https://newatlas.com/tag/china/)[Shenzhen](https://newatlas.com/tag/shenzhen/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Zaha%20Hadid%20Architects%27%20spaceship-like%20museum%20is%20shaped%20by%20the%20weather&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Farchitecture%2Fzaha-hadid-shenzhen-science-technology-museum-opens%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/architecture/zaha-hadid-shenzhen-science-technology-museum-opens/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\n[Adam Williams](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

BUT ... this bike is very special.\nIt was owned by John Surtees, the only person to win the world championship on both two and four wheels. It is one of a batch of 20 851 F90 Corsa Ducatis produced by the factory specifically for homologation purposes for the 1990 World Superbike season. Its landmark new technologies include being the first desmodromic v-twin with liquid cooling, 4 valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection.\nOne of the other bikes in the litter of 20 took the 1990 World Superbike Championship in the hands of Frenchman Raymond Roche, beginning a Ducati domination of world superbike racing that exists to this day.\nRace bikes are a lot like Grandpa's axe – by the time they've done a few seasons, there's not much left that remains of the original. Everything has been improved, resurfaced (intentionally or otherwise) or replaced. This bike is absolutely original because it is still new – as it would have been delivered to the teams, before they began changing everything chasing an extra millisecond in lap times.\nThe bike has never been started. Authenticity is key to collectible car and motorcycle value and this is as authentic and unmolested as a race bike can get, and it's rare and significant with great provenance ... and there is no reserve price.\nHence it will be sold, come what may. It's unlikely not to set a model record given the venue – Italy's annual Concorso D'Elegenza Villa D'Este is one of the key global events on the collectible car calendar and it has an accompanying auction at Villa Erba (next door) each year. The 851's remarkably full hand of auction attractiveness will not be overlooked in its home country.\nIf it doesn't set a record, someone got a bargain and here's why.\n## The Surtees Provenance\nThe provenance of Surtees is immense. His feats rate equal billing to those of Fangio.\nOnly one person has ever won the world championship for both cars and motorcycles and it is unlikely to ever happen again. John Surtees won the World 500cc Motorcycle Racing Championship (now MotoGP) in 1956, 1958, 1959 & 1960 riding for MV Agusta. In 1960, he had his first F1 start at the Monaco Grand Prix between his commitments to MV Agusta as its lead rider.\nIn a world where it is now difficult to swap between racing series due to the different riding and power characteristics of the bikes, Surtees won the 1958, 1959 and 1960 World 500cc Championship AND the 1960 World 350cc Championship riding in both classes at every Grand Prix.\nIn the same year (1960), Surtees managed to fit four Formula One starts into his crowded schedule. At his second start (the 1960 British Grand Prix), he finished second behind Jack Brabham, and his third start was the Portuguese Grand Prix where he put his Cooper Climax on pole ahead of Gurney, Brabham, Moss, Hill, McLaren and Jim Clark.\nNot surprisingly, by the beginning of 1961, he was a full-time Formula One driver and by the beginning of 1963 he was driving for Scuderia Ferrari, winning the Formula One championship for Ferrari in 1964.\nSurtees' 851 has quite potent provenance, but it serves to highlight the immense wealth of limited-edition Ducatis that have been slowly working their way up auction price lists for the last few decades.\n## The looming Ducati Auction Juggernaut\nDucati has produced so many coveted collectible motorcycles over the last 50 years, it's sometimes hard to keep track of the marque's continual presence at auction, but an analysis of the rising auction prices for a host of Ducati's legacy models suggests that Ducati is on track to ultimately dominate motorcycle auction prices in the same way Ferrari has dominated the collectible car marketplace.\n## Continued Relevance\nDucati is not a name that relies on the history books for its credibility.\nDucati currently dominates both Superbike and MotoGP racing – it generates priceless publicity most weekends by winning the world's most watched races, infusing the marque with ever-greater recognition and enhanced reputation. Sometimes it generates global publicity several times in one weekend, winning MotoGP sprints, and WSBK heats. In 2024 there were 20 Grands Prix that comprised the championship – that's 60 podium positions available of which Ducati took 56 of them. So far in 2025, Ducati has taken 14 of the 15 MotoGP podiums available.\nIt's extremely rare that a sportsperson comes along that is nigh on unbeatable in one of the world's most visible and hotly contested sports. Hiring Marc Marquez might turn out to be as significant an event for the Ducatisti as the 1972 Imola 200 Race or Mike Hailwood's post-retirement world championship ride at the Isle of Man. \nDucati's winning record in World Superbike Championships is already top of the list and in the most important racing series, the 500cc/MotoGP World Championship, Ducati and Marquez can surpass everyone in history – Giacomo Agostini and Valentino Rossi included – over the next few years. \nDucati is already nurturing the Ducatisti by enrolling former champions such as Carl Fogarty, Troy Bayliss, Casey Stoner, Regis Laconi, Troy Corser ad infinitum as tribal elders to promote the brand to new generations, and Ducati's mastery of technology includes a growing digital connection with its user base that appears to be next-generation savvy.\nDucati was following the same trajectory as Ferrari on the auction block before Marquez arrived. If Marquez starts relentlessly winning again, ([which seems likely](https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/motorcycles/motogp/agostinis-and-rossis-motogp-records-are-now-within-marquezs-grasp/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIR1VleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHfWLq_WsRBHzwrqGYZqIGgGZCkm2VU31Zv-mmhM_dp6kZIx4i2FKISKLUw_aem_PqtV8a-G7SySj_id4j4eQw) – the bookies currently have him at 1.25 odds to take the 2025 title), the marque will reap untold rewards from the synergetic partnership.\nThanks to a never ending supply of desirable limited production models (many of which won modern day World Championships), it has created dozens of collectible marketplaces for individual models which combine to form an auction juggernaut-in-waiting as these markets are all maturing and climbing above the radar.\nIn 2024, Casey Stoner's 2007 Championship-winning Ducati Desmosedici race bike [sold for $532,004 (£402,500)](https://www.iconicauctioneers.com/2007-ducati-desmosedici-gp7-rec13761-5-silverston-0824) to move into 14th place in the all-time highest motorcycle prices. The highest priced Brough Superior in history fetched just a tad more at $542,500. The Desmosedici is now the only motorcycle produced this century in the top 50 motorcycle prices of all time, and one of only three produced subsequent to 1960 – the others being the customized [1990 Harley-Davidson Softail Heritage 1340 ($520,024)](https://www.artcurial.com/ventes/4134/lots/187-a) of French rock-n-roll legend Johnny Hallyday, and the [1991 Harley-Davidson Fat Boy ($512,000)](https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/movie-tv-memorabilia/arnold-schwarzenegger-terminator-screen-used-1991-harley-davidson-fat-boy-motorcycle-from-terminator-2-judgment-day/a/997049-2324.s) used by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie [_Terminator 2: Judgement Day_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day).\nIn April 2024, one of the original Ducati 750 Imola racers that launched the brand into international consciousness in 1972 [reached $600,000 on the auction block](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/world-first-million-dollar-motorcycle/) but the reserve price (the price at which the vendor sells) was not reached. Had the bid been accepted, Ducati's imminent climb to the summit of auction rankings might already be common knowledge.\nThe Ducati 750 SS was Ducati's roadgoing replica of the famous Smart-Spaggiari bikes that finished 1-2 at the Imola 200 race in 1972. The previous time one of the original eight Ducati Imola race bikes sold at auction (Sotheby’s in September 2001), it set a world record price of $121,250 for a motorcycle at auction and the sale prompted _Cycle World_ Editor Phil Schilling to write an article entitled simply $100,000 Ducati.\n$100,000 seemed like a ridiculous amount of money for anyone to pay for a motorcycle at that time, but with a quarter century of hindsight, we can now say that 20 of the original batch of 1973/1974 Ducati 750SS roadgoing replicas have now sold in excess of the price of Spaggiari's history-making Ducati desmo v-twin race bike – the replicas sold for more than the real bike.

Not all bikes are equal once they've been cared for by different humans for 50 years, particularly motorcycles built to racing tolerances. Performance motorcycles are not appliances that will relentlessly perform their task without meticulous maintenance and we think that's why prices for the same Ducati model often vary more wildly than with other brands, and often the high price for a model is more so of an outlier. \nThe trends suggest that if you are prepared to invest in your Ducati for the longer term, it should provide a handsome return, even if you ride it. That's value beyond numbers in a spreadsheet!\nAfter an intensive preparation for this article, sorting through thousands of auction listings, it appears quite obvious that it's still possible to pick up an original model in excellent shape for a lot less than the museum quality bikes that set the price records.\n## The Hailwood Legend\nHigh on the awareness scale of every motorcycling enthusiast is the 1978 return to racing of the legendary seven-time World Champion \"Mike the Bike\" Hailwood. Hailwood had not raced for more than a decade when he was coaxed out of retirement, and his feat in returning to the ultra-dangerous Isle of Man circuit at 38-years-of-age and giving Ducati its first world title is integral to the Ducati legend.\nMike Hailwood's Isle of Man TT comeback in 1978\nHailwood's fairy tale triumph made global news and for a decade, it seemed every motorcycle workshop and man cave in the world was decorated with one of the many posters honoring his win. Not surprisingly, a replica of the Hailwood bike emerged and [Ian Falloon's history of the Mike Hailwood Replica](https://www.mcnews.com.au/ducati-mike-hailwood-replica-specifications/) is as meticulously detailed as usual, while [Alan Cathcart's backgrounder on the story is equally enlightening](https://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-italian-motorcycles/Mike-Hailwood-Ducati-Isle-Of-Man-TT-Steve-Wynne/).\nThe Hailwood Replica comes in several different guises, but just sticking to the none-Evoluzione models, the highest price in our records is [$56,175](https://iconicmotorbikeauctions.com/auction/1985-ducati-mhr-mille-with-1-mile/), followed by [$48,285](https://cars.bonhams.com/auction/26111/lot/344/1979-ducati-864cc-mike-hailwood-replica-frame-no-900013-engine-no-089441/?_gl=1*fz9z9g*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTY3NjcyNzk3Ni4xNzQ0Mzc3MDc4*_ga*MTYzNzAzNDk5LjE3MDM5MTc2ODU.*_ga_9FB4GWJE0X*czE3NDY3NTc5MTAkbzQ0NSRnMSR0MTc0Njc1ODEyMyRqMCRsMCRoMA..), [$42,156](https://www.iconicauctioneers.com/1979-ducati-mike-hailwood-replica-mk-1-rec11573-1-silverston-0822), [$38,801](https://www.handh.co.uk/auction/lot/lot-38---1979-ducati-864cc-mike-hailwood-replica/?lot=51195&so=6&st=Ducati%20Mike%20Hailwood%20Replica&sto=0&au=&ef=&et=&ic=False&sd=1&pp=48&pn=1&g=1) and then a drop to [$31,216](https://www.handh.co.uk/auction/lot/lot-198---1985-ducati-mille-mike-hailwood-replica/?lot=15370&so=6&st=Ducati%20Mike%20Hailwood%20Replica&sto=0&au=&ef=&et=&ic=False&sd=1&pp=48&pn=1&g=1), [$30,800](https://www.mecum.com/lots/1088615/1982-ducati-900-desmo-mike-hailwood-replica/?aa_id=458639-0) and [$30,750](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1979-ducati-900ss-mike-hailwood-replica/), and a plethora of sales in the $25,000 to $30,000 bracket.\nThe 1,500-unit limited edition Desmosedici RR race replica produced by Ducati in 2008 seemingly defied logic with its astronomical price of $72,000 (£40,000), but 17 years down the track, those who managed to procure one at that price now have a collectible motorcycle worth more than the original buy price, and from here onwards, it can be reasonably expected to appreciate in value far better than bank interest or pork belly futures.\nThe record price for a Desmosedici RR is $91,057, though there are rumors of much higher prices having been paid at auction that we cannot verify with a link or a media report. We calculate the total buy price, including buyers premium and we convert prices to USD at the prevailing exchange rates on the next trading day. Many auction houses do not list the full price (recording the hammer price but failing to add the Buyer's Premium) which is why the price we quote in this and many other articles is often different to the prices you will find on the auction site – just read their fine print about their Buyers Premium. If we can reasonably verify that a sale occurred, we list it. If anyone can help add to the database with a link to a sale not listed here, we'll add it to this article and we'll all be better informed.\nDesmosedici RR prices for spectacular specimens now comfortably exceed the initial buy price, with recent high prices of [$90,528](https://www.iconicauctioneers.com/2008-ducati-desmosedici-rr-rec14126-1-nec-1124), [$84,000](https://iconicmotorbikeauctions.com/auction/2008-ducati-desmosedici-rr-888-1500-with-1-mile/), [$78,750](https://iconicmotorbikeauctions.com/auction/2008-ducati-desmosedici-243/), [$78,355](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2009-ducati-desmosedici-rr-2), [$74,445](https://iconicmotorbikeauctions.com/auction/2008-ducati-desmosedici-669-2/) and [$73,028](https://iconicmotorbikeauctions.com/auction/2008-ducati-desmosedici-308-with-218-miles/).\nThe single-cylinder Ducati 550cc Supermono racing motorcycle was produced in limited quantities between 1993 and 1995. Just 67 Supermonos were built, using much of the technology Pierre Terblanche had already developed for the twin-cylinder 916. The single-cylinder, 4-valve, water-cooled 550cc engine produced 75 hp and the technical manager who turned Terblanche's design into reality was a young engineer who joined Ducati in 1991 immediately upon graduating in mechanical engineering from the University of Bologna. Claudio Domenicali is now the CEO of Ducati after holding positions such as Director of Product R&D, and General Manager of Operations and Product Development. He became CEO of Ducati Motor Holding in 2013. The Ducati ethos looks sound from any angle! \nMauro Lucchiari won the European Supermono Championship on the Supermono as intended, and Ducati won the Manufacturers' title, and the Supermono is now a hugely coveted model.\nThanks to the extensive use of composite materials such as carbon fiber and magnesium alloy, the Supermono weighed only 100 kg, and to say Ducati vastly underestimated demand is an understatement. The [highest price of $165,760 appears to be an outlier](https://www.goodingco.com/lot/1993-ducati-supermono/), with the [second highest price at $115,000](https://cars.bonhams.com/auction/25192/lot/26/1993-ducati-550cc-supermono-racing-motorcycle-frame-no-zdm550r000016-engine-no-zdm550w4000016/), and [the third highest at $97,000](https://www.handh.co.uk/auction/lot/lot-110---1993-ducati-supermono/?lot=4505&so=6&st=Ducati&sto=0&au=&ef=&et=&ic=False&sd=1&pp=96&pn=1&g=1). We don't think it is, and there are private sales for the bike tor higher figures that we can't verify. [Ducati honors the Supermono's unique history with its own web page](https://www.ducati.com/ww/en/heritage/bikes/supermono).\nThe[ Ducati 888 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_888)was manufactured between 1991 and 1994 with 7,594 bikes produced. The 851 had introduced liquid cooling, computerized fuel injection and four-valve heads and for 1991 the engine capacity was increased to 888 cc. The 1990 World Superbike title was won by the 851, and the 888 took the title for Ducati in both 1991 and 1992, both years piloted by American Doug Polen. In 1991, Polen rode the _Fast by Ferracci_ Ducati 888 and in 1992, he rode the _Team Police_ Ducati.\nIn terms of sale prices, the highest price we record for the model is [$75,564,](https://rmsothebys.com/auctions/mc12/lots/r622-1992-ducati-888-sbk-corsa/) but the highest prices quickly drop away: [$65,515](https://www.iconicauctioneers.com/1994-ducati-888-corse-926cc-rec12076-2-excel-0223), [$63,969](https://cars.bonhams.com/auction/21897/lot/245/still-in-original-crate-as-new-condition-1989-ducati-888cc-lucchinelli-replica-racing-motorcycle-frame-no-zdm851s-850126/?_gl=1*19ltry1*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTY3NjcyNzk3Ni4xNzQ0Mzc3MDc4*_ga*MTYzNzAzNDk5LjE3MDM5MTc2ODU.*_ga_9FB4GWJE0X*czE3NDY0MjY1MjgkbzQyMyRnMCR0MTc0NjQyNjUyOCRqMCRsMCRoMA..), [$44,000](https://www.mecum.com/lots/362349/1991-ducati-888-corsa/), [$43,050](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1992-ducati-888-sp4-2/) and [$42,456.](https://cars.bonhams.com/auction/18294/lot/359/one-owner-from-new-zero-miles1989-ducati-888cc-lucchinelli-replica-frame-no-zdm851sx850188x-engine-no-zdm851w4x850188x/?_gl=1*egkv7k*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3NDA3MjYwMjIuQ2p3S0NBaUF0NEMtQmhCY0Vpd0E4S3AwQ2JrclF6TWZuN1RyS0NYa0R6TVVZZTJ1VU16WDVvOXBNbGRqeUQzT19LYTVTMVBjaGpiaWtCb0NtVllRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTY3NjcyNzk3Ni4xNzQ0Mzc3MDc4*_ga*MTYzNzAzNDk5LjE3MDM5MTc2ODU.*_ga_9FB4GWJE0X*czE3NDY0NDA0ODMkbzQyNCRnMSR0MTc0NjQ0MDg4NyRqMCRsMCRoMA..)\nThe [Ducati 916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_916) was made from 1994 to 1998, winning four of the five World Superbike titles it contested (three to Carl Fogarty, one to Troy Corser). Beyond its competitiveness, it is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful motorcycles ever made. It was one of the 100 motorcycles chosen for the famous [1998 Guggenheim \"Art of the Motorcycle\" Exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motorcycles_in_The_Art_of_the_Motorcycle_exhibition) (along with the 750 SS, Ducati Monster and Bimota Tesi ID) but ... judge for yourself.

The third highest price of $44,988 (€43,200) was paid for a bike with 6,000 km on the clock, and below that there are a dozen 996 that have sold in the $30,000 to $40,000 bracket.\nThe Matrix Reloaded: Trinity on Ducati 996\nThe 996's biggest moment in its three year reign, was not its two World Superbike titles (one to Fogarty, one to Bayliss), but as one of the stars of the movie, _Matrix Reloaded_. \nThe movie and the stunts performed, made the 996 look like the chariot of the gods. The movie further enhanced the growing Ducati reputation and is no doubt an influence on 996 prices, but Ducati's subsequent 998 Matrix Replica is a bike we think will do exceedingly well at auction as time goes by.\nThe [Ducati 998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_998) was produced from 2002 to 2004. It was the successor to the [Ducati 996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_996) and the final variation on the [Ducati 916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_916). The new [Testastretta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_Desmoquattro_motorcycles) engine shared many similarities with the previous Desmoquattro engine in the 996, although it was completely new from the [crankshaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft) up. Testastretta means narrow head and refers to a complete redesign of the [cylinder heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_head).

Even though the 999 represents a modern motorcycle with production taking place between 2002 and 2006, prices are already on the rise, with sales beyond the top seller indicating that near perfection is required to enter the top bracket of [$47,866](https://rmsothebys.com/auctions/mu22/lots/r0019-2006-ducati-999r/), [$47,501](https://rmsothebys.com/auctions/tv16/lots/r2006-2009-ducati-1098r-bayliss/), [$46,880](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2005-ducati-999r) and [$42,356](https://www.iconicauctioneers.com/2006-ducati-999r-rec11793-1-nec-1122?ss=true), with a step down to [$32,550](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2006-ducati-999r-xerox-2/) and $30,800 and then a host of sales in the $20,000 to $30,000 bracket.\nFour of the top five prices fetched by the Ducati 1098 at auction were achieved by Troy Bayliss replicas, with the highest price fetched in Italy by RM Sotheby's at [$47,172](https://rmsothebys.com/auctions/tv16/lots/r2006-2009-ducati-1098r-bayliss/), followed by four sales in Australia at [$43,817](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2009-ducati-1098r-troy-bayliss-1), [$41,149](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2008-ducati-1098r-6), [$35,960](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2009-ducati-1098r-troy-bayliss-2) and [$32,381](https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2009-ducati-1098r-troy-bayliss-3).\nThere are so many bikes we could and will add to this list to decipher the high prices, as time permits. In particular, the 1970s 750/900 Super Sport market, Darmah, Pantah, the MH900E Evoluzione and the Monster are on our list, but if you have a particular bike you'd like first, use the comments and we'll oblige.\n## The punchline\nNot convinced about the Ducati auction juggernaut theory yet? \nAround 75% of the world's 1,000 most valuable motorcycles are v-twins. \nLess than 1% of all the motorcycles ever sold have been v-twins, so we're not expecting the top of the auction leaderboard to primarily comprise anything but v-twins in 10, 20 or 30 years from now. \nHarley-Davidson and Ducati have been the major suppliers of newer v-twins to the auction block for decades, and Ducati's hit parade is now maturing, with all the boxes ticked, plus ongoing world dominance in a major spectator sport.\nThere are myriad Ducati models that have formed the basis of World Superbike Championships – the global premier category for production-based bikes. In 2023, the total number of Ducati World Superbike race wins surpassed 400, the number of podiums surpassed 1,000 (a result never achieved by any manufacturer in any motorcycle racing discipline) and five generations of Ducati super sport v-twins have contributed to writing the history of modern-day motorcycle racing culture.\nTop-of-mind name recognition counts for a lot on the auction block, and although the Ducatis winning everything at the racetrack are now V4s, all significant Ducatis can all be considered gilt-edged long term investments because Ducati is still winning and gives every indication it will continue to do so. \nEvery time a Ducati greets the checkered flag first, these heritage bikes are building long-term foundations to become valuable keepsakes.\n[ View gallery - 21 images ](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/ducati-auction-juggernaut/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Motorcycles](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/)[Auction](https://newatlas.com/tag/auction/)[Ducati](https://newatlas.com/tag/ducati/)[Collecting](https://newatlas.com/tag/collecting/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Surtees%27%20Ducati%20851%20highlights%20Ducati%27s%20auction%20surge&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fmotorcycles%2Fducati-auction-juggernaut%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/ducati-auction-juggernaut/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/mike-hanlon/)\n[Mike Hanlon](https://newatlas.com/author/mike-hanlon/)\nAs a photojournalist, Mike’s work has been published in a dozen languages across 20+ countries.

Japanese hardware brand Titaner's new heavy duty EDC knife features what it's calling the world's first dual-lock system to prevent that from ever happening, in an ergonomic, adjustable titanium design.\nYou'll need to slide a latch, and also press a button to flip the blade open. Both actions produce an audible click, so you know for sure when the blade has fully folded out to 175 degrees. At that point, Titaner says it's secure enough to hold up an 11 lb (5 kg) weight.\nThe company also says it's designed the frame for a high degree of stability while cutting, so the blade won't wobble and you can work precisely on materials like leather. Plus, the blade doesn't come in contact with the frame when it's folded shut, so it doesn't wear down and dull over time.\nYou can swap out blades easily and without additional tools, and replacements from brands like Stanley, Deli, and Woodpecker will fit just fine. And if you want to adjust the play on the folding knife so it opens more smoothly or stays put when in use, you can loosen or tighten the pivot screw with an Allen wrench.\nThe Ti folding knife features a clip to securely snap on to your clothing or bag, and weighs just 2.93 oz (83 g). It measures 3.92 inches (99.5 mm) in length, is under an inch thick, so it should easily slide into most pockets. Made from Gr5 titanium, it's as strong as steel, and highly corrosion resistant.\nWhat's neat about this knife is its thoroughly detailed build: there are more than 30 components in total, with the internals heat treated for wear resistance, and chamfered edges on most of the external metal parts. You'll even find a textured section on the handle to give you a better grip, and a lanyard slot that blends in with the frame's angular design.\nAll that comes at a substantial price, though. Titaner says the Ti folding knife will retail at US$399, but it's currently discounted on Kickstarter, where [its crowdfunding campaign lists the knife at an introductory pledge level of $229](https://titaner-4.kckb.me/e3dc7d4d). That does not include shipping (fees will be calculated separately by region after the campaign concludes by the end of May), or customs duties that will vary by country. It still isn't cheap, but it should last you a long time indeed.\nYou can get the knife in either a standard sandblasted titanium finish, or a Deep Obsidian Black matte finish applied through an oxidation process for a little extra. You can also add on glowing tritium vials that slot into the frame, and paracord for the lanyard slot.\nAll crowdfunding campaigns carry an element of risk, but assuming this one goes without a hitch, worldwide shipping is estimated to start from July.

The Oztent Apex RT-P-1600 tent joins the ARB [Altitude](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/arb-altitude-powered-rooftop-glamping-tent/) and [now-repurposed](https://newatlas.com/automotive/redtail-skyloft-camper-van/) Redtail Overland [Skyloft](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/redtail-carbon-roof-top-camper/) in that upper echelon of wheel-less micro-camping trailers that ride on the roof instead of behind the car. The new tent from Oz boasts motion-activated camp lighting, active cooling and even its own RV-style electronic command center. \nAustralia seems to be leading the new charge into a rooftop tent luxury segment. Excluding the Redtail Skyloft, which seemed to have overshot any potential market at all, the first example we saw was last year's US$5,000 ARB Altitude. That tall, boxy two-person hardshell boasted power deployment, integrated interior lighting, a multi-speed ceiling fan, a central command center for controlling the electrical bits, and an innovative retractable staircase in place of a common ladder. It was certainly a marvel, even if we weren't entirely convinced it was worth the price premium or hulking 232-lb (105-kg) weight. \nOztent makes an official countermove with the Apex 1600, a similarly high-priced panoramic hardshell RTT that brings its own set of homey touches, distinct from the Altitude but just as over-the-top. The Australian camping gear maker stakes some new ground in the lighting department, adding a more extensive set of lights that includes not only interior strip lights but also adjustable touch-sensitive gooseneck reading lights for both occupants and six exterior spotlights. \nThe exterior lights even include motion sensors for automatically turning on to enhance visibility and security around camp. Various modes, colors and tints let campers adjust the interior and exterior lighting to their needs. For instance, there's a camp mode for using the spotlights as base camp area lighting and a security mode that relies on the sensors to flip the lights on full blast for a minute in an effort to ward off any human or animal campsite intrusion. \nLike ARB, Oztent includes fans in its build, but instead of a ceiling fan, it uses two corner-mounted units with angle adjustment and three speed settings. The individual fans and adjustable angling seem nice additions for better fine-tuning one's comfort at night. \nTo control all those features without having to bounce around from light to fan to lamp, the Apex includes an illuminated command center. It's not quite the app-connected smart home control system of [some modern RVs](https://newatlas.com/tag/smart-rv/), but it does offer a central place for adjusting all of the light and fan settings. Also included as part of the console is a strip of USB charging ports, and Oztent packages in a remote control so you don't have to budge a centimeter from your campaign chair or down comforter to switch settings. \nDid someone ask where the entertainment system is? No ... well that's okay because the Apex doesn't conceal a pop-out TV or integrated audio system. It does, however, have a ceiling tablet holder designed to hold a mobile screen in place through whatever movies or content you want to watch through a rainy day or just before nodding off. \nMaybe Apex 2.0 will bring its own A/V hardware, hopefully something Scandinavian on the speaker side. \nPower for all those features, and for charging one's tablet-TV, comes from the user's own power station or power pack. We'd have thought Oztent would chip in the pack since most of the tent's distinguishing features rely on it, but perhaps it figures the kind of rootless nomad looking at this type of RTT already has a surplus of their own. The company does include a designated pouch to store said pack right next to the command center plug-in. \nThe Apex lacks a few of the features found on the ARB Altitude, starting with electric actuation. It pitches via a good old combination of manual lifting and strut assist. It also features a more common telescoping ladder compared to ARB\"s innovative fold-out staircase. \nAs far as actual tent-camping features, the Apex 1600 has a full panoramic array of windows with mesh and roll-up closures, a 2.8-in (7-cm) high-density foam mattress, two integrated cup/bottle holders, storage pockets around the lower walls and ceiling, and outer mounting track for accessories like a shoe storage bag. The poly-cotton ripstop tent walls are sandwiched between a thermoplastic cover and a fiberglass honeycomb base with powder-coated aluminum frame. The whole shebang weighs in at 238 lb (108 kg) – not surprising given its feature set but quite a hefty load for a two-person RTT. \nThe Apex price tag comes in at AU$5,999 (approx. US$3,850), well cheaper than the AU$7,249 the ARB Altitude started at when it launched a year ago. Each tent has its own selling points if you're into the idea of an ultra-glampy rooftop tent, but at some point, it seems you'd be better off pulling that excess off the roof and putting money into a proper travel trailer or camper van. \nOztent does have a large [US presence](https://oztent.com/), but it does not currently advertise any rooftop tent models for the market. Americans know how to overspend on lavish overlanding gear they may or may never actually need, though, so it seems like the Apex would be ripe for a US launch at some point. Then again, tariffs. We'll see. \nHave a closer look at the Oztent Apex 1600 and its various amenities in the video below. \nOZTENT Apex RT-P-1600 Roof Top Tent\nSource: [Oztent](https://www.oztent.com.au/products/apex-rt-p-1600-roof-top-tent)\n[ View gallery - 17 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/luxe-glamping-tent-is-like-a-mini-rv/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[roof-top tent](https://newatlas.com/tag/roof-top-tent/)[Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/)[Outdoors and Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/)[Tent](https://newatlas.com/tag/tent/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Deluxe%20glamping%20tent%20is%20a%20mini%20smart%20cube%20camper%20for%20the%20car%20rooftop&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fluxe-glamping-tent-is-like-a-mini-rv%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/luxe-glamping-tent-is-like-a-mini-rv/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/c-c-weiss/)\n[C.C.

The modular apparatus is claimed to capture as much as 70% of the CO2 emissions from cargo ship exhaust systems.\nWhether because of environmental concerns or a self-interest in economic survival, shipping companies are showing an increasing interest in new ways of reducing their carbon emissions. In 2022, cargo ships accounted for 858 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, with lager ships making up 79% of that figure. On the whole, the shipping sector is estimated to produce up to 3% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions and with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is aiming at a net-zero target by 2050. With fines after that date of up to US$380 per tonne of unsanctioned carbon, emission reduction technologies are drawing a lot of attention these days.\nSince 2019, Wärtsilä has been developing its CCS system for recovering CO2 from the exhausts of cargo ships burning all manner of fuels. The technology itself isn't new. The various bits and bobs that make it up have been used by the gas, oil, and chemical industries for decades, but converting it into a modular system that is scalable and can be both fitted into new ships and retrofitted into existing ones is certainly worth sitting up and taking notice of. In addition, its modular design means that it can be easily modified to suit ships that already have exhaust scrubbing systems.\nThe CCS is essentially a five-stage process. First, the exhaust gas from the ship's engines is cleaned of particulate matter like soot and pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. After cleaning and cooling, the exhaust then goes into an absorption chamber where a liquid amine solvent absorbs the CO2. Exactly what this solvent is remains proprietary information, but it's likely some variant on monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and piperazine-based blends.\nOnce absorption is completed, the solvent moves to a stripping chamber, where it is heated. This releases the CO2 as a gas. This is compressed, dried, and cooled until it liquefies. It's then stored in onboard tanks for later offloading in port.\nAccording to the company, this process can recover as much as 70% of the CO2. Exactly how much this costs is unclear, but estimates place it at between €50 to €70 (US$54 to $76) – a lot cheaper than the future fines. If the technology plays out and is adopted worldwide, it could reduce emissions by up to 700 million tonnes per year.\nThe CCS system was installed in the Solvang ASA 21,000-m3 (741,609-ft3) capacity ethylene carrier _Clipper Eris_ , which has been testing the full installation since February 2025 when it sailed from Singapore. During these tests, the CSS was able to process 50 tonnes of CO2 per day from the engines burning heavy fuel oil – an economical, but rather dirty fossil fuel.\n\"CCS is a game-changer for the maritime industry, and we are already seeing huge interest in the market for this solution,\" said Håkan Agnevall, President and CEO of Wärtsilä. \"Ahead of shipping’s net-zero targets, this new technology complements the industry’s ongoing efforts to dramatically reduce emissions from vessels and prevent stranded assets.\n\"Collaboration has been key here. To achieve this significant advance in maritime emissions control it is important to be able to cooperate with like-minded partners such as Solvang ASA. We congratulate them for their vision and support in bringing CCS to their fleet.\"\nSource: [Wärtsilä](https://www.wartsila.com/media/news/07-05-2025-wartsila-launches-carbon-capture-solution-to-shipping-market-after-world-first-full-scale-installation-success-3582634)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/environment/carbon-capture-system-cuts-cargo-ship-emissions-70/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Environment](https://newatlas.com/environment/)[Ships](https://newatlas.com/tag/ship/)[Carbon capture](https://newatlas.com/tag/carbon-capture/)[Shipping](https://newatlas.com/tag/shipping/)[Transport](https://newatlas.com/tag/transport/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Modular%20carbon%20capture%20tech%20slashes%20cargo%20ship%20CO2%20emissions%20by%2070%25&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fenvironment%2Fcarbon-capture-system-cuts-cargo-ship-emissions-70%2F)\n\n\n[ 3 comments ](https://newatlas.com/environment/carbon-capture-system-cuts-cargo-ship-emissions-70/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\n[David Szondy](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\nDavid Szondy is a playwright, author and journalist based in Seattle, Washington.

The average rate of vertical land motion (VLM) for 28 cities as evaluated; each circle is color-coded for average VLM \nColumbia University\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/environment/28-us-cities-sinking/#gallery:1)\nAn alarming new report reveals that right across the country, 28 US cities are sinking, showing the kind of geologic subsidence that could impact buildings and infrastructure sooner rather than later. While some of it is natural, 80% is the the direct result of human activity.\nA large team of researchers including geoscientists from Virginia Tech and Columbia University used satellite-based radar measurements to assess areas of shifting land, and found that from coast to coast, there was significant movement in both large and small urban hubs. And in 25 of the 28 cities, at least 65% of the urban area is sinking.\n\"Even slight downward shifts in land can significantly compromise the structural integrity of buildings, roads, bridges, and railways over time,\" said Leonard Ohenhen, former Virginia Tech graduate student and the study’s lead author.\nOne place, however, is outpacing the others – Houston, Texas. The large southern city is in a bad way overall, but the study revealed that 42% of land area is currently sinking by more than 5 mm (0.2 inches) each year, with 12% subsiding by more than 10 mm (0.4 in) a year. That may not seem like a whole lot if you're only looking at 12 months of data, but over a decade, 10 mm of subsidence poses a significant structural threat to the built environment, particularly if that sinking is uneven.\n“Unlike flood-related subsidence hazards, where risks manifest only when high rates of subsidence lower the land elevation below a critical threshold, subsidence-induced infrastructure damage can occur even with minor changes in land motion,” the researchers noted in the study.\nTexas had the three most rapidly sinking cities of the 28, with Fort Worth and Dallas behind Houston. It's no real surprise, given the state's climate, growth, intensive groundwater use for the population as well as agriculture and industry, and oil and gas extraction. \nThe three cities sit on clay-rich soil, which is prone to naturally expanding when wet and shrinking quickly when dry, which makes the land beneath these urban places particularly susceptible to subsidence. Adding to this, pumping groundwater lowers underground water pressure, which sees clay soils contract and compact – which, as you can probably guess, is not good news for what's on the surface. What's more, the weight of infrastructure and drought conditions further impact these clay-rich soils.\nWhile Houston is still sinking, it's nothing compared to past patterns where unregulated groundwater pumping saw, at its peak, the city subside nearly 5 cm (2 in) each year. This led to an [overhaul of the system](https://texaslivingwaters.org/houston-subsidence-mapping-tool/) to mitigate the damage.\nOther cities high on the list of 28 include Chicago, New York, Seattle, Denver and Detroit. Overall, the urban areas house around 34 million people. And scientists are concerned that because it's not as immediately impactful as a natural disaster like a hurricane or flood, it's easier (and cheaper) to ignore it.\n\"The latent nature of this risk means that infrastructure can be silently compromised over time with damage only becoming evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic,\" said Manoochehr Shirzaei. \"This risk is often exacerbated in rapidly expanding urban centers.\"\nOther areas of concern for researchers included around New York’s LaGuardia Airport, where the land was sinking more rapidly than elsewhere in the state, and sections of Las Vegas, Washington, DC. and San Francisco. \nAnd it's not just infrastructure to worry about; any loss of ground leaves area more vulnerable to flooding – an extreme weather event that is only expected to be more prevalent as the planet heats. New York, Chicago, LA, Phoenix, Houston, Philadelphia, San Antonio and Dallas have, collectively, experienced more than 90 flooding events since 2000.\nLast month, another study delved into the geological processes behind [North America's subsiding problem](https://newatlas.com/science/north-america-is-sinking-down-into-the-earths-mantle/), which is worth a read if you're not yet catastrophe-ed out.\nHowever, the US is certainly not alone, with [China facing the same issue](https://newatlas.com/environment/urban-china-subsidence/), as well as [Venice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282421952_Venice_Rising_Water_or_Sinking_Land) – which has so far lost around 23 cm (9 in) – and Mexico City, where some areas are shockingly sinking at a rate of around 50 cm (1.6 ft) each year. \nBut as Houston's mitigation measures show, intervention is key. The scientists of the latest study point out that measures such as land raising, better drainage and even constructing artificial wetlands can lower floodwater impact. \n“As opposed to just saying it’s a problem, we can respond, address, mitigate, adapt,” said Ohenhen. “We have to move to solutions.”\nThe researchers are the latest group of scientists urging law and policymakers to act now rather than wait for the consequences down the line.\n\"Targeted mitigation through strategic dam planning, managed aquifer recharge, and resource extraction policies may be useful to control, pause, or even reverse subsidence,\" they wrote. \"Ultimately, a robust and sustainable mitigative and adaptive framework should encompass continuous monitoring, stakeholder collaboration, and flexible management plans.\"\nThe whole 28 cities, in order from most rapid ground changes, are:\n  1. Houston, TX\n  2. Fort Worth, TX\n  3. Dallas, TX\n  4. Chicago, IL\n  5. New York, NY\n  6. Denver, CO\n  7. Seattle, WA\n  8. Columbus, OH\n  9. Indianapolis, IN\n  10. Charlotte, NC\n  11.

However, new research has found that low blood sugar may also contribute. The good news is that it also identified a way of preventing or treating the damage.\nIt’s well-known that hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, is associated with eye problems in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Consistently high blood sugar levels can damage the [small blood vessels](https://newatlas.com/medical/novel-drug-prevents-retinopathy-kidney-complications-diabetic-mice/) in the eyes, which affects the retina, the part of the eye that senses light and sends images to the brain. Over time, this damage can lead to [diabetic retinopathy](https://newatlas.com/medical/led-contact-lens-diabetes-blindness/), where these blood vessels leak fluid or bleed, resulting in vision loss.\nNow, a new study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine’s [Wilmer Eye Institute](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer) has suggested that low blood sugars also contribute to eye damage and vision loss in cases of diabetic retinopathy. They also identify an experimental drug that may help.\n“These studies help explain why patients with diabetes who are initially started on tight glucose control, the cornerstone of diabetic management, or those who have high glycemic variability (transient episodes of very low – followed by very high – serum glucose levels) experience worsening of their diabetic eye disease,” said the study’s corresponding author, [Akrit Sodhi, MD, PhD](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/akrit-sodhi/2700469), associate professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University [School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som) and the Wilmer Eye Institute.\nThe researchers conducted their experiments on diabetic mice. They found that low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, resulted in an accumulation of [hypoxia-inducible factor-1⍺](https://newatlas.com/diabetic-foot-ulcer-skin-patch/34468/) (HIF-1⍺) and HIF-2⍺. Both are transcription factors: proteins that help control the process of turning specific genes on or off. HIF-1⍺ and HIF-2⍺ play a key role in the body’s response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). When oxygen is scarce, HIF-1⍺ is activated and turns on genes that help cells survive and maintain energy production. HIF-2⍺ has a slightly different role; it influences how cells grow and divide under hypoxic conditions.\nWhen hypoglycemia was induced in diabetic mice, it caused the accumulation of these transcription factors, which triggered the expression of other HIF-dependent proteins. This led to the overgrowth and leakage of blood vessels in the retina, leading, in turn, to irreversible damage and vision loss. Inducing hypoglycemia in non-diabetic mice did not result in higher levels of HIF.\nThe researchers then tested an experimental drug called [32-134D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37227777/), which inhibits the HIF-1⍺ and HIF-2⍺ proteins. The drug, injected prior to induced hypoglycemia into the mice’s vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the eyeball, prevented the increased expression of HIF-dependent proteins responsible for causing retinal damage. They say that these findings pave the way for human clinical trials assessing the safety and effectiveness of 32-134D in treating diabetic retinopathy.\n“Our findings underscore why therapies targeting HIF will be an effective approach to prevent or treat diabetic retinopathy,” Sodhi said.\nThe study was published in the journal [_Science Translational Medicine_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq5355).\nSource: [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2025/05/low-blood-sugar-contributes-to-eye-damage-and-vision-loss-in-diabetic-retinopathy-experimental-drug-may-help-treat-condition)\n## Tags\n[Diabetes](https://newatlas.com/diabetes/)[Type 1 diabetes](https://newatlas.com/tag/type-1-diabetes/)[Type 2 diabetes](https://newatlas.com/tag/type-2-diabetes/)[Diabetic retinopathy](https://newatlas.com/tag/diabetic-retinopathy/)[Blindness](https://newatlas.com/tag/blindness/)[Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://newatlas.com/tag/johns-hopkins-medicine/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Low%20blood%20sugars%20%28as%20well%20as%20high%29%20cause%20blindness%20in%20diabetics&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fdiabetes%2Fhypoglycemia-diabetic-retinopathy-experimental-treatment%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/diabetes/hypoglycemia-diabetic-retinopathy-experimental-treatment/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\n[Paul McClure](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\nPaul brings extensive knowledge and real-world experience to New Atlas.

Such is not the case with a new mini-dog-bot, however, which is an expert at doing the dog-paddle.\nKnown appropriately enough as the Amphibious Robot Dog (ARD), the four-legged device measures 300 mm long by 100 mm wide (11.8 by 3.9 in) and tips the scales at 2.25 kg (5 lb). It was created by a team of scientists led by professors Yunquan Li and Ye Chen from the South China University of Technology.\nOn land, the robot's double-jointed legs adopt a trotting gait, taking it to a top speed of 1.2 BL/s (body-lengths per second). Swimming in the water, it still manages a decent 0.54 BL/s. For comparison, previous research indicates that _actual_ pooches top out at about 1.4 BL/s when dog-paddling.\nImportantly, ARD wasn't just built to be a waterproof, floating quadruped. The scientists made a point of balancing its center of gravity and center of buoyancy, in order to \"ensure stable and effective aquatic performance.\" They also experimented with three different swimming styles.\nTwo of these, called \"lateral sequence paddling gaits\" (LSPGs), were essentially variations on the dog-paddle. As the name suggests, they involved moving the four legs in a lateral sequence/cycle – left-front then left-rear, followed by right-front then right-rear.\nThe difference between the two LSPG gaits lay in what proportion of the cycle each leg spent in the \"power phase\" (PP), in which it was fully extended for maximum thrust. In one gait, each leg moved completely on its own, for a PP proportion of 25%. In the other – which was more like the natural dog-paddle – there was some overlap between leg movements, for a PP proportion of 33%\nAmphibious Robot Dog\nThe third swimming style was a \"trot-like paddling gait\" (TLPG) in which diagonally-opposed pairs of legs moved at the same time – left-front/right-rear, then right-front/left-rear – for a 50% PP proportion.\nPool tests showed that the 33% LSPG delivered the fastest swimming speed of 0.54 BL/s, followed closely by the 25% LSPG. The TLPG was the slowest of the three, but it was also the most stable.\n\"This innovation marks a big step forward in designing nature-inspired robots,\" says Prof. Li. \"Our robot dog’s ability to efficiently move through water and on land is due to its bioinspired trajectory planning, which mimics the natural paddling gait of real dogs.\"\nA paper on the research was recently published in the journal [_Bioinspiration & Biomimetics_](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/adcd1b).\nSource: [IOP Publishing](https://ioppublishing.org/news/robotic-dog-mimics-mammals-for-superior-mobility-on-land-and-in-water/)\n## Tags\n[Robotics](https://newatlas.com/robotics/)[Quadruped](https://newatlas.com/tag/quadruped/)[Biomimicry](https://newatlas.com/tag/biomimicry/)[Swimming](https://newatlas.com/tag/swimming/)[Amphibious](https://newatlas.com/tag/amphibious/)[locomotion](https://newatlas.com/tag/locomotion/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Swimming%20robot%20conjures%20its%20inner%20canine%20to%20perfect%20the%20art%20of%20dog-paddling&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Frobotics%2Fswimming-quadruped-robot%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/swimming-quadruped-robot/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

In fact, it brings over 50 years' experience in the category. Now it's taking that grandmaster-level expertise of freshly honed edges to a lineup of knives all its own. Instead of merely leaning on its brand name to sell a basic blade, it's doing things a little differently. Each knife in the company's debut lineup features an interchangeable pivot that transforms operation from automatic to manual (and vice versa) on a whim. \nCalled the RMX – for Replaceable Mechanism Exchange – Work Sharp's first-ever knife series features a gold disc joint that proves an immediate visual focal point. And that's because it's the cornerstone of the entire design, the piece that gives the RMX series its name and makes it special. \nWith a couple of twists of the included 2-mm hex wrench, the gold pivot mechanism removes and swaps out hardware via what Work Sharp says is the first-ever interchangeable pivot cartridge. This allows the user to easily switch between manual and push-button blade deployment. \nAs to why you'd want to switch between the two modes, each style has its own set of advantages and may be preferable for different situations or tasks. The most obvious that comes to mind is that automatic knives, often called switchblades, are illegal in various countries around the world, as well as individual states in the USA. In some jurisdictions, they're legal but more heavily regulated than manual folders. \nBeing able to switch between the two operations should make the knife compliant with local regulations wherever one happens to be, which could be quite helpful when traveling, camping in other states or countries, etc. Install the manual pivot cartridge, and the knife is a manual folder. \nBeyond legal issues, the automatic push-button option promotes fast, smooth one-handed blade deployment, whereas a manual mechanism promotes simpler slow-and-steady operation. If you happen to prefer the different styles for different purposes, a knife that can quickly switch modes is a handy dual-function design to add to your toolbox. We've seen knife models that come in the buyer's choice of manual or automatic operation, but the RMX series takes that a step further with a single unit that can switch between the two operating modes. \nPlus, plenty of people just like collecting different knives and everyday carry tools, and this is certainly a distinctive style to add to the cache. \nBeyond its quick-swapping pivot, the RMX series features an integral handle crafted from a single piece of magnesium and a thin, ultra-sharp blade made from CPM-3V or M390 steel, depending on model. The CPM-3V finds use in a full-size Reverse Tanto that Work Sharp promises as \"razor-thin\" and \"ultra-slicey,\" built for both precision cutting and everyday usage. The M390 goes into full-size and compact Drop Point knives. \n\"RMX knives were engineered for real-world use – whether at a desk, on a job site or in the field,\" promised Work Sharp lead engineer Dan Dovel in this week's sneak-peek announcement. \"Every detail, from the modular pivot to the integral handle, supports practical everyday carry – fast, functional and built to perform without unnecessary complexity.\" \nWe'll take a closer look at individual model specs and pricing when Work Sharp launches the first knives on June 6, but if you want to get in early on the first round of limited production you can [sign up for notifications](https://worksharptools.com/pages/rmx-knives). \nSource: [Work Sharp](https://worksharptools.com/)\n[ View gallery - 7 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/work-sharp-rmx-hybrid-folding-knife/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[Knife](https://newatlas.com/tag/knife/)[Multitools](https://newatlas.com/tag/multi-tools/)[EDC](https://newatlas.com/tag/edc/)[Outdoors and Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/)[Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/)[Modular](https://newatlas.com/tag/modular/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Ultra-slicey%20switchblade%20morphs%20into%20manual%20folder%20at%20swap%20of%20a%20joint&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fwork-sharp-rmx-hybrid-folding-knife%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/work-sharp-rmx-hybrid-folding-knife/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/c-c-weiss/)\n[C.C.

Swiss scientists have gone a step better than that, with li'l robots that can be consumed by fish when their job is done.\nWe've already seen a number of experimental \"[microbots](https://newatlas.com/robotics/self-healing-swimming-microbots/)\" that can be equipped with sensors and other electronics, then turned loose to wander the wilderness while recording and/or transmitting environmental data.\nIn most cases, the idea is that when their mission is complete, the tiny, inexpensive devices will simply be abandoned. With that fact in mind, their bodies tend to be made largely out of biodegradable materials. That said, non-biodegradable plastics and toxic chemicals often still factor into their construction.\nProf. Dario Floreano, PhD student Shuhang Zhang and colleagues at Switzerland's EPFL university set out to change that, with their new aquatic robots. Each motorboat-shaped bot is about 5 cm long (2 in), weighs an average of 1.43 grams, and can travel at one-half to three body lengths per second.\nOh yes, and they're made out of fish food.\nMore specifically, their hulls are made out of commercial fish feed pellets that have been ground into a powder, mixed with a biopolymer binder, poured into a boat-shaped mold, then freeze-dried.\nIn the center of each robot's body is a chamber filled with a nontoxic powdered mixture of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate (aka baking soda). That chamber is sealed with a gel plug on the bottom of the hull, and connected to a propylene-glycol-filled microfluidic reservoir that forms the top layer of the robot's body.\nEco-friendly aquatic robot is made from fish food (water-triggered fuel expulsion)\nOnce the bot has been placed on the water's surface, water gradually starts making its way through the semi-permeable plug. When that water mixes with the powder in the chamber, a chemical reaction occurs, producing CO2 gas. That gas expands into the reservoir, pushing the glycol out of a hole in the back end of the robot.\nIn a phenomenon known as the [Marangoni effect](https://newatlas.com/chemical-gps/34446/), the expelled glycol reduces the surface tension of the surrounding water, pushing the robot forward as it does so – aquatic insects such as water striders utilize this same effect. And importantly, the glycol isn't toxic.\nSo how might these robots actually be utilized?\nWell, initially a batch of them would be placed on the surface of a pond, lake or other body of water. As they proceeded to randomly squiggle their way across the surface, onboard sensors would gather data such as water temperature, pH, and pollutant levels. That data could be wirelessly transmitted, or obtained from _some_ of the bots that were able to be retrieved.\nEco-friendly aquatic robot is made from fish food (motion demonstration)\nEventually, their hulls would become waterlogged enough that they would become soft, and start to sink. At that point, fish or other animals could eat them. In fact, an alternate possible use for the robots is the distribution of medicated feed in fish farms.\nEven if not eaten, all of the robot-body components would still biodegrade. Needless to say, one challenge now lies in producing sensors and other electronics that are likewise biodegradable – or even edible.\n\"The replacement of electronic waste with biodegradable materials is the subject of intensive study, but edible materials with targeted nutritional profiles and function have barely been considered, and open up a world of opportunities for human and animal health,\" says Floreano.\nA paper on the study was recently published in the journal [_Nature Communications_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59559-8).\nSource: [EPFL](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/eco-friendly-aquatic-robot-is-made-from-fish-food/)\n## Tags\n[Robotics](https://newatlas.com/robotics/)[EPFL](https://newatlas.com/tag/epfl/)[Microbots](https://newatlas.com/tag/microbots/)[Fish](https://newatlas.com/tag/fish/)[Aquaculture](https://newatlas.com/tag/aquaculture/)[Environment](https://newatlas.com/tag/environment/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Edible%20aquatic%20robots%20could%20be%20eaten%20by%20fish%20to%20eliminate%20waste&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Frobotics%2Ffish-food-bodied-robots%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/fish-food-bodied-robots/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

Researchers at Australia's RMIT University and five Chinese institutes have devised a simple and clever contraption that could solve that, by pulling potable water out of thin air.\nThe team's invention uses a newly developed composite material based on porous, lightweight balsa wood shaped into small cubes; these are installed into a cup with a domed lid, a simple cooling mechanism, and an activation system powered by the Sun.\nThe spongy material, known as WLG-15, also contains lithium chloride to improve water absorption, and iron oxide nanoparticles that help the sponge's surface layer to absorb sunlight, and turn the absorbed water into vapor. The latter also helps the water release from the material.\nThe device itself is pretty simple: when the cup's lid is open to the air, the WLG-15 material absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. When the lid is closed under sunlight, water is released into the cup. The domed lid initiates solar evaporation and facilitates the collection of the released water; a cooling plate, a heat sink block, and a cooling fan powered by a solar panel enhances condensation within the system.\nThe researchers noted that under lab conditions, their device absorbed about 0.03 fl oz (2 ml) of water per gram of WLG-15 material at 90% relative humidity, and released nearly all the water within 10 hours under the Sun. That doesn't seem like much, but when you consider that the blocks are awfully small and lightweight, it could prove to be effective in a larger configuration, or in an array of collection devices.\nFor reference, a set of nine little sponge cubes shown below – each of which weigh less than a gram – can release 0.5 fl oz (15 ml) into the cup. The researchers published the results of their work in the [_Journal of Cleaner Production_](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652625004111) in March.\nAccording to the team, this level of efficiency is higher than most other known methods like fog harvesting and radiative cooling, and cheaper thanks to the use of widely available and inexpensive balsa wood. In a bigger setup, it could potentially find use as a portable water harvesting system for emergency aid in disaster-stricken areas, with solar energy powering the cooling system.\nDr. Junfeng Hou from Zhejiang A&F University, who led the Chinese institutes' collaboration with RMIT, noted that WLG-15 also worked just fine after being stored at sub-zero temperatures for weeks, and could be reused multiple times without much of a decline in efficiency. As such, the material could even be \"deployed in real-world applications such as water collection in remote or arid regions.”\nIf you've been reading New Atlas for a bit, you've probably come across commercially available [atmospheric water generators (AWG)](https://newatlas.com/technology/aquaria-atmoshpheric-generator-drinking-water/) – electronic appliances that promise to do the same thing, with far greater speed and volumes. Why not just deploy those to disaster-stricken locations and far-flung areas where water is hard to come by?\nThey seem like an ideal solution for water-scarce regions, but the main reason is AWGs use substantial amounts of electricity to condense water vapor from air. Many water-stressed regions have unreliable or no electrical grid access, so you'd likely have trouble powering these machines. Solar-powered options exist, but add significant cost and complexity to the equation.\nPlus, AWGs work best in environments with above-60% humidity; that may not be the case in many of the locations you're thinking of. And finally, these systems can be expensive, both to purchase upfront and to maintain with specialized technical expertise and custom parts. So while they might indeed do what it says on the tin, AWGs aren't necessarily an easily applicable solution for water scarcity.\nBack to WLG-15: the researchers used AI to predict the air-to-water device's performance under a range of environmental conditions. Similar tech could also help them uncover more combinations of materials for efficient water capturing composites. The team is currently exploring ways to pilot production of this material with industry partners and test it in the field.\nOh, and incidentally, RMIT University has come up with another sponge-inspired innovation recently: [a super strong-material inspired by sea sponges](https://newatlas.com/materials/sea-sponges-inspire-strong-material-rmit/) that could find use in constructing more durable buildings.\nSource: [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2025/may/spongy-water-harvester)\n[ View gallery - 4 images ](https://newatlas.com/materials/spongy-drinkable-water-thin-air/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Materials](https://newatlas.com/materials/)[Water](https://newatlas.com/tag/water/)[Environment](https://newatlas.com/tag/environment/)[Disasters](https://newatlas.com/tag/disasters/)[Solar Powered](https://newatlas.com/tag/solar-powered/)[Survival](https://newatlas.com/tag/survival/)[RMIT University](https://newatlas.com/tag/rmit-university/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Spongy%20new%20material%20pulls%20drinkable%20water%20from%20thin%20air%20in%20emergencies&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fmaterials%2Fspongy-drinkable-water-thin-air%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/materials/spongy-drinkable-water-thin-air/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

And they don't need parachutes. We asked how... Here's the secret sauce!\n[SiFly's claims are absolutely outrageous](https://newatlas.com/drones/sifly-q12-american-drone/). Multirotor drones have been around in numbers for more than 10 years now, Chinese companies like DJI have had a decade to evolve and optimize these relatively simple airframes. How can a startup waltz into this space and find 400-1,000% gains in critical performance factors like flight endurance?\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and Chief Strategy Officer David Mazar tells me over a video call that the SiFly team has been out and about presenting that evidence to people in person, most recently at a law enforcement drone event in Ogden, Utah this week.\nIt's probably not the most exciting thing in the world to watch a drone hover for two hours on battery power – he laughs when I ask if people bring a pillow and blanket to the demos. \"I mean, you're kind of right,\" he says, \"After a while, there's only so much you can talk about ... After you get past an hour and a half and there's 40% left in the battery, people are like 'ok, let's bring it down, we believe you!'\"\nI now believe him too. Here's a two-hour hover, mercifully compressed into a 30-second time-lapse video that still manages to get boring.So what's the secret? How has SiFly found so much extra performance in multirotor airframes? It's not by using a combustion engine or hydrogen fuel cells – or indeed using alien tech, all of which readers proposed in [a lively comments section on our last piece](https://newatlas.com/drones/sifly-q12-american-drone/). The closest guess came from a reader named \"Username\" – who pointed out the larger diameter, more efficient rotors, but correctly said this wasn't enough by itself.\nMazar tells me it's a combination of factors working together, as well as some system-level thinking outside the box, that add up to SiFly's ridiculous performance gains. \nIntroducing SiFly Drones: We Fly Longer, Farther, Quieter, Stronger.\n## SiFly's recipe for disruptive multirotor performance\nThe first ingredient, as \"Username\" suggested – is SiFly's larger-diameter rotors, leading to lower disc loading, slower rotation speed and improved energy efficiency in a hover.\nBut this unlocks the second ingredient: a different class of battery. \"Most multirotors today,\" says Mazar, \"have really small blades, super high disc loading. They have to use a battery chemistry called lithium polymer (LiPo), which is made for high power, high output missions. Our lower disc loading design enables us to use the same cells you'd see in an electric vehicle – lithium-ion 21700 cells.\"\nEssentially, Mazar says these EV cells are optimized for energy storage rather than peak power output, so they're considerably better for flight endurance. \nThe third ingredient is ... well, that SiFly's drones carry much bigger batteries than the competition. Is that cheating? \"It's all about optimizing the right amount of battery to the total weight of the aircraft,\" says Mazar. \"Most multirotors today are below 35% in their battery to weight fractions. What we've optimized around is a fraction that's much higher, closer to 60% or more.\"\nFrom here, things get considerably more interesting. The SiFly Q12, you may have noticed, can hover for two hours straight, but in forward flight, endurance gets a 50% boost to three hours. There are a few things going on here. \nThe first is that the arms holding the rotors have been shaped into slim airfoils capable of generating some passive lift at cruise speed. Certainly not as much lift as a proper lift & cruise VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) design with a full sized wing enjoys, but it's not nothing. \nThe second is that the front two rotors sit lower than the rear two. \"Our front rotors are about 10 degrees lower then our rear rotors,\" says Mazar, \"reducing the amount of rotor wash that we get from air coming our of the front rotors when we're in forward flight.\"\nAnd the third is that the props are flat. \"Most multirotors,\" says Mazar, \"really use hover-optimized propellers. We've developed straight, low-drag blades, more akin to a helicopter's, which enable us to fly much more efficiently in forward flight.\"\nWhich leads to by far the most interesting innovation on this aircraft in my eyes; if the props are flat, does that mean SiFly runs variable-pitch blades like a helicopter too? Yes – but in a very different way. \n## Torque-actuated rotor pitch control\nWhere a helicopter uses a swashplate, allowing a pilot to move the center of lift around the rotor disc or quickly increase or decrease lift all at once, SiFly Founder and CEO Brian Hinman has created and [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11952110B1/en?q=\\(SiFly+Aviation+Inc\\)&oq=SiFly+Aviation+Inc) a system that mechanically varies blade pitch in response to motor torque.\nSo the rotor blades sit nearly flat at zero or low torque, but as more torque is applied by the motor, a \"torsionally flexible shaft\" begins to twist in the motor housing, and this is connected to a mechanism that tilts the blades until they reach a hard stop at a pre-determined maximum pitch. As torque decreases, the flexible shaft elastically moves back to its untwisted state and the blade pitch drops again. \nSo the harder you run the motors, the more the blades pitch up – perfect for takeoff and hover carrying large payloads. And when you're applying relatively low torque to keep the blades turning in forward flight, they pitch down to enable a lower-drag cruise state. \nThis also gives SiFly an interesting way to rapidly increase or decrease lift without having to wait for propeller RPM to catch up to a control input. \"Our torque-actuated rotor pitch control essentially enables us to scale up the quadcopter architecture without facing the inertia and responsiveness problems of RPM-controlled thrust systems,\" says Mazar. \"The rest of the industry, I think, believes that explicit collective control is required to make large rotorcraft – which carries a burden of increased cost and weight and these types of things. We think it's a much more elegant solution and approach that we're taking.\"\n\"You put all these things together,\" Mazar tells me, \"and you're talking about efficiency upon efficiency upon efficiency.\"\n## Passive autorotation for soft landings\nOh, and this torque-actuated blade pitch system comes with a free set of steak knives, too, in the form of a safety system that lets SiFly's drones autorotate safely down to the ground in a power failure scenario. So where other large drones might require the added weight of ballistic parachute systems to float down safely, these don't.\nHinman describes how this works in a [Medium post](https://brian-is-flyin.medium.com/autorotation-for-electric-rotorcraft-the-recipe-8270afb049b9) and another [two](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11634235B1/en?q=\\(SiFly+Aviation+Inc\\)&oq=SiFly+Aviation+Inc) [patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230312120A1/en?q=\\(SiFly+Aviation+Inc\\)&oq=SiFly+Aviation+Inc), but it can be summarized like this: in a thrust system power failure – assuming the control system is still powered – the drone begins to fall, and the lack of torque through the motors flattens out the blade pitch. As descent speed increases, the airflow up through the blades spins them up to high RPM, as with a helicopter.\nThe spinning blades represent a form of stored energy, and this means there's still a way to apply torque to the motors – just in reverse. The control system is able to brake the rotors by running the motors backwards as generators, and the resulting torque is enough to effect a change in blade pitch. \nUsing this electrical braking system gives SiFly a degree of control over an unpowered descent from cruise speed. Allowing the aircraft to pitch forward slows the rotor speed as it glides downward, and pitching it backward trades some airspeed for rotor speed, forcing a lot of air through the blades and rapidly spinning them up.\nJust before a helicopter lands in autorotation, the pilot needs to perform a \"flare\" in which all blades are pitched up to extract the maximum possible lift from the energy stored in that big, free-spinning top rotor and create the cushion of air required for a soft touchdown.\nObviously, SiFly's quadcopter rotors aren't big or heavy enough to store nearly as much energy as a helicopter rotor. But there is a big battery on board. If that's still functional, Hinman says it's possible to regenerative-brake enough energy back into the battery for a powered flare and landing.\nAnd if the battery's totally gone, well ... \"The touch down phase of autorotation involves the unloading of the inertial energy within the four rotors,\" writes Hinman. \"Collective is gradually increased across all four rotors, with some degree of differential adjustment for attitude control, and the quad-copter comes to a cushioned landing on the ground as the rotors gradually lose speed.\"\nJust how cushioned remains to be seen, and the answer will likely be very different depending on cruise speed and altitude at the point of failure. It's unlikely to work as well as helicopter autorotation, but it might top the performance of a ballistic 'chute in some circumstances, and at the end of the day these are uncrewed vehicles; it might just need to slow the fall down enough to let deformable crash structures take the final hit and minimize damage ... Not that this will be a great comfort to anyone standing underneath it when it hits. \n## So how are they building this in the USA at prices competitive with Chinese rivals?\nWell, firstly, what kind of rivals are we talking about? \"We've had people try to compare us to a DJI Air – that's not what we're talking about here,\" says Mazar. \"We're talking about their large enterprise-grade system. Models in the M300, M350 type category. And they have a tremendous product.\"\nSo how can SiFly keep American manufacturing costs competitive with Chinese competitors that churn out drones by the million and leverage hyper-local supply chains so effectively that they've completely dominated the drone market from day dot?\nWell, not all the components will be made on US soil, for starters. \"There are some elements from a component standpoint where China is basically the only place you can get stuff,\" says Mazar. \"Things like blades, there are only a few places to get blades that will be competitive ... But there are supply chains opening up in Malaysia, Vietnam, and some other areas where we have partners that are very capable at developing subcomponent systems ... We're able to bring them back and make it very efficiently.\"\nCertainly, if SiFly wants to press its biggest domestic advantage – the fact that it's producing American-made drones – the company won't be sourcing flight control computers or software out of China that could get it ruled out of consideration for defense contracts and the like.\nRealistically, the biggest cost advantage SiFly brings to the table is probably the switch from LiPo to EV-grade batteries, simply due to the scale at which EV cells are now manufactured. \"We leverage what electric vehicles are doing on the cell side,\" says Mazar, \"and we have our partners who are packing them, which makes for a much more cost-effective battery solution.\"\nAnd much of the rest, Mazar says, comes from the fact that the company won't be using off-the-shelf components, but instead using its own designs. \"Designing for manufacturing at all levels,\" he says, \"making things simple and easy to produce is one piece of it.\" This sounds a little backwards to me – surely it's hard to beat off-the-shelf prices.\nWe shall see – but not just yet. \"We have defined a price for our pre-order program,\" Mazar tells me, \"and we will be releasing that publicly in the very near future.\"\nCertainly, this company is bringing some very innovative thinking to the table. It's rare to see a disruptor come into an industry like this, which looked pretty mature and settled, and blow competitors' performance so far out of the water – and I hope you've found the process of figuring out how as fascinating as I have! \nSource: [SiFly](https://sifly.co/index.html)\n[ View gallery - 7 images ](https://newatlas.com/drones/how-sifly-reinvented-drones/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Drones](https://newatlas.com/drones/)[drones](https://newatlas.com/tag/drones/)[Quadcopter](https://newatlas.com/tag/quadrocopter/)[Delivery drone](https://newatlas.com/tag/delivery-drone/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=American-made%20Sifly%20drone%20has%203x%20more%20flight%20time%20than%20DJI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fdrones%2Fhow-sifly-reinvented-drones%2F)\n\n\n[ 8 comments ](https://newatlas.com/drones/how-sifly-reinvented-drones/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/loz-blain/)\n[Loz Blain](https://newatlas.com/author/loz-blain/)\nLoz leads the New Atlas team as Editorial Director, after nearly two decades as one of our most versatile writers.

Though certainly basic, it also doesn't break the bank.\nThe Nook is based on a standard 20-ft (6-m) shipping container, which is the same size used to create Madeiguincho's [Cargo](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/cargo-shipping-container-madeiguincho/) model. The container has been painted a uniform black and has had windows and doors cut into it, plus it has cedar accenting. It's also insulated with closed cell foam insulation, to try and mitigate the poor thermal performance of living in what's essentially a big metal box.\nThe interior decor of this home is quite simple, with almost everything situated in one open space. It's also all on one floor – which is definitely sensible in such a small footprint.\nThe glazed front door opens onto the kitchen area. This is compact but has a sink, cabinetry, a fridge/freezer, a microwave, as well as space for some more appliances. The Nook's bathroom is accessed by a sliding door and contains a sink, shower, and a flushing toilet.\nOther than a wall-mounted mini-split air-conditioner, the remainder of this tiny house is unfurnished, so the owner will need to install their own seating and/or bed. A sofa bed or daybed configuration like Escape's [Vista](https://newatlas.com/escape-vista-go-tiny-house/45629/) would probably be a wise option, rather than trying to cram a separate sofa and bed in there.\nThe Nook is currently up for sale for US$39,900 and is ready to ship throughout the US – or even worldwide if the buyer is willing to take on the additional risk and cost of a port delivery. Custom Container Living does also offer optional off-grid upgrades, including solar panels, though obviously this would increase the cost significantly.\nSource: [Custom Container Living](https://www.customcontainerliving.com/ready-to-ship/)\n[ View gallery - 8 images ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/nook-custom-container-living/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Tiny Houses](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/)[Building and Construction](https://newatlas.com/tag/building+and+construction/)[Tiny Footprint](https://newatlas.com/tag/tiny-footprint/)[Micro-House](https://newatlas.com/tag/micro-housing/)[shipping containers](https://newatlas.com/tag/shipping-containers/)[House](https://newatlas.com/danish-mirror-house/21118/)[Home](https://newatlas.com/tag/home/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Shipping%20container%20tiny%20house%20delivers%20downsized%20living%20for%20under%20%2440k&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Ftiny-houses%2Fnook-custom-container-living%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/nook-custom-container-living/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\n[Adam Williams](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

Nature doesn’t always follow the rules we expect, and sometimes it veers straight into the realm of the absurd. Take, for example, a curious little snail species you’ve probably never heard of. It has a truly baffling biological quirk: it lays its eggs through an opening in its neck.\nJust let that sink in for a moment.\nYeah, no, I'm as puzzled as you are. The neck?! We’re used to eggs coming out the back end, maybe a cloaca if we’re talking birds or reptiles, but the neck? That’s a whole new frontier in weird.\nHere, see for yourself:\nPowelliphanta augusta snail laying an egg\nThis rare creature, known as [_Powelliphanta augusta_](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Powelliphanta_augusta), was discovered less than 30 years ago and is found only in New Zealand. There likely aren't a lot of them because, unlike garden snails, they reproduce in tiny numbers and take forever to get around to it.\nSpeaking of reproducing, these snails are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female genitalia. That's handy because, as New Zealand Department of Conservation's (DOC) senior science advisor Kath Walker explains, \"as carnivores which have to live at relatively low density, being able to occasionally self-fertilize must help with survival of the species.”\nThese snails also mate with others, by extending their penis out of a genital pore that lies just below their head, into another snail's opening. In fact, both snails do this with each other simultaneously, so they both exchange sperm that can be stored to fertilize and create eggs later on.\nHaving genitals and laying eggs from just below the head makes sense if you're a snail: the rest of their soft bodies are safely ensconced in a shell, and they don't need to expose themselves to the elements and other dangers to mate or give birth.\nThis clip is practically the first time anyone's ever seen a _Powelliphanta augusta_ lay an egg. DOC ranger Lisa Flanagan, who has been looking after these snails for the last 12 years and filmed the phenomenon, spotted it while weighing one of the snails, and had never witnessed it before. As it turns out, these snails only begin to lay eggs once they sexually mature at around eight years of age – and even then, they only lay about five eggs annually.\n_Powelliphanta augusta_ is believed to have only been found on the Mount Augustus ridgeline in New Zealand's town of Westport, and said ridgeline was removed by mining operations. Environmental nonprofit TerraNature Trust noted that when the DOC came upon them, it was estimated that [there were only 800-1,000 of them alive](https://www.terranature.org/snailTranslocation.htm).\nThe agency says it has established new populations of the snail in the wild, rescuing it from the brink of extinction after its habitat was destroyed.\nIf you're into wonders of the animal world like this, you might also enjoy learning [why killer whales smash boats](https://newatlas.com/biology/orcas-killer-whales-boats/), how we're [using AI to speak the language of dolphins](https://newatlas.com/biology/build-ai-translator-dolphins-dolphingemma/), and [the ways of real-life zombie parasites](https://newatlas.com/biology/last-of-us-season-2-real-life-zombie-parasites/) in the wild.\nSource: [Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/sex-life-of-rare-snail-revealed/)\n## Tags\n[Biology](https://newatlas.com/biology/)[Animals](https://newatlas.com/tag/animals/)[Animal science](https://newatlas.com/tag/animal-science/)[New Zealand](https://newatlas.com/tag/new-zealand/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Watch%3A%20Rare%20snail%20lays%20an%20egg%20from%20its%20neck&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fbiology%2Frare-snail-lays-egg-neck-video-new-zealand%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/biology/rare-snail-lays-egg-neck-video-new-zealand/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

(2025) [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\nUsing an existing steroid-free topical foam daily significantly improved the signs and symptoms of psoriasis on the scalp _and_ the body, according to a recent clinical trial. It could be a game-changer for people with the condition in both places.\nTreating [psoriasis](https://newatlas.com/medical/t-cells-autoimmune-skin-disorders-selectively-eliminated/), a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red patches that can be itchy and painful, can be challenging if it appears on both the body and the scalp. Many topical treatments for the body aren’t suitable for use on the scalp because of the presence of hair, necessitating separate prescriptions.\nHowever, a recently published Phase 3 clinical trial investigated the use of roflumilast foam, sold as [Zoryve](https://www.arcutis.com/products/zoryve-foam/), as a single treatment for psoriasis on both the body and scalp, and produced some promising results.\nRoflumilast reduces inflammation by targeting an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which is involved in controlling the body’s inflammatory process. Importantly, it is steroid-free, which means it avoids side effects associated with steroids and is meant for long-term use. A foam version of the drug is indicated for the treatment of [seborrheic dermatitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710), a common skin condition causing scaly patches, inflamed skin and stubborn dandruff. \nLike with seborrheic dermatitis, [inflammation](https://newatlas.com/skin-learns-inflammation-heals-faster/51850/) is a problem in psoriasis. The condition causes the immune system to go into overdrive, resulting in the characteristic plaques that result from the buildup of skin cells. In addition to dampening this immune response, roflumilast inhibits sensory nerve cells, reducing itching. The trial investigators wanted to see if the drug was an effective psoriasis treatment because of its immune-dampening and itch-reducing effects.\nA total of 432 patients (56.3% women) aged 12 and older with psoriasis on the scalp and body were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used roflumilast foam 0.3% once a day for eight weeks, while the other used an identical foam without the active ingredient (“the vehicle”). Trial investigators measured Scalp-Investigator Global Assessment (S-IGA) and Body-IGA (B-IGA) scores. Both are five-point scales used to assess the severity of skin conditions like psoriasis in clinical trials. They range from a score of zero (clear, no signs of the condition) to four (severe). The primary endpoints were “success” in S-IGA and B-IGA scores, defined as achieving a score of zero or one (almost clear) plus at least a two-grade improvement from baseline at week eight. The investigators also assessed changes in skin itch intensity.\nThey found that, compared to those who used the vehicle, significantly more patients in the roflumilast group achieved the primary endpoints at week eight: 66.4% achieved S-IGA success compared to 27.8%; 45.5% achieved B-IGA success compared to 20.1%. Additionally, more patients in the roflumilast group achieved an S-IGA of clear (40.0% vs 9.1%) and a B-IGA of clear (27.8% vs 11.0%) at week eight. Improvements in itching severity at weeks two, four, and eight were significantly higher for roflumilast than for the vehicle group. Indeed, improvements in scalp itch, particularly, were seen in the roflumilast group as early as 24 hours after the first treatment.\nLow rates of adverse events were observed. The most common adverse event that occurred during the course of treatment with roflumilast, treatment-_emergent_ rather than treatment-_related_ , was headache (4.6%), followed by diarrhea (3.2%) and nausea (2.1%).\n“Use of roflumilast foam was associated with significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of psoriasis of the scalp and body, consistent with outcomes previously observed with roflumilast cream, 0.3%, in patients with psoriasis,” said the researchers.\nAlthough it’s a minor limitation, the length of the trial means that the results are limited to an eight-week timeframe. Nonetheless, the significance of the results means that patients with psoriasis of the scalp and body might want to consult their treating medical practitioner to discuss an [off-label prescription](https://www.zoryve.com/seb-derm) for roflumilast foam.\nThe study was published in the journal [_JAMA Dermatology_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2833460?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamadermatol.2025.1136).\n## Tags\n[Illnesses and conditions](https://newatlas.com/disease/)[psoriasis](https://newatlas.com/tag/psoriasis/)[Treatment](https://newatlas.com/tag/treatment/)[clinical trials](https://newatlas.com/tag/clinical-trials/)[Skin](https://newatlas.com/tag/skin/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Single%20steroid-free%20psoriasis%20foam%20treats%20both%20scalp%20and%20body&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fdisease%2Froflumilast-foam-plaque-psoriasis-body-scalp%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/disease/roflumilast-foam-plaque-psoriasis-body-scalp/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\n[Paul McClure](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\nPaul brings extensive knowledge and real-world experience to New Atlas.

This article was originally published in January 2025, but has been re-edited and updated with new information current as of May, 2025. Enjoy!_\nThe company said earlier this month that it's on track to deliver the first lot of orders by the end of this spring (Northern Hemisphere); if you're one of those early birds, you'll be prompted to finalize your purchase a couple of months ahead of the estimated delivery date.\nThe California-based upstart is looking to shake up the space with modern features and design. It revealed pricing for the Flow travel trailer back in January: you're looking at US$109,500 for the base model, with a fully optioned unit taking the price up to $175,000.\nPre-orders opened in the US around the start of the year. At that time, the company had made a bunch of improvements and changes to the model we saw [back in October 2023](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/pebble-semi-autonomous-electric-rv/).\nTo recap, the 25-ft-long (7.6-m) all-electric trailer packs dual motors for propulsion assistance, reducing the effort required by your vehicle to tow it. It also gets the nifty ability to automatically hitch onto your vehicle on its own. And once you're at your destination, the luxury trailer can maneuver itself into a convenient camping spot. A 45-kWh battery powers the whole thing, and can top off your EV as well.\nPebble Flow | The Next-Generation of All-Electric RVing\nAs with the early prototype, the Flow features thoughtfully appointed interiors and a sleek design that Pebble says is designed to reduce drag. There are also a range of niceties, including room to sleep four people, a bed that retracts to reveal a workspace, and a functional kitchen.\nThe production-ready model gets several updates on the inside:\n  * Redesigned cabinets that flip up rather than down for easy access, along with more storage areas\n  * Side and rear windows that flip open\n  * A bigger door for taller folks to enter and exit easily\n  * A large skylight window above the dinette\n\n\nThe exterior has been refined as well:\n  * The body has been reworked for better aerodynamics, and the tail lamps are now integrated\n  * Ground clearance has been increased\n  * A hitch receiver now lets you fit accessories on the back, like a bike rack\n  * Four cameras, one on each side, provide \"full coverage for easier maneuvering and safety on the road\"\n\n\nPebble has also re-engineered the drivetrain to improve the Flow's movement while parking and hitching up to your SUV or truck. It's worth noting that this dual-motor system isn't available on the Standard model that comes in at $109,500. That base model also ships sometime in 2026. If you want your Flow to position itself with an active tow assist system and receive it sooner, you'll need to upgrade to the Magic Pack, which starts at $135,500.\nYou can also opt for a bunch of accessories:\n  * Rooftop solar ($4,000)\n  * All-terrain levelers ($2,250)\n  * Motorized awning ($1,750)\n  * Exterior smart privacy glass that turns opaque on demand ($4,000)\n\n\nThe $175,000 Founders Edition includes all of these, along with premium bedding, a portable projector, and membership to an exclusive club for owners of this variant. You'll get access to events and lifetime roadside assistance, too.\nWhile there have been previous attempts to bake towing assistance into trailers, including [this one](https://newatlas.com/dethleffs-electric-coco-caravan/56056/), [this one](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/airstream-e-stream-self-driving-glamper-trailer/), and [this one](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/ozx-self-powered-camper-trailer/) over the years, it appears that Pebble may be the first company to deliver on that promise.\nLightship, another Californian trailer outfit, is [also working on a similar product](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/lightship-self-propelled-electric-camping-trailer/), the AE.1. However, it's aiming to start shipping units this Northern Hemisphere winter (later than Pebble) and its towing-assist-enabled model starts at a higher price than the motor-equipped Flow, at $151,000.\nIf you've got that kind of scratch lying around, this is going to be a good year to answer the call of the great outdoors.\n[Pre-orders for the Pebble Flow are open](https://pebblelife.com/build), with a refundable deposit of $500 on the company's site.\n_A version of this article was originally published on January 19, 2025._\nSource: [Pebble](https://pebblelife.com/post/Pebble-Begins-Production) via [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250106838084/en/Pebble-Unveils-the-Production-Intent-Pebble-Flow-The-Next-Generation-of-All-Electric-RVing)\n[ View gallery - 11 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/pebble-flow-electric-rv-trailer-production-spring-2025/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[RV](https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/)[Trailer](https://newatlas.com/tag/trailer/)[Electric Vehicles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+vehicle/)[Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/)[2025 Updates](https://newatlas.com/tag/2025-updates/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=World%27s%20first%20self-hitching%20trailer%20goes%20into%20production&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fpebble-flow-electric-rv-trailer-production-spring-2025%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/pebble-flow-electric-rv-trailer-production-spring-2025/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

Retro-looking flashy contraptions like the Ford Volante concept car. If you were to ask Dezső Molnár what his vision of a flying car looked like, he'd simply show you the one he's building now.\nIt's been nearly a decade since [New Atlas checked in with](https://newatlas.com/search/?q=dezso+molnar) Dezső's then-concept Streetwing flying car. Much has changed in the overall appearance, but the fundamentals have stayed the same: build a vehicle that can drive on public roads and fly in the most fun and economic way possible for people who _actually_ want to go places.\nA quick background on the Los Angeles, California-based inventor will tell you he's probably unlike anyone you've ever met before. Having personally met him several times in various places around the US, I'd liken him to the [Hunter S. Thompson](https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/hunter-s-thompson) of rocket science and inventions – sans the schedule-1 shenanigans, of course. \nHis roles have included pilot of a C-141B in the US Air Force, X-Prize judge, crew chief for the Spirit of America land speed record car (nearly breaking the sound barrier on land), [flying motorcycle](https://newatlas.com/dezso-molnar-g2-gt-flying-motorcycle/34399/) pilot, musician, inventor of the Mixman DM-2 ... Honestly, I could go on. An entire article could be written just listing his various cool jobs, remarkable accomplishments, and sheer \"Holy moly, he did [what](https://newatlas.com/dezso-molnar-interview-flying-cars/42243/)?!\" moments.\nOh yeah, and one more thing: he belongs to the [Explorers Club](https://www.explorers.org/). You know, the club whose members include Buzz Aldrin, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Jane Goodall, James Cameron, and even the real-life inspiration for Indiana Jones, [Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Chapman_Andrews). \n**\"The Porsche 911 of flying cars\"**\nDezső envisions this to be the do-all machine for everything; either a single or two-seater configuration with an electric or fuel-powered drivetrain for day trips, long trips, or even racing. His motivation for creating it in the first place was his desire to travel the Pan-American Highway, which runs from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, roughly 20,000 miles (~32,000 km) down to Ushuaia, Argentina – but with one major hurdle right in the middle: the undrivable [Darién Gap](https://www.britannica.com/place/Darien-Gap). It's a 60-mile (100-km) stretch of thick jungle and swampland with zero roads in northern Colombia. Ferries to ship your vehicles around the gap are the typical means of going around this no-man's land ... but what if you could simply convert your car into a plane and just fly over it?\nMolnár took design cues for the Streetwing from his personal Quickie 2 Tri-Q200 plane. He says, \"I don't think 'Quickie' is a good name, so I call it xWing,\" because hey, \"if you own it, you name it.\" Molnár designed a plug-mold for the Streetwing with the help of [Craig Calfee](https://newatlas.com/calfee-design-bamboo-bikes/14378/) – another world-renowned name, pioneering the very first carbon fiber bicycle ridden in the Tour de France – using similar dimensions and wing/wheel pattern as the xWing. That's pretty much where the likeness ends.\nAs it sits in its current configuration, the Streetwing is a street-legal, 17-ft-long (5.2-meter), \"electric motorcycle\" (per vehicle registration requirements, as it has two front wheels and one rear) with a 52-kW [Zero electric motorcycle](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/big-hole-zero-electric-motorcycle/) motor powering the rear propeller and an 8-kW hub motor powering the rear wheel. Molnár happened to have the electric motor lying around, so he stuffed it in there for the time being to get it driving. A bonus to the design is having a fixed rear drive-wheel that eliminates ground loops. \nIt's looking as though the final drivetrain configuration will be from Lightning's [Strike R electric motorcycle](https://newatlas.com/lightning-strike-electric-sportsbike/59072/) – Richard Hatfield's more affordable version of the [Lightning LS218](https://newatlas.com/lightning-ls218-review-ls-218/36470/) – aptly named for its land speed record of 218 mph (350 km/h). The Strike R motor is nearly as powerful as the ultra-fast LS218, at 180 hp (134 kW) and 120 lb-ft (163 Nm) of torque. It ought to be _sufficient_. It's certainly more than the Tri-Q plane has, power-wise. Molnár says that both flight and road use can be powered by the single electric motor with ease.\nOnce fitted with the Lightning Strike R motor, it's expected to quietly zip from 0-100 mph (161 km/h) in around 10 seconds using rear wheel power before the prop takes over for flight. \nThe Streetwing will sport two sets of lightweight 7-foot-long (2.1-m) wings in the same configuration as the Tri-Q200: a pair of forward canards and a pair of rear main wings. I say \"will\" because as of the time of writing, the wings are purely for configuration, demonstration, and storage purposes. Molnár is still in the process of determining how to safely and effectively attach them to the fuselage for flight. And he has other ingenious plans for the wings, besides just covering them with 75 sq ft (7 sq m) of solar panels (about 1,700 watts worth).\nIn an alternate \"sail\" configuration, for instance, the wings could be oriented vertically to catch as much wind as possible. This would allow them to propel the Streetwing across desolate roads (think [Hwy 85](https://www.dangerousroads.org/asia/arabian-peninsula/6556-highway-85.html) in Saudi Arabia: 510 miles (822 km) of nearly ruler-straight, totally flat road across the desert), frozen lakes (Like Canada's \"Winter Road\" that spans roughly 373 miles (600 km) from Tibbitt to Contwoyto), or really anywhere that is sufficient for a good sail-powered land vehicle. In \"sail mode,\" the rear wheel could act as a generator, capturing and storing power in the battery banks for future drive or flight.\nAnother creative and smart application, which Molnár admits is one of his prouder features of the Streetwing design, is to lash the plane to the ground with the nose pointing into the wind (as one normally would when parking their planes at an airport) and use the wings mounted in lieu of the prop as a [wind turbine](https://newatlas.com/energy/world-record-offshore-wind-turbine-dongfang-26-mw/) to charge the batteries while the craft is not in use, like during an overnight stop. With just a 15-mph (24-km/h) breeze, the current 6,000-watt generator could put a substantial charge back into the batteries. The wings are light enough that a single person can do the job.\nWhen asked about the choice of an electric powertrain, Dezső explained that \"small airports are shutting down because of noise. Straight pipes on traditional planes shoot downwards and you're not allowed to change the design of certified planes ... The Streetwing is much quieter ... The motor can shut down entirely on landing and even reverse prop to slow. It makes more runways accessible.\"\nIt's not just the noise; Most private planes were designed and developed in the 1950s, when Avgas (100-octane leaded aviation fuel) was 20-25 cents per gallon (3.8 liters) versus the $6-8 per gallon it is today. Jet-A was even cheaper in the 50s at roughly 10 cents per gallon versus the now, ranging from $5-7 per gallon.\nWith several means of the Streetwing generating its own electricity _and_ the ability to simply plug it in for charging if there's power available, it could bring the cost of flying down from about $100 an hour to closer to $1 an hour. With Level 3 charging, the 400v system could charge from 20 to 80% in 10 minutes. Add in the fact you can simply drive away from the airport, and your ability to find better charging infrastructure becomes significantly higher than what a small airport might offer.\nDezső says the Streetwing weighs in at about 560 lb (254 kg) without a pilot or batteries, leaving headroom of about 540 lb (245 kg) for pilot, batteries, and cargo. Pretty close in specs with the Tri-Q200. He expects to achieve at least a 200-mile (322-km) driving range or at least 100 miles (160 km) of flight before needing charging. While airborne, the Streetwing will use traditional flight controls: the trusty stick and rudder setup. On the ground, he says a standard steering wheel will do the trick. \nSo after nearly a decade, why hasn't Dezső finished building the Streetwing yet? \nWell, aside from a few key contributors who have helped with the conceptual design, testing, and validation, the project has been entirely self-funded. Getting an airframe from concept to a 5,000-ft (1,500-m) elevation is nothing short of _difficult_ , to say the least ... and prohibitively expensive. \nWhile the chassis is absolutely roadworthy, there are still a few hurdles to get it airworthy – like a flight-worthy airframe. We're talking carbon fiber fuselage, suspension, all the flight equipment ... and wings that attach. Dezső is open to sponsorship proposals *_hint-hint_ * if there's someone out there looking to be part of the Streetwing flying car project. \nAs soon as that minor detail is taken care of, the Streetwing will taxi along and get up to speed on its road wheels. Once up to speed, the push-prop will take over thrust-duty for flight and the rest is history!\nThis isn't Dezső's first time building a unique flying/driving machine. In 2005, he built the Molnár GT ... a \"gyrocycle\" that's one part motorcycle and one part gyroplane. Pictures of it sit proudly next to the original [Wright Flyer](https://newatlas.com/bremont-wright-flyer-watch/33110/) in the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum in Washington, DC.\nDezső has no inclination to add creature comforts like an air conditioner or cupholders. \"I'm positioning for exploration ... Let's just _fly_ ,\" he says. And honestly, you won't get any arguments from me.\nMolnar Streetwing New Atlas edit\nDezső will be [giving a talk](https://www.adventurersclub.org/events/flying-cars-a-case-for-exploration-and-racing-adventures-with-dezso-molnar/) at the Adventurer's Club in Los Angeles on June 12th, speaking on exploration and his flying car racing league! \nSource: [Dezső Molnár](https://www.dezsomolnar.com/)\n[ View gallery - 12 images ](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/dezso-molnar-streetwing-flying-car/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Aircraft](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/)[Flying Cars](https://newatlas.com/tag/flying-car/)[Flying Machine](https://newatlas.com/tag/flying-machine/)[Test Flights](https://newatlas.com/tag/test-flight/)[Inventors](https://newatlas.com/tag/inventor/)[Features](https://newatlas.com/tag/features/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=The%20Streetwing%3A%20a%20flying%20car%20for%20true%20adventure%20seekers&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Faircraft%2Fdezso-molnar-streetwing-flying-car%2F)\n\n\n[ 8 comments ](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/dezso-molnar-streetwing-flying-car/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/joe-salas/)\n[Joe Salas](https://newatlas.com/author/joe-salas/)\nA well-established motorcycle action photographer with high-octane gasoline in his veins, Joe also takes a keen interest in a broad range of technologies, gadgets, outdoor living and adventure topics. \n## Most Viewed\n  * [ ](https://newatlas.com/automotive/subaru-most-reliable/)\n[Automotive](https://newatlas.com/automotive/)\n###  [Toyota and Lexus no longer most reliable carmakers, says Consumer Reports](https://newatlas.com/automotive/subaru-most-reliable/)\n  * [ ](https://newatlas.com/energy/france-tokamak-cea-west-fusion-reactor-record-plasma-duration/)\n[Energy](https://newatlas.com/energy/)\n###  [France runs fusion reactor for record 22 minutes](https://newatlas.com/energy/france-tokamak-cea-west-fusion-reactor-record-plasma-duration/)\n  * [ ](https://newatlas.com/automotive/kawasaki-corleo-robot-horse/)\n[Automotive](https://newatlas.com/automotive/)\n###  [Kawasaki unveils a hydrogen-powered, ride-on robot horse ](https://newatlas.com/automotive/kawasaki-corleo-robot-horse/)\n\n\nLoad More",

The Lift & Slide Cart was designed to address that problem, as it does indeed allow users to both lift and slide up to 440 lb (200 kg) of cargo.\nCurrently the subject of a Kickstarter campaign, the Lift & Slide was first envisioned by Portland, Oregon-based entrepreneur Yervant Wei when he was just 13 years old. He and his father Robert, who is an international business expert, proceeded to build a series of prototypes.\nWhen in rolling-along-the-ground mode, the present version of the Lift & Slide looks much like any other cargo cart. It has a 47.2 x 28.3-inch (1,199 x 719-mm) carbon steel load platform, a handle that can be folded down for transit and storage, and four rubber-tired wheels – the rear wheels swivel, and are equipped with parking brakes.\nOnce you get the cart to the back of your truck, you activate a battery-powered hydraulic scissor-lift mechanism located on its underside. That mech raises the cart (wheels and all) to the height of your truck's folded-down tailgate. You then manually stop the lift.\nAt this point, with a regular lift cart, you would have to lean in and physically lift each cargo item off of the cart and into the truck bed. With the Lift & Slide, though, you just slide the cargo-laden cart into the bed along a set of rails that extend horizontally from the truck-side of the lift.\nIn a final step, you withdraw the lift mechanism, which pulls itself _up_ into its truck-level aluminum frame. The whole folded-up mech is then slid forward – along the same set of rails that were used before – so that it's once again on the underside of the cart.\nThe loading process is demonstrated in the following video. Unloading, needless to say, is just the same process in reverse.\nLoading Process\nThe Lift & Slide should reportedly work with just about any make and model of pickup truck, as long as its bed isn't higher than 50 inches (1,270 mm). It also ought to be compatible with most SUVs and vans, if their cargo bay is at least 48 inches long by 40 inches tall (1,219 by 1,016 mm).\nAccording to the Weis, one charge of the cart's 48V lithium-polymer battery should be good for about 140 lift cycles at the maximum load of 440 lb (200 kg). The Lift & Slide itself is claimed to tip the scales at about 173 lb (78.5 kg).\nAssuming everything goes according to plan, a pledge of US$929 will get you a Lift & Slide Cart of your own. The planned retail price is $1,399. Unfortunately the design _has_ already been copied, although the unlicensed clones reportedly don't sport all of the original's features.\nSources: [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pairontools/lift-and-slide-cart-an-effortless-way-to-load-cargo/), [Pairon Tools](https://pairontools.com/)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/good-thinking/lift-and-slide-cart/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Good Thinking](https://newatlas.com/good-thinking/)[Cart](https://newatlas.com/tag/cart/)[Cargo](https://newatlas.com/tag/cargo/)[Lifting](https://newatlas.com/tag/lifting/)[Kickstarter](https://newatlas.com/tag/kickstarter/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Cunning%20cargo%20cart%20packs%20its%20own%20powered%20lifting%20and%20sliding%20mechanism&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fgood-thinking%2Flift-and-slide-cart%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/good-thinking/lift-and-slide-cart/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

The XP and its subsequent generations have since become the ride of choice for more than 400,000 bikers across the US.\n\"Because this model is so important to us and our riding community, we were determined to hold the line on price,\" said Conlow, company CEO. \"While other ebike companies continue to raise prices and launch new products at higher price points, we know riders are going to appreciate Lectric going against the grain and making huge improvements for the same entry price we set more than four years ago.\"\nThat US$999 price tag is for the base model, which comes in either step-over or step-through frame variants, its pedal-assist is powered up to 28 mph (45 km/h) by a 500-W motor that peaks at 1,092 watts, and its UL-certified integrated battery is good for up to 50 miles (80 km) of per-charge range.\nFor riders who want more of everything, the XP4 family now has a more powerful option. The Stealth M24 rear-hub motor here has a continuous output rating of 750 watts but peaks at 1,310 and can produce 85 Nm (62.6 lb.ft) of torque – compared to 55 Nm for the base model.\nFive riding modes are offered, and the ebike can be tweaked to roll as a Class 1 or 2 (with a 20 mph top assist speed) or as a Class 3 (up to 28 mph/45 km/h). Either way, as the name suggests, the motor should run whisper quiet, while an in-house torque sensor promises a smoother, more responsive experience. A below-the-bar throttle trigger is also available for pedal-free riding.\nLectric has cooked in an 840-Wh battery for up to 85 miles (136.8 km) per charge – an optional 5-Amp charger is available for fast-charging. And users no longer need to insert a key to power the battery on or off.\nA new custom 3.5-inch color display with drop-down menus shows at-a-glance ride metrics and ebike status, features a detachable mount, is backlit and includes USB-C port for topping up mobile gadgetry while out and about.\nThe redesigned 6000-series aluminum frame can fold down to 37 x 17 x 29 in (94 x 43 x 73.6 cm) for stowing away in the trunk or under the office desk. The collapsed ebike should also be a better fit for public transport, and weighs in at 68.5 lb (31 kg), including the long-range battery.\nThe rear rack has been designed to heft up to 150 lb (68 kg) of cargo, and can be upgraded with a LevelUp rack that has mounts for child seats or the optional Buddy seat (which includes a handlebar and foot pegs). The XP4 has a maximum payload capacity of 330 lb (~150 kg).\nRounding out the key specs, an 8-speed Shimano Altus derailleur provides an extra cog compared to the previous model, a suspension fork absorbs some of the bumps along the way, and 20-inch rims wear 3-inch mixed-terrain tires with custom tread and slime (for puncture resistance). Stopping power is supplied by hydraulic brakes rocking 180-mm rotors.\nA telescoping seat post and adjustable stem help the folding utility ebike accommodate riders from 4.8 to 6.25 ft in height (1.47 - 1.9 m). Daylight visibility and after-dark illumination comes courtesy of an integrated 90-lumen headlight and braking tail-light with turn signaling. Fenders with a flared tale keep debris and splashes at bay, and there's a heavy duty kickstand for parking stability.\nThe XP4 base model can be had for $999, while the XP4 750 starts at $1,299. Both are up for pre-order now, with shipping expected to start from May 26.

Designer [Backcountry Tiny Homes](https://newatlas.com/backcountry-tiny-homes-acorn/60231/) also managed to fit in a light-filled layout that boasts some nice home comforts, including a bathtub, a standing loft, and even a dedicated reading space.\nThe Library is based on a triple-axle trailer and has a length of 28 ft (8.5 m). Its exterior is finished in green metal siding, with wooden detailing.\nThe home is accessed through a paned door into its kitchen, which has generous glazing and a pleasant wood-focused decor. The other thing you immediately notice is all the books: they are mounted on walls, lined on shelves and safely stowed all over the home.\nThe kitchen features a farmhouse-style sink, a fridge/freezer, a microwave, and an oven with four-burner propane-powered stove. There's also a lot of cabinetry available.\nNext to the kitchen is the living room. This is simply furnished with just a chair and a desk area that presumably serves as a home office, though there is space in there for more seating too. Elsewhere on the ground floor is the bathroom. This is pretty luxurious for a tiny house and has a soaking tub and shower, a vanity sink, and a composting toilet.\nThe Library has two lofts. One is located above the living room and is accessed by a removable ladder. This is used as a quiet reading area and is again lined with lots of books. The other is reached by a storage-integrated staircase and serves as the bedroom.\nThough the bedroom itself is a typical loft model, it does have a lowered floor area allowing the owner to stand upright and make it easier to get in and out of bed. There's also yet more book storage in there.\nWe've no word on the price of this one.\nSource: [Backcountry Tiny Homes](https://www.backcountrytinyhomes.com/custom-homes)\n[ View gallery - 10 images ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/library-backcountry-tiny-homes/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Tiny Houses](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/)[Building and Construction](https://newatlas.com/tag/building+and+construction/)[Tiny Footprint](https://newatlas.com/tag/tiny-footprint/)[House](https://newatlas.com/danish-mirror-house/21118/)[Home](https://newatlas.com/tag/home/)[Micro-House](https://newatlas.com/tag/micro-housing/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Book-filled%20tiny%20house%20for%20two%20focuses%20on%20reading%20and%20relaxation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Ftiny-houses%2Flibrary-backcountry-tiny-homes%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/library-backcountry-tiny-homes/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\n[Adam Williams](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

The short clip features a humanoid robot malfunctioning, flailing its appendages wildly, and getting almost too close for comfort to two humans working on it.\nThe robot is believed to be a [Unitree H1](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-h1-humanoid-bipedal-robot/), a US$90,000 general-purpose humanoid that we've previously seen [breaking out dance moves alongside humans](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-bipedal-robot-dance-h1/), [taking the stairs](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-h1-humanoid-robot-walking-speed-record/), and [pulling off a backflip](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-h1-backflip/). It stands 5.9 ft tall (180 cm) and weighs 104 lb (47 kg).\nThat makes it the size of a full-grown person, but what's scary is that it can muster up a substantial joint torque of 365 lb.ft (360 Nm) for lifting heavy objects. With its arms and legs swinging at high speed, the robot could seriously injure people nearby.\nBut is this really a terrifying scene from _Terminator_ in real life? Maybe not. There's a bit of context and a technical explanation floating around, but I haven't yet heard back from Unitree officially confirming any of it. Still, it's worth thinking about, so here's what you're possibly looking at in the clip which seems to have .\n> Footage claimed to show a Unitree H1 (Full-Size Universal Humanoid Robot) going berserk, nearly injuring two workers, after a coding error last week at a testing facility in China. [pic.twitter.com/lBcw4tPEpb](https://t.co/lBcw4tPEpb)\n> — OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) \nA YouTube channel called 'Chris Wabs' [posited that this clip is from a public event where Unitree was set to demonstrate the H1's capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dVp8QABysU). However, you'll notice that the robot was tethered by its head to a stand when it was powered on; this could have affected its balance and sense of orientation.\nAs such, it's possible the robot may have perceived itself to be falling, and responded with dramatic corrective movements. That's what might have looked like violent flailing.\nIt's also possible the humans working nearby ran a program on the robot that didn't execute as expected.\nThe video is certainly unsettling, but that may have a lot to do with the lack of context in which we saw this incident occur. And hey, if a robot can get disoriented just by being made to feel like it's off balance, maybe we don't have to worry about metal-and-AI overlords taking over the planet right away.\nA previous clip from February, the authenticity of which I haven't been able to verify, appeared to show a Unitree humanoid at a festival seeming to attack or intimidate attendees, before being restrained by security staff. This one is scary too, but it also raises a question: how do you deescalate a dangerous encounter with a robot?\n> Chinese AI robot goes rogue and attacks a person before getting shut down! 🇨🇳 🤖Just a little preview of our bright future..

The projector is also said to offer 700,000:1 contrast, support for HDR10 and HLG content, and four-corner keystone correction. The unit supports portrait imagery too, for viewing content from the likes of TikTok, as well as a 360-degree mode for placement flexibility.\nThis is not a smart projector, so you'll need to consider plugging in a streaming stick if you want to catch up with favorite shows or the latest movies from services like Netflix, Disney+ and Prime. Ethernet LAN is included though, for hooking up to a home router. There are two HDMI ports around back, one of which features audio return, plus a USB Type-A power port for cabled connectivity.\nConsole or PC gamers will appreciate the 4.3-millisecond input lag when 1080p at 240 Hz is dialed in, which bumps up to 8 ms for 120-Hz Full HD and 16.9 ms at 4K60. The GT4000UHD sports a single 15-W speaker for handling soundtracks in-house, or you can cable the audio out to an external home theater system. \nIt's available now for US$4,499.

The team has found that silencing MTCH2 protein expression in muscle tissue, which was first demonstrated in mice, also made human cells essentially \"immune\" to storing fat and supercharged metabolism naturally.\nMTCH2, which has been cutely dubbed \"Mitch,\" even ramped up muscle function and performance – described by the scientists as increased athletic ability – delivering that elusive outcome of diet-free, gym-free fat loss and improved health and fitness.\nIt's the latest discovery in an emerging area of obesity research focused on the expression of proteins. Earlier this year, a study detailed how [silencing another protein](https://newatlas.com/diet-nutrition/tricking-metabolism-weight-loss/) – the liver's plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein – could also switch fuel sources to be more efficient at burning fat sources and speed up metabolism. In 2018, another study showed how [switching off a different gene](https://newatlas.com/rcan1-gene-weight-loss/57514/) would have a similar outcome.\nAnd in January, scientists found that tweaking the BCL6 protein, which plays a key role in muscle structure, could also [burn fat while improving tissue structure](https://newatlas.com/diet-nutrition/protein-fat-muscle-glp1/) without a single day of weight training.\nIn the latest study, the team found that shutting down Mitch had the same effect on human cells as previously seen in mice. Without this protein, fats and carbohydrates were burned at a higher rate, and it appeared to block new fat cells from developing.\nWhat's perhaps most interesting about Mitch's origin story is that it plays a key role in mitochondrial fusion – which is a process that guides the union of two previously distinct organelles within a cell. We all know from biology class that mitochondria are the \"powerhouse\" of the cell, crucial in converting fuel to energy. So in blocking Mitch, cells are deprived of efficient energy production. But rather than prove harmful, it simply forced the cells to seek out other energy supplies to accommodate for the deficit. And, unlike the go-to source of carbohydrates and proteins, the go-to alternative energy was deposited fat. \n\"After deleting Mitch, we examined, every few hours, the effect that it had on more than 100 substances taking part in metabolism in human cells,\" said lead researcher Sabita Chourasia. \"We saw an increase in cellular respiration, the process in which the cell produces energy from nutrients, such as carbohydrates and fats, using oxygen. This explains the increase in muscular endurance in previous experiments using mice.\"\nWhile it sounds a little counter-intuitive, the Mitch-free cells didn't starve without mitochondrial fusion – they just developed an appetite for fat. Carbs are generally the preferred source of fuel, as they're easily accessible and quick to process, fat is more energy dense, so a better target for energy-deprived cells.\n\"We discovered that deleting Mitch led to a major drop in fats in membranes,\" said Weizmann professor Atan Gross. \"At the same time, we saw an increase in fatty substances used to produce energy, and we realized that the fat was being broken down from the membrane to be used as fuel. In other words, we showed that Mitch determines the fate of fat in human cells.\"\nWhat's more, the scientists found that Mitch – which has been shown to be elevated in obese women – also plays a key role in determining what kind of fat deposits develop as progenitor cells become mature fat cells.\n\"When we deleted Mitch from the progenitor cells, we discovered that the environment created in these cells was not conducive to the synthesis of new fats,\" Gross said. \"Reducing the ability to synthesize membranes prevents the cells from growing, developing and reaching the point where differentiation is possible.\"\nEssentially, without Mitch, the muscles develop a kind of \"obesity immunity,\" which is made even stronger thanks to the switch in metabolic function that sees cells seeking out fat to burn for energy.\n\"The process of fat accumulation requires a large amount of available energy, but in cells without Mitch, there is a shortage of energy,\" said Gross. \"In addition, the expression of genes necessary for differentiation is suppressed, and there is a shortage of the substances vital for this process to occur. As a result, differentiation of new fat cells is reduced, along with fat accumulation.\"\nWith a better understanding of the role Mitch plays in blocking fat accumulation, the researchers are now working on developing a new small molecule therapeutic that could silence Mitch. If successful, this could have a profound impact on weight loss and obesity treatment. \nThe research was published in [_The EMBO Journal_](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44318-024-00335-7).\nSource: [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/life-sciences/slimming-mitch)\n## Tags\n[Obesity](https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/)[Weizmann Institute](https://newatlas.com/tag/weizmann-institute/)[Obesity](https://newatlas.com/tag/obesity/)[Fat cells](https://newatlas.com/tag/fat-cells/)[Weight Loss](https://newatlas.com/tag/weight-loss/)[Muscle](https://newatlas.com/tag/muscle/)[metabolism](https://newatlas.com/tag/metabolism/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=%22Obesity%20immunity%22%20drug%20a%20step%20closer%20thanks%20to%20silencing%20Mitch&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fdisease%2Fobesity%2Fobesity-immunity-mitch%2F)\n\n\n[ 6 comments ](https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/obesity-immunity-mitch/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\n[Bronwyn Thompson](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\nBronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

It can be set up indoors or outdoors, and could be particularly useful to people with limited transportation options.\nThe idea is that instead of having to arrange an actual face-to-face visit with a doctor in their office, users can engage in a remote real-time audio/video appointment with them via the Cube. Every unit is staffed by trained technicians or nurses to assist patients and operate equipment.\nAlong with the HD video communications system, each Cube incorporates a variety of tools that can be used to check vital signs (a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, thermometer, etc), plus there is the possibility of outfitting the H3 with equipment for performing procedures such as CT scans, colposcopies, abdominal ultrasounds and electrocardiograms, plus the drawing and analysis of blood samples.\nThe patient's privacy is maintained throughout the appointment, and a UVC ultraviolet-light-based sterilization system – along with easy-clean surfaces – facilitates sanitization between uses.\nUniDoc _now_ informs us that it has shipped its first three orders to commercial clients. \nThe first of these orders consists of three H3's (with plans for 15) to be be deployed in conflict-affected regions of Ukraine and the Gaza Strip by the Italian aid group Aiutamoli a Vivere Foundation. The second order is a single H3 for use at the Territorial Health Center in Italy's Municipality of Aliano, and the third is a single unit going to the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Ukraine.\nSource: [UniDoc Health](https://unidoctor.com/)\n _A version of this article was originally published in 2022._\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/imaging-diagnostics/h3-health-cube-ships-first-units/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Imaging & Diagnostics](https://newatlas.com/imaging-diagnostics/)[Telepresence](https://newatlas.com/tag/telepresence/)[Diagnostic devices](https://newatlas.com/tag/diagnostic-devices/)[2025 Updates](https://newatlas.com/tag/2025-updates/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=H3%20Health%20Cube%20%22self-contained%20connected%20clinic%22%20ships%20to%20first%20clients&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fimaging-diagnostics%2Fh3-health-cube-ships-first-units%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/imaging-diagnostics/h3-health-cube-ships-first-units/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

It could mean delaying surgical intervention or preventing it altogether.\nThe intervertebral discs between the spinal vertebrae comprise a gel-like core, the nucleus pulposus (NP), encased by a tough, fibrous outer ring. The NP’s high water content allows it to act like a shock absorber and pressure distributor in the spine. With age or injury, the NP degenerates, leading to chronic “discogenic” back pain.\n[VIVEX Biologics](https://vivex.com/), a US-based biotechnology company that is focused on regenerative medicine, recently published the results of a clinical trial of [VIA Disc NP](https://vivex.com/by-brand/via-disc-np/), a non-surgical, minimally invasive treatment for supplementing degenerated disc tissue to treat discogenic pain. The results are very promising.\n“The ability to effectively manage chronic lumbar discogenic pain in this patient group for a one-year duration with a single intradiscal NP procedure translated to correspondingly durable improvements in back function,” the researchers said.\nThe commercially available VIA Disc NP consists of human NP obtained from the donated disc tissue of deceased persons. The tissue is then morselized (chopped into small fragments or morsels) and sterilized. When it’s required, the donor NP is reconstituted with 2 ml of sterile saline and injected into the degenerated intervertebral disc (or discs). The procedure is done while the patient is awake but sedated. A local anesthetic is given at the injection site. Patients can return home the same day and resume normal activities the day after.\nTwenty-eight participants (43% female) with an average age of 44 were enrolled in the VIA Disc NP clinical study. To be eligible, they had to have had lumbar discogenic pain for six or more months that was unresponsive to “conservative management,” including oral analgesics, structured physical therapy or a physical therapist-prescribed exercise program, chiropractic, and [epidural steroid injections](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/injections-back-pain/) or nerve blocks. Moderate degeneration of up to two lumbar intervertebral discs was confirmed by an MRI scan.\nAdditional inclusion criteria for the study included having a baseline [back pain severity score](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/low-back-pain-acute-chronic-cochrane-review-treatment/) of six or more on an 11-point (zero to 10) numeric rating scale (NRS) and a back function score of between 40 and 80 points on the [Oswestry Disability Index](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Oswestry_Disability_Index) (ODI). The ODI provides a subjective percentage score of a person’s degree of function in performing activities of daily living. It’s considered one of the most accepted tools for assessing low back pain. An ODI score of 41% to 60% indicates a “severe disability” and a score of 61% to 80% indicates a person is “crippled.”\nVia Disc NP Procedure\nAs it was a single-arm study, all participants received a single, intradiscal dose of 100 mg of VIA Disc NP to the affected disc(s) (some participants had two discs treated). There was a compulsory follow-up for all patients at four weeks post-procedure, with further follow-up at three, six, and 12 months. Of the 28 participants enrolled, 22 stayed for the full 12-month follow-up period. The primary objective of the study was to gauge the magnitude of improvement in back pain severity and back function at that time.\nParticipants reported a statistically significant decrease in NRS scores from 7.1 points at baseline to 3.8 points at 12 months. Almost 60% of them reported a 12-month back pain severity score of three or less. A corresponding clinical improvement in back function was also seen, with ODI scores falling from 53 at baseline to 24 at 12 months. Before the treatment, 82% of participants reported ODI scores that placed them in the “severe” or “crippled” category. By 12 months, that number had dropped to 18%. Whether participants had one or two discs injected did not affect the outcome.\n“These findings confirm and extend our previous six-month followup report of this study group,” said the researchers, referring to their pilot study findings published in _Pain Physician_ and available [here](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=NzkyMw%3D%3D&journal=166) as a PDF. “We noted no further degradation in treatment efficacy between six and 12 months.”\nMild-to-moderate adverse events (low back pain, back muscle spasms, and thigh pain) were reported that could’ve been related to the NP product or the procedure. All of them were resolved. There was one serious adverse event – injection site inflammation – definitely related to the procedure that also subsequently resolved. No secondary surgical interventions were needed.\nThe study’s small sample size, one serious adverse event, the lack of a control or placebo group, and the loss of participants before the 12-month mark are limitations that make the findings less generalizable. However, future studies can address these limitations, and the researchers said their findings are important for the future of back pain treatment.\n“Lengthening the duration of treatment efficacy has important implications for the potential of intradiscal NP treatment in delaying more invasive surgical options such as disc arthroplasty or instrumented spine fusion,” they said. “Therefore, it remains essential that this study group continue to be followed longitudinally to assess the extent of treatment efficacy.”\nThe study was published in the journal [_BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders_](https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-025-08701-0#Sec8).\n## Tags\n[Chronic Pain](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain)[Low back pain](https://newatlas.com/tag/low-back-pain/)[Disc](https://newatlas.com/tag/disc/)[Treatment](https://newatlas.com/tag/treatment/)[clinical trials](https://newatlas.com/tag/clinical-trials/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Non-surgical%20treatment%20eases%20chronic%20back%20pain%20%26%20restores%20function&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fchronic-pain%2Fnucleus-pulposus-allograft-back-pain-clinical-trial%2F)\n\n\n[ 8 comments ](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/nucleus-pulposus-allograft-back-pain-clinical-trial/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\n[Paul McClure](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\nPaul brings extensive knowledge and real-world experience to New Atlas.

It highlights how simple dietary changes can optimize health and improve quality of life.\nLast year, _New Atlas_ reported on a study led by researchers from [Queen’s University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/) (QUB), in North Ireland, and [Edith Cowan University](https://www.ecu.edu.au/) (ECU), in Perth, Australia, that found that a so-called “flavodiet” – a diet high in flavonoids, compounds found in things like berries, apples, and black tea – lowered the risk of developing [dementia](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/red-wine-berries-tea-dementia/).\nNow, ECU and QUB have teamed up again, this time with US and Danish researchers, to investigate the relationship between consuming a flavonoid-rich diet and indicators of unhealthy aging, such as frailty, reduced physical function and poor mental health.\n“The goal of medical research is not just to help people live longer but to ensure they stay healthy for as long as possible,” said [Nicola Bondonno, PhD](https://www.ecu.edu.au/schools/medical-and-health-sciences/our-staff/profiles/post-doctoral-research-fellows/dr-nicola-bondonno), Adjunct Lecturer at ECU’s [School of Medical and Health Sciences](https://www.ecu.edu.au/schools/medical-and-health-sciences/overview) and the study’s lead author. “Our research shows that people who consume more flavonoids tend to age better.”\n[Flavonoids](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-are-flavonoids) are a group of plant chemicals – phytochemicals – responsible for the vibrant color of many fruits, vegetables and flowers. [Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7211351/#:~:text=Flavonoid%2Drich%20foods%2C%20based%20on,shown%20in%20Figures%201%2C%20A%2DE.) has shown that they have a range of health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. While tea and wine are the primary sources of flavonoids in Eastern and Western societies, many foods are rich in them, including berries, citrus fruits, apples, onions, and cocoa.\nFor the present study, the researchers used data from two longitudinal studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), which followed 62,743 female nurses from 1990 (considered baseline) to 2014, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), which followed 23,687 male health professionals from 2006 (baseline) to 2018. Participants in both studies filled out questionnaires relating to lifestyle and medical history at baseline and every two years thereafter, providing up-to-date lifestyle data and information on any newly developed diseases. Participants were only included in analyses when they reached age 60 or older. Those under 60 at baseline only entered the study once they’d reached this milestone.\nThey found that in the NHS group, the highest intakes of tea, red wine, blueberries, apples, and oranges or orange juice were associated with 11% to 21% lower risk of developing frailty compared with the lowest intakes. The highest intakes of red wine, blueberries, apples, strawberries, and oranges/orange juice were associated with 4% to 14% lower risk of physical impairment compared with the lowest intakes. Similarly, the highest intakes of apples, [strawberries](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/flavonoids-kaempferol-food-allergy/), oranges/orange juice, and grapefruit/grapefruit juice were associated with a 10% to 15% lower risk of poor mental health, compared with the lowest intakes.\nIn the HPFS group, the highest intakes of tea and blueberries and moderate average intakes of red wine were associated with a 14%, 15%, and 29% reduction, respectively, in the risk of poor mental health. Otherwise, for men, there were no associations between intakes of any of the flavonoid-rich foods and drinks and either frailty or reduced physical function.\n“Flavonoids are well known for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, supporting blood vessel health, and even helping to maintain skeletal muscle mass – all of which are important for preventing frailty and maintaining physical function and mental health as we age,” said the study’s corresponding author, [Professor Aedín Cassidy](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/aedin-cassidy), from QUB’s [Institute for Global Food Security](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/organisations/institute-for-global-food-security). “We found that participants who increased their intake of flavonoid-rich food by three servings a day, had a 6% to 11% lower risk across all three of the aging outcomes in females, and a 15% lower risk of poor mental health in males.”\nThe researchers say the findings highlight how simple changes to what we eat can benefit our health, particularly for older people.\n“Overall, these findings underscore the potential for simple dietary modifications to impact overall quality of life and contribute to the optimization of healthy aging,” said co-author [Professor Eric Rimm](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/eric-b-rimm/) from the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://hsph.harvard.edu/).\nThe study was published in [_The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000784?via%3Dihub).\nSource: [ECU](https://www.ecu.edu.au/newsroom/articles/research/black-tea-and-berries-could-contribute-to-healthier-ageing)\n## Tags\n[Wellness & Healthy Living](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/)[Aging](https://newatlas.com/tag/aging/)[Healthy aging](https://newatlas.com/tag/healthy-aging/)[Flavonoids](https://newatlas.com/tag/flavonoids/)[Diet](https://newatlas.com/tag/diet/)[Edith Cowan University](https://newatlas.com/tag/edith-cowan-university/)[Queens University Belfast](https://newatlas.com/tag/queens-university-belfast/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=%27Flavodiet%27%20%E2%80%93%20a%20simple%20way%20to%20reduce%20signs%20of%20unhealthy%20aging&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fhealth-wellbeing%2Fflavonoid-rich-diet-healthy-aging%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/flavonoid-rich-diet-healthy-aging/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\n[Paul McClure](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\nPaul brings extensive knowledge and real-world experience to New Atlas.

Ebikes still felt like a pretty new thing at the time, and this Aussie monster threw all questions of street legality out the window to show what these machines could be without regulatory shackles holding them back.\nIn 2025, ebikes are well and truly embedded in society. Those who try one instantly see why they've become so popular. They're a staple for commuters and delivery folk, and a doorway to an active lifestyle for people that might not otherwise jump on a bike. \nAnd others have picked up on the trail Stealth blazed back in the day – the Chinese-made Sur-Ron Light Bee and Talaria Sting, for example, both sit somewhere in between a dirt bike and an ebike, way lighter than most of the former and dozens of times more powerful than the latter. They've built up a cult following thanks to hilarious performance at crazy-low prices.\nNeither of them has pedals, though – but this one does. Stealth is back in 2025 with a considerably juiced-up version of the 4.8-kilowatt (6.4-hp) machine we once called \"[a mountain bike on steroids... And amphetamines](https://newatlas.com/stealth-h52-electric-bike-review/40663/).\"\nThe B-52R's hub motor makes up to 8 kW (11 hp), and torque is nearly doubled as well, leaping from 120 to 230 Nm (88.5 to 170 lb-ft). It's more efficient too, losing less energy to noise. \"The new model is much quieter than its predecessors,\" Stealth Bikes Founder John Karambalis tells _New Atlas_. \"With operating sound emissions at around 40 dB.\" That's about as loud as a fridge, for those who don't speak sound pressure levels. \nIt's a bit faster than the average fridge, though. Some owners, says Karambalis, are \"recording top speeds above 100 km/h (62 mph).\" The additional power and torque are messing with the handling a bit – but in the best possible way. \"It makes steering a little difficult,\" he tells us, \"because the front wheel rarely touches the ground.\"\nAs with the original B-52, Stealth is offering a lifetime warranty on the B-52R's heavy-duty monocoque frame and the 6-speed electromechanical gearshift you can use with the pedals – both made in Australia. \"We're confident nobody will be able to break [the chassis],\" says Karambalis, throwing down a steaming gauntlet to nutbags worldwide. \nWe were impressed with the original B-52's 203-mm e-MTB brakes, but Stealth has made a substantial upgrade here, moving to 250-mm motorcycle rotors. The wheels grow too, from 24-inchers with MTB tires to 27.5-inchers running a dirtbike knobby on the rear, a change which Karambalis says has \"almost completely eliminated flat tires.\" Enduro-style suspension offers 180 mm (7.1 in) of travel at the front, 200 mm (7.9 in) at the back.\nThe battery capacity rises as well – but not super high. The pack holds 2.5 kWh, which Stealth says is enough for a 60-km (37-mile) jaunt between three-hour charges. You probably wouldn't want to go much bigger on the pack, either – the bike weighs in at 70 kg (154 lb). Still significantly lighter than a regular dirt bike, and Stealth tells us it's very easy to handle due to a low center of mass, but the weight is starting to get up there!\nWe wouldn't try to get away with riding this thing on the street – Stealth might be the company name, but there's nothing that could camouflage this beefy machine's true intentions or massive hub motor. That's an enormous pity, because I can think of few things that would make kids in back seats on long road trips happier than looking out the window and watching some maniac overtake the family car, pedaling like mad. \nThis bike is not cheap. At US$8,890, the B-52R is competing against some pretty impressive gasoline dirt bikes for your dollar, and more than twice as expensive as a Sur-Ron. But its near-silent performance, rugged build, next-level power and torque – not to mention the option to actually pedal the thing if you really want to – will set it apart for lunatics that can pay to play. \nElectrification opens all sorts of doors to genre-busting vehicles, and Stealth has been choosing the path less trodden for more than a decade now. It's always great to see a wild bike get wilder!\nSource: [Stealth Bikes](https://www.stealthelectricbikes.com/product-page/stealth-b-52r?currency=USD)\n[ View gallery - 5 images ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/stealth-b52r-high-power-ebike/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Bicycles](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/)[Electric Motorcycles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+motorcycle/)[Electric Vehicles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+vehicle/)[ebikes](https://newatlas.com/tag/ebikes/)[Bicycle](https://newatlas.com/tag/bicycle/)[Crazy](https://newatlas.com/tag/crazy/)[Stealth Bikes](https://newatlas.com/tag/stealth-bikes/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Wildly%20overpowered%20ebike%20lets%20you%20pedal%20along%20at%20highway%20speeds&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fbicycles%2Fstealth-b52r-high-power-ebike%2F)\n\n\n[ 11 comments ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/stealth-b52r-high-power-ebike/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/loz-blain/)\n[Loz Blain](https://newatlas.com/author/loz-blain/)\nLoz leads the New Atlas team as Editorial Director, after nearly two decades as one of our most versatile writers.

It follows that model up rather quickly with a full-blown two-sleeper, the X-Dome 2. \nInstead of merely making a tent that's as light as possible at the cost of comfort, Durston understands that backpackers and mountaineers will be living in their tent night after night and might very well be holed up for days on end, waiting out dangerous weather and conditions. So it works to make a comfortable tent that offers unwavering weather protection, then applies strategic use of materials and geometry to keep it as lightweight as possible. It's a strategy it calls _weight efficiency_ , not simply weight savings. \nIn the case of the X-Dome 2, that efficient weight tallies to 2.75 lb (1.2 kg, fly, inner tent and poles) for a proper two-person tent. Whether you think of that as 22 ounces (612 g) per person or as a 44-oz total, it's a low amount of weight for a freestanding tent that promises 3+ season weather protection, packs enough elbow room to sleep comfortably, and boasts a variety of thoughtful features to make life at backcountry base camp smoother and more convenient. \nThe X-Dome 2 picks up where the 1+ leaves off by widening out the tapered trapezoidal floor of the latter to the point that the 52-in (132-cm) floor width stretches the entire length of the tent, providing plenty of room for two sleeping pads side by side with space in between. That's nearly a full-size bed's worth of width to go along with an extra-long 88 inches (224 cm) of length that leaves extra space for storing clothes and gear, assuming one or both campers isn't among the tallest people alive. \nDurston uses its signature X-Mid diagonal floor, which in this case is a proper parallelogram. As the upper diagrams above show, this shaping works naturally with the fly to efficiently create two spacious vestibules, ensuring that both campers have space to store their backpack and boots. The two individual doors make entry/exit fast and convenient for both campers. \nDurston gives the X-Dome steep walls to increase overall volume and adds a peak crossbeam to spread the 43-in (109-cm) maximum interior height over a larger portion of the roof, not simply a single central apex. A full double-wall construction pairing an independent tub-floored mesh inner tent with a waterproof silicone-impregnated polyester (sil-polyester) rainfly promotes superior anti-condensation ventilation, even when the tent is fully closed up and guyed out. \nUsers can pitch the tent rainfly first to protect the interior from active rain, inner tent first in clear weather, or with both layers pre-connected for the fastest setup time. Carbon fiber poles save weight and deliver better strength-per-ounce than aluminum, according to Durston, and wider tube diameters at critical structural areas ensure the utmost stormproof performance. \nFor even more strength, such as when facing down the potential of particularly high winds or snow loads, the X-Dome 2 features trekking pole connection points near the ends of the rooftop cross pole, essentially connecting the crossbeam and two trekking poles into a full side-to-side support arch for boosted structural integrity. \nThe X-Dome 2's sil-polyester construction keeps weight low and dries quickly while avoiding the sag and sticking that can hamper sil-nylon, Durston explains. The fly extends low to the ground to provide more robust protection from drafts and splashing rain, and a pair of roof vents keeps air moving when all zipped and staked. \nOther X-Dome 2 features include fast-action magnetic fly door tie-backs, four interior storage pockets, four interior loops for clotheslines and other hanging needs, and fully waterproofed seams. The first production run of the new two-man tent launched last week. \nAt launch, the X-Dome 2 can be ordered with a \"regular\" pole set and aforementioned \"regular\" mesh body for US$469 or with regular poles and a solid body for $489. Designed for colder weather, the solid body does away with much of the mesh in favor of solid poly fabric. It adds 3.5 oz (100 g) to the total weight of the tent. \nThe regular pole set, meanwhile, offers the lowest weight and packs down to a length of 18 inches (46 cm). A planned \"short\" pole set packs to 13 inches (33 cm) long for bikepackers and others who want a smaller packed form but adds on an extra 1.3 oz (35 g) due to the added folding hardware. \nDurston also plans to add Dyneema variants to its X-Dome series for even lower weight totals (and well higher price tags). \nFor those interested in hearing it straight from the horse's mouth, Durston founder Dan Durston does a full X-Dome 2 walkthrough in the video below.\nDurston X-Dome 2 | Ultralight Freestanding Tent\nSource: [Durston Gear](https://durstongear.com/products/x-dome-2-ultralight-tent?variant=53592259854627)\n-\n[ View gallery - 16 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/durston-x-dome-two-person-backpack-tent/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[Tent](https://newatlas.com/tag/tent/)[Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/)[Backpacking](https://newatlas.com/tag/backpacking/)[Lightweight](https://newatlas.com/tag/lightweight/)[durston-gear](https://newatlas.com/tag/durston-gear/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Stormproof%20ultralight%20tent%20targets%20immaculate%20design%20to%20last%20stitch&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fdurston-x-dome-two-person-backpack-tent%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/durston-x-dome-two-person-backpack-tent/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/c-c-weiss/)\n[C.C.

They replace the outgoing R 1250 RS and the R 1250 RT, respectively. And as you’d expect, there’s plenty of farkles on the touring bikes.\nBoth models get significant upgrades from their predecessors, including a new chassis and aerodynamics. But the biggest update comes in the form of the new boxer engine that was seen on the newly-launched R1300 R a few weeks ago.\nThe R 1300 RS and R 1300 RT are specifically designed sports tourers and luxury touring bikes, respectively, that add to the growing lineup of BMW’s 1,300cc motorcycles. That lineup already consisted of the aforementioned R 1300 R and the adventure-focused R 1300 GS and R 1300 GS Adventure models. Here’s all that’s new on these models.\nWe'll start with the most important bit first – the engine. Similar to the R1300 R, the new BMW R1300 tourers sport the same two-cylinder boxer engine that has a displacement of 1,300cc.\nIt generates 143.5 horsepower at 7,750 RPM (9 hp more than its predecessor) and a maximum torque of 109.8 lb-ft (149 Nm) at 6,500 RPM. The bore and stroke ratio, which was previously fixed at 102.5 x 76mm, has been changed to 106.5 x 73mm, which is responsible for the power boost.\nA 6-speed gearbox that uses a shaft drive to transfer power is employed. [BMW](https://newatlas.com/tag/bmw-motorrad/) states a top speed of 149.1 mph (240 km/h) for the R 1300 RS, while the R 1300 RT tops at 124.2 mph (200 km/h). Not bad for a tourer, eh?\nThe engine is held in a completely redesigned chassis acting as a stressed member, which is made out of a sheet steel mainframe and an aluminum lattice subframe. That’s a big step away from the tubular frame on the 1250. There's also a hollow-spoke approach taken to the 17-inch aluminum cast wheels, which helps reduce weight by a whole 3 lb (1.4 kg).\nSpeaking of which, the R 1300 RS tips the scales at 540 lb (245 kg), while the RT weighs 619.4 lb (281 kg) – not light by any means. But if you’re practically carrying a house, it ought to be hefty!\nRain, Road, and Eco are the standard riding modes on offer. And for those seeking a sportier touch, Dynamic and Dynamic Pro modes are further included in the extra Riding Modes Pro package\nAdditionally, MSR (engine drag torque control) also comes as stock, which, in the event of excessive engine braking, temporarily opens the throttle valves to aid in preserving stability during rapid downshifting. The Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), which offers completely automated clutch action and gear shifting for a smoother riding experience, is also available ex-works.\nOn the farkles side of things, there’s a 6.5-inch colour TFT with BMW Motorrad Multi-Controller for the R 1300 RS, which increases to a mammoth 10.25-inch TFT on the RT. A new twin-chamber headlamp with independent dual-LED modules forms the all-LED lighting setup. The Adaptive Turning Light option further ups the ante for illumination.\nThe RT also gets a pair of 7.1-gal (27-liter) side cases in addition to optional Vario boxes that can be expanded further to 8.7 gal (33 liters) on either side. There are additional top boxes that hold 10.3 and 14.2 gal (39 and 54 liters respectively) – the latter comes with a heated pillion back pad.\nYou can also choose an optional radar system whose front sensor is positioned above the primary LED headlamp, beneath the huge windscreen. Assist features include Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC), Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (LCW), and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).\nThere’s so much more to these motos that I can’t even get to the depths of the hardware that’s on them, without sounding like a nerd. An honorable mention – both the tourers get the famed Telelever Evo setup that’s also found on the R1300 GS. Wowza!\nColor-wise, the BMW R 1300 RS will be available in Triple Black for all models, Racing Blue metallic for the base model, Lightwhite Uni for the Performance variation, and Brooklyn Grey metallic for the high-end Option 719 Cuyamaca edition. As for the R 1300 RT, you get four trims too: Basic, Impulse, Triple Black, and Option 719 Camargue.\nPrices start at a whopping US$17,690 for the sportier R 1300 RS and $23,190 for the frilled-up R 1300 RT.

That's where the CargoMate comes in, as it pops on and off of your handlebars in a claimed 30 seconds.\nCurrently the subject of a Kickstarter campaign, the CargoMate is made by German cycling gear company The Outsider Team. Among other things, the firm previously brought us the [Flectr Lubri Disc](https://newatlas.com/flectr-lubri-disc-chain-lube/59181/) chain lubrication device.\nAt the heart of the CargoMate is a tubular stainless steel frame, a waterproof fabric loading platform, and a bungee-cord loop that runs through six eyelets in the frame. The whole shebang reportedly tips the scales at 670 g (1.5 lb) and can support load weights of up to 5 kg (11 lb). It's said to be compatible with almost all upright bicycles.\nTo install the rack, you start by placing two rubberized hooks – located at the top of its frame – over the handlebars. Next you run a webbing strap between the two ends of the hooks, in such a fashion that it passes _beneath_ the handlebar stem. After that, it's just a matter of running another strap around the steerer, and cinching it tight.\nThe process, which reportedly takes no more than half a minute, is demonstrated in the following video.\nCargoMate – A Smarter Bike Rack\nBackers can choose between polished silver and semi-matte black frame finishes, along with six fabric colors and nine bungee cord colors. Lashing straps and carabiners are available as optional extras.\nAssuming the CargoMate reaches production, a pledge of €69 (about US$78) will get you one – the planned retail price is €99 ($112).\nIn fairness, we should point out that the device is _quite_ similar to the successfully crowdfunded [Jack rack](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/jack-bike-rack/).

A recent study shows that retraining your brain to deescalate negative emotions and enhance positive ones could be an effective therapy for persistent and long-lasting pain.\nThe study, conducted by researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Sydney and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), involved 89 participants across Australia aged 26-77 years-old, who suffered from chronic pain. They took part in a nine-week program to develop mindfulness, emotional regulation skills, and distress tolerance to help weather an emotional crisis.\nThe researchers learned that chronic pain isn't just sensory, it's also connected to patients' emotional state. It was even reported to increase anxiety and depression, and emotional dysregulation was a regular feature of the condition among the people they spoke with. What's more, many people noted their pain was significantly worse in times of stress. It could also lead to a vicious circle, with stress bringing on more pain, and causing more stress.\nSome of that is commonly known. More recently, however, [a 2021 study showed a measurable change in the brain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34242465/) caused by chronic pain; more specifically, in the decrease of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the prefrontal cortex. That's the part of the brain that controls emotions, and GABA is the brain chemical that helps calm your circuits. As such, the researchers hypothesized that if we can relax the brain, we can avoid emotional distress and reduce chronic pain.\nTheir program, dubbed Pain and Emotion Therapy, takes the form of eight group sessions on Zoom with the participants, a supporting handbook with more info and worksheets, and a mobile app to guide patients through tasks in each of the skills required to develop better emotional regulation.\nThe research team, led by UNSW's Professor Sylvia Gustin and Dr. Nell Norman-Nott, carried out a randomized controlled trial with half the participants undergoing this therapy, and the other half only following their usual pain treatments. When they were assessed after nine weeks and after six months, those who got the brain retraining therapy showed a significant improvement in emotion dysregulation, compared to the control group, and also benefited from improved sleep quality.\nThose who received Pain and Emotion Therapy also reported lower pain intensity. There was a substantial difference in this factor between the two groups at the six-month mark. One patient reported it was easy to implement this therapy and found it relevant to her everyday life, in comparison to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Another reported being able to reduce her morphine intake for pain reduction, and an increase in energy levels.\nWhile the results [published in the medical journal _JAMA Network Open_](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.6908) are encouraging, they come from a small trial. The researchers intend to expand their work, with the next phase of trials beginning in 2026: [adults in Australia can sign up via this link](https://www.neurorecoveryresearch.com/pain-emotion-therapy) to participate in the completely online nine-week study next year, so the team can gather more data.\nIf it proves to be effective for larger numbers of people, this could be a major breakthrough for [the 20-30% of the global population who suffer for months to decades from chronic pain](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7215a1.htm). Gustin and Norman-Nott also emphasize that their program can be delivered remotely and online, which means it could reach people in far-flung and rural areas without the need for special spaces or equipment – and potentially improve more lives.\nSources: UNSW, NeuRA via [Scimex](https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/news-briefing-retraining-the-brain-for-chronic-pain)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/brain-retraining-therapy-chronic-pain-unsw/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Chronic Pain](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain)[Chronic pain](https://newatlas.com/tag/chronic-pain/)[Emotions](https://newatlas.com/tag/emotions/)[University of New South Wales](https://newatlas.com/tag/university-of-new-south-wales/)[Neuroscience Research Australia](https://newatlas.com/tag/neuroscience-research-australia/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Brain%20retraining%20therapy%20offers%20new%20hope%20for%20chronic%20pain%20sufferers&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fchronic-pain%2Fbrain-retraining-therapy-chronic-pain-unsw%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/brain-retraining-therapy-chronic-pain-unsw/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

The finding could improve the treatment of both mental, emotional and physical afflictions.\nResearch into the effects of psychedelics continues to make significant inroads in terms of the methods in which the mind-altering substances can improve our health.\nA study last year showed that psilocybin was [as effective as a commonly prescribed drug at alleviating depression](https://newatlas.com/psychedelics/psilocybin-escitalopram-depression-well-being/), and actually helped improve overall quality of life over the pharmaceutical. A 2023 study showed that psychedelic substances were effective in [improving the mental health symptoms and cognitive function](https://newatlas.com/science/psychedelics-improve-mental-health-and-cognition-in-special-ops-vets/) of traumatized Special Operations Forces veterans. An even earlier study revealed the substances' role in [improving long-term creative thinking](https://newatlas.com/psilocybin-psychedelic-creative-thinking-long-term-effects/58784/).\nDiving deeper into the role psychedelics have on our bodies, researchers at Mass General Brigham found that during chronic stress, our immune systems send inflammatory cells called monocytes to the amygdala, the brain region responsible for processing our emotions – especially fear, anxiety and aggression. Once there, these cells trigger the body's fear response as well as its inflammatory signaling.\nMost interestingly, though, using mouse models, the team found that the psychedelics psilocybin and MDMA blocked the monocytes from collecting in the brain, thus hampering the immune system's ability to spark fear and create an inflammatory response.\n\"When chronic stress disrupts this signaling, it leads to a cascade involving brain-resident cells and immune cells that ultimately increases fear behavior,\" said research lead, Michael Wheeler. \"What is fascinating is that psychedelic compounds can reverse this entire process.\"\nThe researchers also saw a similar response when looking at human brain cells and gene expression data collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), showing that their findings could have implications in treating depression as well as fear-based disorders.\n\"Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions,\" said Wheeler. \"This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and depression.\"\nThe researchers say that uncovering this previously unseen link between the immune system's ability to trigger the fear response and its interruption by psychedelics warrants further research. They now plan to study how the long-term use of psychedelics can affect patients with inflammatory diseases or MDD. They'll accomplish this by analyzing the tissue samples of patients in a clinical trial in which psychedelics are being used to treat patients with depression.\n\"We’re not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition,\" concludes Wheeler. \"But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments.\"\nThe research has been published in the journal [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08880-9).\nSources: [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/psychedelics-can-reverse-neuroimmune-interactions-that-boost-fear), [_Genomic Press_](https://genomicpress.com/) via [EurekAlert ](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082048)\n## Tags\n[Psychedelics](https://newatlas.com/psychedelics/)[Psychedelic Medicine](https://newatlas.com/tag/psychedelic-medicine/)[psilocybin](https://newatlas.com/tag/psilocybin/)[Depression](https://newatlas.com/tag/depression/)[mental health](https://newatlas.com/tag/mental-health/)[Mass General Brigham](https://newatlas.com/tag/mass-general-brigham/)[The Immune System](https://newatlas.com/tag/immune-system/)[Inflammation](https://newatlas.com/tag/inflammation/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Immune%20system%20found%20to%20trigger%20fear%2C%20but%20psychedelics%20block%20it&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fpsychedelics%2Fpsychedelics-fear-immunity%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/psychedelics/psychedelics-fear-immunity/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/michael-franco/)\n[Michael Franco](https://newatlas.com/author/michael-franco/)\nMichael Franco has combined a masters degree in creative writing with a passion for peeking under the hood of life on Earth to write about the serious and silly sides of science and technology for years.

In 2025, we're going autonomous: a Utah-based startup is set to launch a pilot project running its autonomous road-rail vehicle on California's Skunk Train route this year.\nGlid Technologies, which hails from Salt Lake City, has partnered with Mendocino Railway to integrate the former's Glider M hybrid-powered manned road-to-rail vehicle, along with an autonomous version, onto [the 40-mile heritage and freight route](https://www.skunktrain.com/) along the Willits-to-Fort Bragg corridor in California.\nRoad-to-rail vehicles, sometimes called hi-rail vehicles, typically find use in transporting goods, infrastructure construction and utility maintenance work, and emergency response. From [Glid's website](https://glidrail.com/), it appears the company is focused purely on moving cargo at this point: mined materials, agricultural produce, waste, and military equipment.\nThe announcement reveals an intent to \"revitalize underutilized infrastructure, decarbonize local supply chains, and reimagine logistics for rural and underserved communities.\" Indeed, the project sounds like it could help make better use of this historic Californian rail route, and help Glid further develop its hybrid vehicle tech to offer cheaper freight options to logistics companies.\nHonestly, I'm just here to see if Glid's vehicles are for real. The startup's futuristic Glider vehicle looks like a rolling platform with wheels and no cab for a driver. It's said to be able to carry a fully loaded semi trailer weighing up to 80,000 lb (36,000 kg) on asphalt, and then hop on to rails to travel at up to 80 mph (129 km/h).\nGlid says these will be equipped with autonomous tech to \"enable them to autonomously connect to the king pin and rear axel of a semi-trailer and then drive from our private lots and onto the rails, without ever needing a driver.\" They can then be remotely controlled by humans from a central command center.\nGlid says that autonomous model will be fully electric; it's also got the GliderM Alpha, a biodiesel hybrid road-to-rail truck destined for the Skunk Train route. Check out a 3D-rendered demonstration of the vehicle in the video below:\nGlider M Preview\nThe company boasts patented tech, a purchase order with an unnamed trucked company, and leadership with experience at futuristic transport companies like Canoo and SpaceX. However, I haven't been able to find a whole lot more about the company's operations, or get a look at the company's vehicle prototypes out in the real world. Hopefully that's just my myopia and there's a lot happening behind the scenes. We'll keep an eye out for these driverless hi-rails and share more when there's stuff to show you.\nSource: [Glid](https://glidrail.com/) via [EIN Presswire](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/807763580/gl-d-and-mendocino-railway-forge-strategic-partnership-to-accelerate-autonomous-freight-mobility-in-northern-california)\n[ View gallery - 4 images ](https://newatlas.com/transport/autonomous-road-rail-truck-glid-2025/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Transport](https://newatlas.com/transport/)[Railways](https://newatlas.com/tag/railways/)[Truck](https://newatlas.com/tag/truck/)[Self-Driving](https://newatlas.com/tag/self-driving/)[Autonomous](https://newatlas.com/tag/autonomous/)[Cargo](https://newatlas.com/tag/cargo/)[Logistics](https://newatlas.com/tag/logistics/)[Hybrid](https://newatlas.com/tag/hybrid/)[Electric Vehicles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+vehicle/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Cab-less%20truck%20glider%20leaps%20autonomously%20between%20road%20and%20rail%20&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Ftransport%2Fautonomous-road-rail-truck-glid-2025%2F)\n\n\n[ 3 comments ](https://newatlas.com/transport/autonomous-road-rail-truck-glid-2025/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

That’s because the standard EEG typically uses 21 of them, affixed to the scalp in [strategic positions](https://www.tmsi.artinis.com/blog/the-10-20-system-for-eeg#:~:text=The%2010%2D20%20system%20was,the%20method%20of%20EEG%20placement.&text=The%20numbers%20%E2%80%9C10%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9C,%2Dleft\\)%20of%20the%20skull.) to capture activity from various brain regions.\nHowever, a team of researchers from Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) has ushered in the future of EEG, developing a single electrode that looks just like a strand of hair and is more reliable than the standard, multi-electrode version.\n“This electrode allows for more consistent and reliable monitoring of EEG signals and can be worn without being noticeable, which enhances both functionality and patient comfort,” said [Tao Zhou](https://www.esm.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=tzz5199), a professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State and the study’s co-corresponding author.\nUsed to record the brain’s electrical activity, an EEG is important for diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditions such as epilepsy, seizures, [sleep disorders](https://newatlas.com/medical/sleep-studies-simplified/), and brain damage. The rigidity of the electrodes used in current EEGs means that even slight movement introduces noise and artifacts into the recording and limits the ability of patients to move freely. Commonly, “wet electrodes” are used, which require the application of conductive gel to maintain proper contact with the scalp. That approach is messy (think gel in the hair), and because the gel tends to dry out over time, it must be reapplied to maintain signal quality.\n“This will change the impedance – or interface – between the electrodes and the scalp and it can affect the brain signal that’s recorded,” Zhou said. “We also don’t always apply the electrodes in the exact same position either because we’re human. But if you change the position, even a little bit, the brain signals you’re monitoring can be different.”\nWith these downsides in mind, Penn State researchers developed their gel-less “stick-and-play” device for EEG monitoring. It’s designed to be worn continuously for long periods while not interfering with the wearer’s usual activities or drawing attention to its presence. To that end, the electrode portion of the device is 3D-printed using a polymer hydrogel to be 300 μm wide. It looks like a single strand of hair. (By the way, it can be printed using different biocompatible dyes to ensure the device matches the hair color of the wearer.) The electrode is attached to the scalp using a 3D-printable bioadhesive that, on testing, was found to be almost double the strength of commercial EEG gel. It stayed on after showering and exercise-induced sweating, but did not cause damage to the skin when it was removed.\nThe researchers tested the device’s long-term adhesion and electrical performance and compared it to the current, standard EEG using multiple electrodes. Even while human test subjects performed their regular activities, the electrode remained securely attached to the scalp for 24 hours. Impedance remained stable with no noticeable increase after 12 or 24 hours, meaning that the quality of the brain activity signal didn’t change. The hairlike device maintained better skin contact than the regular gel-dependent approach and eliminated motion artifacts.\n“You don’t have to worry if the position of the electrode has changed or if the impedance has changed because the electrodes haven’t moved,” said Zhou.\nCurrently, the hairlike EEG device is wired, so patients must be connected to a machine while their brain activity is recorded. However, the researchers hope to develop a wireless version and foresee many applications for the device.\n“This technology holds promise for use in consumer health and wellness products, enabling the development of advanced wearable devices that can monitor [mental health](https://newatlas.com/science/eeg-brain-activity-microstate-schizophrenia-endophenotype/), stress levels, and cognitive functions discreetly,” they said. “It could also be integrated into brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, enhancing their usability and comfort, thereby expanding their application in fields such as assistive technology for individuals with disabilities, virtual reality (VR) experiences, and even enhancing human-computer interaction in everyday tasks.”\nThe study was published in the journal [_NPJ – Biomedical Innovations_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44385-025-00009-x).\nSource: [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/future-brain-activity-monitoring-may-look-strand-hair)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/medical-devices/3d-printed-hairlike-eeg-electrode/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Medical Devices](https://newatlas.com/medical-devices/)[Electroencephalography (EEG)](https://newatlas.com/tag/electroencephalography/)[Brain activity](https://newatlas.com/tag/brain-activity/)[Epilepsy](https://newatlas.com/tag/epilepsy/)[3D Printing](https://newatlas.com/tag/3d-printing/)[Pennsylvania State University](https://newatlas.com/tag/pennsylvania-state-university/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Single%20hair-like%20electrode%20outperforms%20traditional%2021-lead%20EEG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fmedical-devices%2F3d-printed-hairlike-eeg-electrode%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/medical-devices/3d-printed-hairlike-eeg-electrode/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\n[Paul McClure](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-mcclure/)\nPaul brings extensive knowledge and real-world experience to New Atlas.

It's now raised CAD 20 million in a funding round to [build Hub I](https://exterracarbon.com/project/hub-one-project/), which it says will be the world's biggest facility for dealing with asbestos mine tailings (AMT).\nThere are a couple of interesting things about this story: the first is why it's unfolding in Canada.\nYou probably know asbestos as a group of fire-retardant minerals that were initially celebrated for their applications in construction and safety gear. You might also know that it's composed of microscopic 'fibrils' that can be released into the atmosphere, and can cause life-threatening lung conditions when inhaled. \nWhat you might not know is that the [half of the world's supply of this material once came from the Jeffrey Mine](https://catalyst.earth/the-jeffrey-asbestos-mine-quebec/) in the Central Canadian town of Asbestos, Quebec (now known as Val-des-Sources).\nThis open-pit mine, measuring 1,140 ft (350 m) deep and more than two sq miles (six sq km) in size, along with other mines, are said to have [made Canada the largest exporter of asbestos back in the 1970s](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180529-the-town-fighting-its-killer-reputation). And although it was decommissioned in 2012, Quebec led Canada in reported cases of mesothelioma, a deadly lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos, as recently as 2018.\nSo what does Exterra plan to do with these asbestos mines? The company says its Hub I asbestos mitigation plant will use AMT to make low-carbon metal oxides (including magnesium oxide, which finds use in healthcare, wastewater treatment, and agriculture), as well as nickel concentrate, which is used in EV batteries.\nIt will also use a proprietary technology to process these oxides to permanently sequester CO2 into minerals for millennia in one step. This process doesn't need a separate system to capture the CO2. Exterra's facility will also destroy any remaining asbestos fibers (safely, I'm assuming). With renewable energy powering its plants, the entire operation will remain carbon neutral.\nExterra says it has already trialed its tech in pre-commercial pilot operations in Val-des-Sources, and aims to begin construction of Hub I in 2027. Its facility will process over 300,000 tons of AMT each year once it's up and running. \n\"With this funding, we’ll accelerate commercializing our dual-pronged platform that valorizes over 90% of minerals from asbestos residues while creating one of the shortest nickel supply chains for EV electrification in North America,\" said CEO Olivier Dufresne.\nThe company hopes to be the first in the world to commercialize carbon-neutral mineral production from mine tailings. It will surely have its work cut out for it: there's lots of AMT available in Quebec alone, potentially up to 800 million tons. So if my math is right, that will keep the Hub I facility busy for 2,667 years. \nSource: [Exterra](https://exterracarbon.com/)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/environment/asbestos-dangerous-waste-valuable-materials-exterra-canada/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Environment](https://newatlas.com/environment/)[Electric Vehicles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+vehicle/)[Minerals](https://newatlas.com/tag/minerals/)[Mining](https://newatlas.com/tag/mining/)[Canada](https://newatlas.com/tag/canada/)[Carbon Dioxide](https://newatlas.com/tag/carbon-dioxide/)[Carbon Sequestration](https://newatlas.com/tag/carbon-sequestration/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Massive%20asbestos%20operation%20turns%20dangerous%20waste%20to%20valuable%20materials&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fenvironment%2Fasbestos-dangerous-waste-valuable-materials-exterra-canada%2F)\n\n\n[ No comments ](https://newatlas.com/environment/asbestos-dangerous-waste-valuable-materials-exterra-canada/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

Buzz, but we didn't previously know exactly how it worked. The Dutch camper specialist released a video this month showing the new expandable sleeper roof design in action and detailing a few specs and advantages. The new pop-top leverages aspects of rooftop tent design to create a larger bed and more spacious living area, bringing a new level of comfort to all-electric [ID. Buzz camping](https://newatlas.com/automotive/volkswagen-id-buzz-ququq-camper-review/). \nTonke's main objective in going with an unconventional side-popping roof with expandable floor is to expand the size of the integrated bed that would otherwise be limited by a 78-in (199-cm) maximum van width that further tapers inward at the roof. The lifting roof has been designed specifically for the 193-in (490-cm) long-wheelbase ID. Buzz, ultimately freeing up space for a 53 x 83-in (135 x 210 cm) longitudinal bed extending out off the van's side. \nWhen we first saw the design, we assumed that it popped open first, with the extended floor folding out like an [iKamper Skycamp](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/ikamper-skycamp-dlx-rooftop-tent/) and many other modern rooftop tents. Instead, it relies on a slide-out floor extension that pulls the outer fabric along with it to automatically pitch the tent. \nTo set up, the user simply raises the roof manually with help from the integrated struts, slides the sleeper panel out over the side of the van and installs the two awning poles. Two ground support poles add stability below, much like the ladder of an expandable rooftop tent does.\nBeyond just adding space for a larger bed, the side-opening sleeper roof design also maintains full standing height inside, without ever having to lift up the sleeper platform as you'd do on a standard pop-up camper roof. Removable safety rails on the upper bed can be installed to avoid any possibility of rolling off the bed into the van cabin below, a nice feature for young children. The expansion area also features integrated LED lighting and USB charging. \nBack outside, the expansion extends 31.5 in (80 cm) off the side of the van, designed to maintain a compact total footprint so as not to prevent drivers from accessing tight camping spots. That compact size limits the amount of shade it will cast, but it does offer at least some of the overhead protection of an awning, without needing to buy and mount a separate piece of gear. \nThe roof increases the height of the ID. Buzz to 81 in (206 cm).\nThe new roof lists at €8,470 (approx. US$9,575) for the full kit, plus €3,025 ($3,425) for installation. Buyers can also add a body-matching color (€1,271) and a 200-W solar panel system (€1,936 with installation). \nThe roof could presumably work on its own as something of an upstairs sleeper space for two travelers or it can work as part of one of Tonke's camper van packages. Those start at €5,996 ($6,775) for a basic [camper-in-a-box module](https://newatlas.com/automotive/tonke-vw-id-buzz-module-camper-kit/), rising to €18,150 ($20,550) for the complete built-in [Explorer camper van floor plan](https://newatlas.com/automotive/tonke-volkswagen-buzz-pop-up-camper-van/) with indoor/outdoor kitchen. Tonke also sells ID.

Scientists make their mark on micro-animals\nScientists have tattooed live tardigrades with patterns made up of squares, lines and dots (pictured)\nAdapted from Nano Letters 2025, DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c00378\nView 1 Image \n1/1\nScientists have tattooed live tardigrades with patterns made up of squares, lines and dots (pictured)\nAdapted from Nano Letters 2025, DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c00378\nIf you're going to try \"tattooing\" a microscopic animal, it would make sense to select one of the toughest creatures on the planet. That's exactly what scientists have done with the tardigrade, and the tech they used could have some valuable real-world applications.\nAlso known as water bears and moss piglets, tardigrades are pudgy eight-legged micro-animals that typically grow no larger than half a millimeter in length. Along with having become a pop cultural sensation, they are [widely known](https://newatlas.com/biology/tardigrades-indestructible-stress/) for their ability to withstand extreme cold, heat, dryness, and even the vacuum of outer space.\nThis reputation made the animals a natural choice for Ding Zhao, Min Qiu and colleagues at China's Westlake University, who wanted to test a method of printing patterns onto living microorganisms without harming them.\nAmong other things, the technology may one day be used to create cyborg micro-robots that perform biomedical functions via sensors or other electronics printed directly onto their bodies. The tech might also have applications in fields such as cryopreservation and astrobiology.\nFor their study, the scientists started by slowly dehydrating live tardigrades, thus putting them in a state of suspended animation. Each creature was then placed on a sheet of carbon-composite paper which got cooled to a temperature of -226 ºF (-143 ºC). Next, the tardigrade was covered with an organic liquid known as anisole, which froze into a thin layer of ice.\nWhen an electron beam was subsequently focused onto specific areas of the animal's body, the frozen anisole in those locations reacted by forming into a new biocompatible chemical.\nAs the tardigrade was then warmed back to room temperature within a vacuum, that chemical firmly adhered to the creature's outer cuticle, forming a visible pattern. The rest of the anisole ice, which had _not_ been exposed to the electron beam, disappeared by transforming directly into vapor.\nWhen rehydrated, approximately 40% of the tardigrades survived and became active again, showing no signs of being bothered by the tattoos. It is believed that the survival rate should significantly improve as the technique is refined. And importantly, the markings remained stable even after stretching, immersion in solvent, rinsing and drying.\n\"Through this technology, we’re not just creating micro-tattoos on tardigrades – we’re extending this capability to various living organisms, including bacteria,\" says Zhao.\nThe research is described in a paper that was recently published in the journal [_Nano Letters_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c00378).\nSource: [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/april/scientists-have-found-a-way-to-tattoo-tardigrades.html)\n## Tags\n[Science](https://newatlas.com/science/)[Tattoo](https://newatlas.com/tag/tattoo/)[Cyborg](https://newatlas.com/tag/cyborg/)[American Chemical Society](https://newatlas.com/tag/american-chemical-society/)[Microbes](https://newatlas.com/tag/microbes/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Tattooed%20tardigrades%21%20Scientists%20make%20their%20mark%20on%20micro-animals&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fscience%2Ftattooed-tardigrades%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/science/tattooed-tardigrades/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

It's also likely to be cheaper and not suffer the same kind of supply-chain shortages that existing therapeutics have faced. But it's been a dramatic few weeks for the leading three drug-makers vying to usher in this new phase of weight-loss treatment.\nIt's no surprise that this is one of the most hotly contested therapeutics races of the decade: Last year, the global glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist market was [estimated to be worth US$53.5 million](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/glp-1-receptor-agonist-market). Some estimates suggest it'll be worth more than [$150 billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044263/28124/en/GLP-1-Market-Industry-Trends-and-Global-Forecasts-2024-2035-Over-150-GLP-1-Drug-Candidates-in-Development-for-Multiple-Indications-Type-2-Diabetes-and-Obesity-Drive-GLP-1-Drug-Deve.html) by 2035. \nAnd while it's only a matter of time until Ozempic-like drugs are available as oral medication, the past few weeks have seem one small victory and a huge setback for some of the big players in the field.\nAmid profits updates and shareholder news, Pfizer released a [statement](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-provides-update-oral-glp-1-receptor-agonist) titled \"Pfizer provides update on oral GLP-1 receptor agonist danuglipron.\" The company quietly announced that it was ditching its once-daily oral drug due to liver toxicity concerns following analysis of Phase III trial data. \n\"While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class, a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron,\" Pfizer said in the statement.\nLittle more is known about the specifications of the liver injury, but the participant experienced elevated enzymes in the organ, which is a red flag for cell damage. But we're unlikely to know more until the trial data is \"presented at a scientific forum or submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the future.\" \n“While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients,\" said Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development at Pfizer. \nIn [December 2023](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-topline-phase-2b-results-oral-glp-1r), Pfizer scrapped development of a twice-daily danuglipron drug because of adverse side effects that included nearly 50% of participants experiencing vomiting.\nHowever, the ones to watch are Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which now have their own GLP-1 oral drugs nearing the finish line. Just three days after the Pfizer news, [Eli Lilly announced positive results](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-statistically) from its Phase III trial of weight-loss drug candidate orforglipron. \nHowever, these results are just one part of the Phase III evaluation, with the drug being assessed for bot diabetes and obesity treatment. \n\"[The trial] ACHIEVE-1 is the first of seven Phase II studies examining the safety and efficacy of orforglipron across people with diabetes and obesity. We are pleased to see that our latest incretin medicine meets our expectations for safety and tolerability, glucose control and weight loss, and we look forward to additional data readouts later this year,\" said David A. Ricks , Eli Lilly chair and CEO. \"As a convenient once-daily pill, orforglipron may provide a new option and, if approved, could be readily manufactured and launched at scale for use by people around the world.\"\nLike danuglipron, orforglipron is a small molecule (non-peptide) oral drug designed to be taken anytime, with or without food. In the results so far, the 40-week trial saw participants with type 2 diabetes lose an average of 16 pounds (7.25 kg), or almost 8% of their body weight. The company is expected to apply for Food and Drug Administration approval this year, with the suite of Phase III results expected by the end of 2025 or early 2026.\nFinally, and the most likely company to get the first oral GLP-1 drug to market, Novo Nordisk has had a big win this week, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [accepting its application](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-accepts-filing-application-for-oral-semaglutide-25-mg-which-if-approved-would-be-the-first-oral-glp-1-treatment-for-obesity-302445232.html) for review. While it's not a home run yet, the Danish pharmaceutical giant is understandably confident the drug will pass its final hurdle. \n\"We are entering a new era of obesity care where patients want individualized treatment plans that address their needs and provide choices, including oral formulations,\" said Anna Windle, Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Medical & Regulatory Affairs at the company. \"Novo Nordisk's strong legacy in obesity care and decades of scientific research and innovation have brought us to this moment. We are pleased that the FDA has accepted our submission and look forward to working with regulatory authorities on what would be the first oral GLP-1 treatment for obesity.\"\nThe drug, an oral dose of its Wegovy medication, passed its final safety and efficacy tests in its 64-week OASIS 4 Phase III trial, which involved 307 adults who were overweight or obese and did not have diabetes. \nThe FDA's decision on oral Wegovy is expected as early as October 2025. Novo Nordisk already has an oral semaglutide drug, Rybelsus, on the market but it's only approved for diabetes management. \nSources: [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-provides-update-oral-glp-1-receptor-agonist), [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/) via [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-accepts-filing-application-for-oral-semaglutide-25-mg-which-if-approved-would-be-the-first-oral-glp-1-treatment-for-obesity-302445232.html), [Eli Lilly](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-statistically)\n## Tags\n[Obesity](https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/)[Novo Nordisk](https://newatlas.com/tag/novo-nordisk/)[Eli Lilly](https://newatlas.com/tag/eli-lilly/)[Pfizer](https://newatlas.com/tag/pfizer/)[GLP-1](https://newatlas.com/tag/glp1/)[Obesity](https://newatlas.com/tag/obesity/)[Diabetes](https://newatlas.com/tag/diabetes/)[clinical trials](https://newatlas.com/tag/clinical-trials/)[Drugs](https://newatlas.com/tag/drugs/)[Weight Loss](https://newatlas.com/tag/weight-loss/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Breakthrough%20weight-loss%20pill%20expected%20to%20launch%20within%2012%20months&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fdisease%2Fobesity%2Fozempic-weight-loss-pill%2F)\n\n\n[ 4 comments ](https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/ozempic-weight-loss-pill/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\n[Bronwyn Thompson](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\nBronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

The system can use water or foam, and the quadruped can automatically uncouple the hose and potentially move on to other tasks without missing a beat.\nThis module also includes a sprinkler system that's not designed to put out fires, but to keep the robot itself cool when all around is not. That means the quadruped is dust- and waterproof, while composite metal materials for the body also contribute to its extreme environment readiness.\nOne more module worthy of mention is an air-blower unit \"to extinguish forest fires safely by cutting the connection between flames and combustibles.\"\nUnitree has also boosted joint performance over a standard B2 by 170%, giving the robodog extra climbing power for tackling obstacles as high as 40 cm (15 in) and stairs with a 45-degree slant. And finally, the fire rescue bot benefits from a hot-swap battery system for extended use in the field without compromising waterproofing.\nA number of drills and demos have already taken place to prove the robodog's fire-fighting mettle, and a pair recently joined the Qingdao Firefighting and Rescue Support Team in an official capacity. Units are now available for sale, though we've no word on pricing.

That puts it at risk of being removed from the stock exchange altogether – and could be a sign of the end of Damon before getting even a single electric bike off the production line.\nThe Vancouver-based outfit initially aimed to pack high-tech safety features into desirable electric motorcycles – and subsequently pivoted focus towards performance-oriented machines that would put out 200 hp and hit speeds of 200 mph (321 kmph), a whole lot [faster than rival Zero's offerings](https://newatlas.com/tag/zero-motorcycles/).\nThings weren't looking too bad then: what's not to love about a quick bike with tons of power, an electrically adjustable riding position, fast charging, and a 360º Advanced Motorcycle Warning System in a single good-looking package? \nDamon also noted that it planned to drop its integrated powertrain platform into multiple models, which could make it easier to go into production.\nThe company had begun work on a production facility in Canada's province of British Columbia, and according to RideApart, [quietly ditched that plan at some point in 2023](https://www.rideapart.com/features/750361/damon-motorcycles-electric-ev-derek-dorresteyn-leaves/). Meanwhile, it had gone through layoffs, and missed its production deadlines multiple times.\nCome November 2024, Damon had [launched an IPO](https://ir.damon.com/2024-11-18-Damon-Inc-Nasdaq-DMN-Makes-Nasdaq-Debut-With-Over-100-Million-in-Reservations) and began trading its shares on the Nasdaq exchange, touting its US$100 million in reservations from some 3,000 prospective customers for its fully faired Hypersport and naked Hyperfighter models, with prices starting at $23,000 and $22,000 respectively.\nThe following month, Dominique Kwong, co-founder and CTO, [took over as interim CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRB7be7wYU). In an interview around then, Kwong noted the need for Damon to take a closer look at the personal mobility industry, and talked about getting the message about the Damon 2.0 brand out to the market sooner – without losing its focus on high-performance machines.\nBut where are the bikes? RideApart's Jonathon Klein noted in February they're likely not going to happen, as the company has been plagued by a chaotic working environment and \"petulant\" executives making it near impossible for the team to actually produce vehicles.\nWithout a production vehicle or shareholder confidence in sight, it appears Damon is cooked at this point. The firm has been granted a hearing on May 20 by Nasdaq to present a compliance plan – a strategy outlining steps it'll take to raise its share price above $1 and stay above that price, to avoid being delisted from the exchange.\nThat's no beuno for investors, and it's unclear whether Damon will be able to turn things around soonish. Getting an electric motorcycle brand off the ground is no doubt a major challenge, and the current state of affairs could very well mean the end for this Canadian upstart. \nIf you had reserved one of those 3,000 motorcycles that Damon promised to begin manufacturing next year, don't hold your breath. We've reached out to the company for comment, and will update this post when we hear back.\nSources: [Visordown](https://www.visordown.com/news/damon-motorcycles-trouble-stocks-plummet), [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/sec-filings/damon-inc-faces-nasdaq-delisting-over-shareholder-dilution-concerns-93CH-4013773)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/damon-motorcycles-stock-wipeout/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Motorcycles](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/)[Electric Motorcycles](https://newatlas.com/tag/electric+motorcycle/)[Damon Motorcycles](https://newatlas.com/tag/damon-motorcycles/)[Business](https://newatlas.com/tag/business/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Wildly%20innovative%20200-mph%20e-motorcycle%20now%20in%20serious%20trouble&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fmotorcycles%2Fdamon-motorcycles-stock-wipeout%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/damon-motorcycles-stock-wipeout/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

The US$18.8-billion total figure decreases spending by $6 billion, or 24%, as the space agency increases funding for crewed Moon and Mars missions.\nThe new budget request not only reflects the Trump administration's policy to curb federal spending, it also marks a shift in NASA's priorities that involves more than simple bookkeeping. For decades, NASA has been at the center of a multi-directional tug of war over not only money, but the question of what the American space program should be in the 21st century.\nThe most conspicuous change that will occur if the budget is approved is that both the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) will end with the Artemis III mission scheduled to fly in, perhaps, 2027. Already beleaguered by significant delays and cost overruns, there have already been calls to cancel the projects in favor of more advanced and cost effective commercial competitors.\n[Orion](https://newatlas.com/space/orion-spacecraft-leaves-lunar-orbit-heads-home/) is already $20 billion in the hole and has suffered ongoing setbacks, including problems with its life support system and heat shield. Meanwhile, SLS is decades behind schedule and has eaten through $24 billion. Worse, each launch of the disposable SLS costs an estimated $4 billion and can only fly once every two years. Beyond that, it has been criticized as an Apollo-light project using 1970s era Space Shuttle technology and being organized less as a cutting-edge space venture and more as a job creation program for congressional constituencies and aerospace contractors.\nAlong with these, NASA is also pulling the plug on [Gateway](https://newatlas.com/space/nasa-esa-agreement-build-gateway-deep-space/). Originally planned as an outpost in cislunar orbit that would act as a stopping-off point for lunar landing and Mars expeditions, it has received criticism as unnecessary and that with current delays it will not enter service until the mid-2030s. The new budget will end the Gateway project and transfer the completed components to other missions.\nHowever, these cuts do not reflect an overall winding down of the Artemis program. Far from it. The budget allocates an increase of $7 billion for crewed lunar exploration, with an additional billion dollars going to a projected crewed mission to Mars – especially as a counter to China's increasingly ambitious efforts to land astronauts on the Moon and Mars.\nAnother aspect of the budget is to eliminate missions that are seen as not cost effective in terms of science returns for money invested. The top candidate for cancellation is the Mars Sample Return mission budgeted at up to $11 billion that would not fly until the middle of the next decade. Other possible sacrifices could be the continuation of the aging Chandra X-ray Observatory with an annual operating cost of $70 million, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope for studying dark energy at a cost of $3 billion and has been cited as being redundant compared to other missions, and $1.161 billion for Earth science missions.\nThe last of these is significant because it shows the ascendance of advocates who have for decades pushed for NASA to move away from space launch vehicles, low Earth orbit stations, and Earth monitoring missions in favor of deep space missions, human spaceflight, and cutting-edge technology while leaving many traditional space roles to commercial firms.\nAlong with this, the budget cuts loose green aviation projects and focuses more attention to aiding the FAA in fulfilling the administration's directive to modernize America's alarmingly antiquated air traffic control system.\nOne understated part of the budget is the pivoting to winding down US participation in the International Space Station (ISS) prior to its decommissioning and deorbiting in 2030. Part of the reason may be budgetary, but [recent reports](https://www.sustainability-times.com/impact/nasa-says-were-on-the-brink-alarming-new-report-reveals-imminent-emergency-crash-risk-for-the-entire-space-station/#:~:text=During%20a%20recent%20meeting%20of,purpose%2C%E2%80%9D%20have%20sparked%20debate.) suggest that the ISS may be in worse shape than previously thought, with cracks and air leaks threatening to force the orbital lab's evacuation and disposal much earlier than anticipated. As a result, NASA seems to be pushing harder for private companies to develop their own space stations and to fast track the development of the propulsion system needed to lower the ISS into the Earth's atmosphere for a controlled burn up.\n\"This proposal includes investments to simultaneously pursue exploration of the Moon and Mars while still prioritizing critical science and technology research,\" said acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro. \"I appreciate the President’s continued support for NASA’s mission and look forward to working closely with the administration and Congress to ensure we continue making progress toward achieving the impossible.\"\nSource: [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/president-trumps-fy26-budget-revitalizes-human-space-exploration/)\n[ View gallery - 5 images ](https://newatlas.com/space/orion-moonship-sls-get-chop-new-nasa-budget/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Space](https://newatlas.com/space/)[NASA](https://newatlas.com/tag/nasa/)[Mars](https://newatlas.com/tag/mars/)[Moon](https://newatlas.com/tag/moon/)[Orion Spacecraft](https://newatlas.com/tag/orion-spacecraft/)[Gateway](https://newatlas.com/tag/gateway/)[SLS](https://newatlas.com/tag/sls/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=NASA%20budget%20axes%20several%20missions%2C%20SLS%20and%20a%20space%20station&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fspace%2Forion-moonship-sls-get-chop-new-nasa-budget%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/space/orion-moonship-sls-get-chop-new-nasa-budget/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\n[David Szondy](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\nDavid Szondy is a playwright, author and journalist based in Seattle, Washington.

In fact, just hours ago, a new video just popped up where he's wearing a Stormtrooper costume in the forest while he flies around. Just in time for May 4th excitement?\nOver the last few days since the video release, the internet seems mostly in this collective \"WHOA! But...?\" But nothing. There's virtually zero information about it except it can do 124 mph (200 km/h), it's made of lightweight materials like carbon fiber, it is 3D printed, and it's [jet-powered](https://newatlas.com/gravity-jet-suit-sale/55568/).\nThere's not even real audio of this \"airbike\" in action which might give us at least an idea of what's happening. Today's Stormtrooper video is just Star Wars audio overlay – sans [laser blaster](https://newatlas.com/diy-laser-rifle/30124/) pew-pews – that make it sound like a speeder on Endor. Clever green screen? An elaborately painted-out crane and wires setup?\nWhat the Volonaut Airbike _does_ have going for it, however, is that it's the alleged creation of Tomasz Patan – the guy responsible for the [Jetson One](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/jetson-aero-personal-evtol/) ... another mobility toy that you just have to [see to believe](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/jetson-agility-evtol/). Knowing that, one may be inclined to think the Volonaut Airbike _could_ exist and isn't simply movie-magic.\nWe've reached out to the Jetson co-founder with questions like \"What's powering it? How long can it stay airborne?\" We have yet to receive a reply.\nSupposedly the \"superbike for the skies\" Airbike is \"seven times lighter than a typical motorcycle\" from what I'd read on the Volonaut website days ago. In my limited twenty-year career in the motorcycle industry, I'd wager that most \"superbikes\" range around 390 lb (177 kg). Seven times lighter would be exactly 55.7 lb (25.3 kg).\nTo be certain, I just looked up the weights of a range of \"typical motorcycles\" to get an average. These are the bikes and weights I used from mostly 2023 models: Yamaha [MT-10](https://newatlas.com/yamaha-mt-10/40435/) (467 lb/212 kg), Honda Shadow Phantom (549 lb/249 kg), Harley-Davidson Sportster S (502 lb/228 kg), [Honda](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/2022-honda-nt1100-sports-tourer-africa-twin/) Gold Wing (804 lb/365 kg), Yamaha [MT-07](https://newatlas.com/yamaha-xsr700-retro-yard-built/38604/) (406 lb/184 kg), Yamaha YZF-R3 (375 lb/170 kg), Kawasaki Ninja 400 (366 lb/166 kg), and Triumph [Speed Triple](https://newatlas.com/motorcycles/triumph-speed-triple-rr-faired/) 1200 RS (437 lb/198 kg).\nIt seems like a fair \"typical motorcycle\" list from the beginner-friendly Yamaha R3 to the elite touring six-cylinder Honda [Goldwing](https://newatlas.com/honda-2018-gl1800-goldwing/51906/) ... and the average weight is 488 lb (221.4 kg). Seven times lighter than that would be 69.7 lb (31.6 kg). Even that's a tough pill to swallow. \nWhy is Volonaut being so secretive? Protecting its IP like its protecting George's legacy?\n\"The creation of the Airbike, kept secret from us Volonaut did. How this was done, we know not,\" said [Yoda](https://newatlas.com/marine/delle-solo-dolphin-baltic-sea/) (or something like that).\nThe company's website says the Airbike is powered by jet propulsion and has no [spinning propellers](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/carve-canyons-evtol-airwolf-hoverbike/), allowing it to travel through tight quarters. In the video, we see what appears to be an air blast below the Airbike like a USAF Harrier coming in for a VTOL landing. Is it hot air? I think I saw a puff of smoke in one frame. If there are \"no spinning blades,\" we're probably talking some kind of micro-turbine burning Jet-A or something, right? Unless there's a hyperdrive stuffed in there somewhere running on [midichlorian](https://newatlas.com/predatory-journals-tricked-fake-paper/50594/)-infused coaxium?\nA single gallon of Jet-A weighs about 6.7 lb (3 kg). That's almost exactly 10% of my calculated \"seven times lighter than\" weight of the Airbike.\nLet's do some more \"best case scenario\" theoretical calculations based on very little information – and by all means, if I'm wrong or missing anything, please let me know in the comments!\nThe Airbike would need to produce roughly ~300 lbf of thrust to \"safely\" carry its ~70 lb (~32 kg) airframe plus a ~160 lb (~73 kg) pilot. A [JetCat P400 Pro](https://www.jetcat.de/en/productdetails/produkte/jetcat/produkte/Professionell/p400%20pro) pumps out about 95 lbf. One engine is about 15 inches long with a roughly 6-inch diameter and weighs about 9 lb ... so three of those at 27 lb totally fall within an acceptable weight range I made up for the Airbike _and_ could fit in the airframe. Each one burns about 7.5 to 9 gallons of Jet-A per hour, meaning a single gallon of Jet-A – again, best case scenario – would last for about a 2-3 minute flight. More fuel, more weight, possibly not enough thrust – you know, the classic \"mass penalty loop\" ...\nIs the \"seven times lighter\" dry weight, before fluids like fuel? What about redundancy if one fails? Does the [Insta360 camera](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Waterproof-Replaceable-Built-Stabilization/dp/B0DZCBYCNY?tag=newatlas-deals-20&th=1) on a selfie stick come with the Airbike for when it goes full lawn dart?\nKeep in mind, this is all just conjecture on my part. If/when we learn what's really powering it, how much it actually weighs, and what the proprietary stabilization system is ... I'll likely be wildly wrong on all my thoughts.\nUntil then, the green-screen-coaxium-hyperdrive-[speeder-bike](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/mayman-aerospace-debuts-flight-ready-speeder-flying-motorbike-prototype/) looks pretty cool in videos. Just needs Ewoks.\nMay the Fourth be with you.\nVolonaut Airbike - Speeder Bike Forest Chase\nSource: [Volonaut](https://volonaut.com/airbike)\n _New Atlas makes a commission on products purchased through our links, and you'll be supporting your favorite news site!

That's where the NXS system comes in, as it's promised to make existing cable-actuated mountain bike derailleurs wireless for less than eighty dollars.\nPresently the subject of a Kickstarter campaign, NXS is manufactured by US startup OG Bikeworks. The current 1X version of the system is claimed to be compatible with all makes and models of cable-actuated mountain bike drivetrains. Versions for road bikes (complete with front derailleurs) are reportedly in the works.\nThe system consists of two components: a rear-derailleur-mounted motorized shifting module and a handlebar-mounted electronic remote. They wirelessly communicate with one another via Bluetooth LE.\nThe shifting module attaches to the derailleur where the original shifting cable entered the latter device, and uses its motor/actuator to pull on a short length of cable that remains anchored to the derailleur. A ball-and-socket mount allows users to adjust the angle of the module relative to the bike, plus it gives way to absorb impact energy in the event of crashes or other mishaps.\nOnce an app has initially been used to calibrate the system to the user's drivetrain, shifting gears is as simple as pressing silicone-covered buttons on the machined-aluminum remote. That remote can also be used to fine-tune gear settings on the fly as needed, and to wirelessly control up to five other peripherals such as dropper seatposts. Its buttons are user-programmable.\nFor \"faster, crisper, and snappier shifts,\" NXS utilizes OG's HyperShift technology. In a nutshell, this involves shifting a little bit _past_ the programmed gear position at first, pausing briefly, then shifting back to the exact gear.\nThe kit supports anywhere from two to 32 gears, and is claimed to be good for about 5,000 shifts per charge of the shifting module's lithium battery. The remote uses a CR2032 coin cell battery that should reportedly last for two to three years. Weight figures come in at 55 g (1.9 oz) for the shifting module, and 23 g (0.8 oz) for the remote. All the electronics are IPX6 waterproof, meaning they can withstand strong jets of water from any direction.\nAssuming everything goes according to plan, a [pledge of US$79](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107180153/nxs-wireless-shifting-open-ecosystem/) will get you an NXS system of your own. We're told that the production price will be approximately $179, which is still _far_ less than purpose-built wireless setups from companies such as [Shimano](https://newatlas.com/shimano-xtr-m9050-di2-electronic-shifting-mountain-bikes/32336/) and [SRAM](https://newatlas.com/sram-wireless-shifting-red-etap/39236/).\n[XShifter](https://newatlas.com/xshifter-electronic-gear-shifting/46169/) and [Archer Components](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/d1x-trail-electronic-gear-shifting/) previously offered NXS-like systems of their own, but both are no longer in production.\nNXS: Wireless Shifting, Open Ecosystem\nSources: [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107180153/nxs-wireless-shifting-open-ecosystem/), [OG Bikeworks](https://ogbikeworks.com/)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/nxs-cable-derailleur-wireless-conversion/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Bicycles](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/)[Kickstarter](https://newatlas.com/tag/kickstarter/)[Cycling](https://newatlas.com/tag/cycling/)[Electronic Shifting Systems](https://newatlas.com/tag/shifting/)[Wireless](https://newatlas.com/tag/wireless/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=NXS%20kit%20converts%20cable%20derailleurs%20to%20wireless%2C%20for%20under%20%2480&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fbicycles%2Fnxs-cable-derailleur-wireless-conversion%2F)\n\n\n[ 3 comments ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/nxs-cable-derailleur-wireless-conversion/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

One facet of this effort was the launch of a series of Venera probes from 1961 to 1984. Despite a depressing number of failures, the program achieved some remarkable firsts, including the first probe to impact another planet, the first sampling of another planet's atmosphere, and the first and, to this day, only landings on Venus.\nLaunched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in what is now Kazakhstan, Kosmos 482 was supposed to be one of these Venus landers, but it failed on liftoff and broke up as it went into orbit around the Earth instead of heading for Venus. For this reason, the spacecraft kept the generic Kosmos name instead of Venera because the Kremlin didn't like to draw attention to its failures.\nThe story should have ended there and would have if the SatTrackCam Leiden blog hadn't taken an interest in Kosmos 482, first arguing in [2022](https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4384/1) that the surviving fragment is the landing capsule and not the interplanetary transfer bus and, this year, noticing that the orbit of the spacecraft is decaying rapidly as it loses altitude.\nAccording to the blog, the present rate of decay will have the capsule hitting the Earth's atmosphere somewhere between 52° North and 52° South latitude on May 10, 2025 ± 2.8 days. This includes includes parts of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada in the north to Argentina, Chile, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the south. The margin of error is because of the many variables that need to be accounted for, the biggest one being how variations in the Sun's activity can expand or contract that atmosphere.\nAside from being a bit of historical interest, this raises the question of, so what? Space debris burns up in the Earth's atmosphere practically everyday. What's one more 53-year-old piece of junk?\nThe so what is that the landing capsule consists of instruments sealed inside a semi-globular titanium protective shell weighing a total of 1,091 lb (472 kg) that's designed to withstand passage through the Venusian atmosphere, which is 90 times as dense as ours, and then survive on the surface of Venus for over an hour where it rains sulfuric acid and the temperature is that of molten lead.\nIn short, it's a tough little basket and, if it doesn't break up on reentry due to previous damage, it stands a very good chance of reaching the ground.\nHowever, there isn't much cause for alarm. If you're in the Arctic or Antarctic, you're out of the impact zone. If you're in it, bear in mind that the Earth is three-fourths water and that a surprising amount of the land area is completely uninhabited or has a very small population density, so the odds of the capsule pranging on top of someone are extremely low.\nIn other words, unless you're the sort who banks their retirement on winning the lottery, you can relax.\nSource: [SatTrackCam Leiden](https://sattrackcam.blogspot.com/2025/04/kosmos-842-descent-craft-reentry.html)\n[ View gallery - 5 images ](https://newatlas.com/space/soviet-venus-lander-kosmos-482-predicted-to-crash/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Space](https://newatlas.com/space/)[USSR](https://newatlas.com/tag/ussr/)[Roscosmos](https://newatlas.com/tag/roscosmos/)[Venus](https://newatlas.com/tag/venus/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Cold%20War-era%20Soviet%20probe%20set%20to%20crash%20back%20to%20Earth%20next%20week&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fspace%2Fsoviet-venus-lander-kosmos-482-predicted-to-crash%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/space/soviet-venus-lander-kosmos-482-predicted-to-crash/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\n[David Szondy](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\nDavid Szondy is a playwright, author and journalist based in Seattle, Washington.

(Well, it's rechargeable until you eat it.)\nResearchers from Switzerland's École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) have formed an unlikely collaboration team with pastry chefs and food scientists to create the RoboCake, currently on show at Osaka's Expo 2025.\nBut this is a cake with a bit of a twist. Sitting atop the elaborate piece are edible robotic bears, which are reported to taste like pomegranate gummies, which have an internal pneumatic system that provides movement for their limbs and head. And, yes, these little dancing robots are completely edible.\n“They are made from gelatin, syrup and colorants,” said Bokeon Kwak, a researcher at EPFL's Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS).\nNot to be outdone, IIT researchers have made the world's first edible rechargeable battery, using a recipe of vitamin B2, quercetin, activated carbon and chocolate.\n“These batteries, safe for consumption, can be used to light the LED candles on the cake,” said Valerio Galli, a PhD student at IIT. \"The first flavor you get when you eat them is dark chocolate, followed by a surprising tangy kick, due to the edible electrolyte inside, which lasts a few seconds.\"\nAnd to their credit, these little chocolate wafer-like disks look fairly appetizing. The researchers are conscious of a potential aversion to ingesting electronic components, so have asked the question: What if eating these parts actually delivered a unique taste experience – and a good one at that?\n“Our challenge was to find the best way to showcase the innovations of our two partners, EPFL and IIT, by adding what we do best: indulgence,\" said Julien Boutonnet, a senior lecturer at Swiss hospitality school EHL and recipient of the Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF) award for pastry and candymaking. \"This is how the RoboCake was born, a true event pastry cake, meeting the challenge of combining technique, electronics, and taste.” \nThe cake is part of the four-year, €3.5-million (US$3.95-million) RoboFood Project, bringing together food scientists and robotics experts to make edible items that go beyond novelty. \n“Robotics and food are two separate worlds,” said Dario Floreano, head of LIS and RoboFood project coordinator. “However, merging them offers many advantages, particularly in terms of limiting electronic waste and food waste.” \nWhether the world is ready for \"intelligent food\" remains to be seen, but the researchers are exploring all kinds of applications beyond just taste.\nOther applications in the fields of emergency nutrition and health are being considered by scientists. And the technology is developing rapidly, as our [earlier coverage shows how far it's come](https://newatlas.com/robotics/edible-robot-components/) even in a short time. \n“Edible robots could be used to deliver food to endangered areas, to deliver medicines in innovative ways to people who have difficulty swallowing or to animals, or even to monitor food and its freshness using sensors that can be eaten,\" Floreano added. “This interdisciplinary collaboration paves the way for interactive and delicious gastronomic experiences reminding us that food is a precious resource and possibly reducing overeating.\"\nSoure: [EPFL](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/robotics-meets-the-culinary-arts/)\n[ View gallery - 10 images ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/robotic-cake/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Robotics](https://newatlas.com/robotics/)[Italian Institute of Technology](https://newatlas.com/tag/italian-institute-of-technology/)[Battery](https://newatlas.com/tag/battery/)[sustainable design](https://newatlas.com/tag/sustainable-design/)[Food technology](https://newatlas.com/tag/food+technology/)[Electronic](https://newatlas.com/tag/electronic/)[Smart](https://newatlas.com/tag/smart/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Robotic%20cake%20has%20batteries%20you%20can%20eat%20%E2%80%93%20and%20they%20even%20taste%20good&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Frobotics%2Frobotic-cake%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/robotic-cake/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\n[Bronwyn Thompson](https://newatlas.com/author/bronwyn-thompson/)\nBronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

Indeed, it isn't even based on wheels so will require a crane and truck to place it into position.\nIt has a length of 44 ft (13.4 m), making it just shy of the [largest tiny house we've seen](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/tellico-wind-river/), plus an increased width of 13 ft (3.9 m), helping it feel more like a normal home inside than a typical narrow tiny house. It's accessed through the deck and a glass door.\nThe living room is very light-filled thanks to its generous glazing and includes a sofa and an entertainment center, plus a second door that leads outside. The kitchen is nearby. This has a breakfast bar for three, an oven and stove, a fridge/freezer, microwave, a dishwasher, and quite a lot of cabinetry.\nThe bathroom is accessed from the kitchen and is actually a little more compact than expected, given the supersized nature of the dwelling. It features a flushing toilet, vanity sink, and a shower.\nThe Skyview 400's master bedroom, meanwhile, is situated on the opposite side of the home to the deck and has ample headroom to move around in, thanks to its position downstairs. It has some storage space, a stacked washer/dryer, and some closet space.\nThere is one loft in this model and it's reached by a staircase (this has no storage, however there is space beneath that could be used to store things). It has a low ceiling as you'd expect in a tiny house loft and it can be used for storage or as a second bedroom with a double bed. \nThe Skyview 400 is currently up for sale and starts at US$133,000.\nSource: [Irontown Modular](https://irontownmodular.com/skyview-400-park-model/)\n[ View gallery - 12 images ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/skyview-400-irontown-modular/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Tiny Houses](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/)[Micro-House](https://newatlas.com/tag/micro-housing/)[Tiny Footprint](https://newatlas.com/tag/tiny-footprint/)[Building and Construction](https://newatlas.com/tag/building+and+construction/)[House](https://newatlas.com/danish-mirror-house/21118/)[Home](https://newatlas.com/tag/home/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Plus-size%20tiny%20house%20offers%20spacious%20apartment-style%20living&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Ftiny-houses%2Fskyview-400-irontown-modular%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/tiny-houses/skyview-400-irontown-modular/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\n[Adam Williams](https://newatlas.com/author/adam-williams/)\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

It plans to offer a powerful personal hybrid-electric aircraft that will seat three people, deliver 510 miles (821 km) of range, and hit cruise speeds up of to 220 mph (354 km/h) – all while making 80% less noise than a helicopter.\nThose are some fighting words, especially when you consider that these figures are higher than what most other eVTOL makers have claimed so far – and the fact that all AltoVolo has to show at the moment is 3D renders of its Sigma aircraft, albeit rather pretty ones.\nFor comparison, Archer Aviation's Midnight electric air taxi, which has [jumped through several regulatory hoops in the US](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/archer-plans-air-taxi-nyc-sf-la/) recently, tops out at 150 mph (241 km/h) and 100 miles on a charge. [Joby's hydrogen fuel cell demonstrator](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/joby-200mph-air-taxi-uk-virgin-atlantic/) is perhaps a closer competitor: it [pulled off a 523-mile (842-km) flight](https://newatlas.com/joby-hydrogen-evtol-range/) last year, and can hit a max speed of 200 mph (322 km/h).\nIt's worth noting that these flying machines are being built for different use cases, though. While Joby and Archer have their sights set on the air taxi market – meaning rapid back-to-back flights and quick recharges in between – AltoVolo's Sigma could rival private helicopters that operate in residential areas with its range and quiet operation.\nThe Sigma is an undoubtedly bold vision, from the design to its dimensions. AltoVolo says it will measure just 15.7 ft (4.8 m) wide (about the same as a double garage door), feature a 1,608-hp powertrain capable of operating even when one jet fails, and weigh just 2,160 lb (980 kg) inclusive of three passengers, or about the same as [the incredibly fast Gordon Murray T.50 hypercar](https://newatlas.com/automotive/gordon-murray-t-50-supercar-aerodynamics/). That's all kinds of bonkers.\nAltoVolo says it's \"combined a patent-pending tilting electric jet design and integrated aerodynamics, to leverage the high burst capability of batteries for vertical take-off and landing, and the energy density of liquid fuel for long range flight.\"\nThat's all well and good, but as we've learned from covering eVTOL companies over the last few years, [getting such projects off the ground is not easy](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/lilium-200-million-reprieve/) by any measure. So while AltoVolo says it's had its design and engineering [validated by an experienced aerospace engineer](https://sophrodyne-aerospace.com/about_us/) and integrated autonomous flight tech from [veteran control systems firm Embention](https://www.embention.com/), I couldn't find much about its founder Will Wood's background online. So the proof will mostly be in the pudding.\nAltoVolo says it's done with prototype flight testing, and is gearing up to build a full-scale demonstrator next. It will open up a waitlist this July for early orders of its Sigma 'vertical hybrid jet.' I'm all for ambitious ventures like this, so I'll follow the company's journey to see how it progresses; stay tuned for more of our coverage of this private eVTOL.\nSource: [AltoVolo](https://www.altovolo.com/)\n[ View gallery - 5 images ](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/altovolo-hybrid-evtol-500-miles/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Aircraft](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/)[eVTOL](https://newatlas.com/tag/evtol/)[Personal eVTOLs](https://newatlas.com/tag/personal-evtols/)[Flying Machine](https://newatlas.com/tag/flying-machine/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=1%2C600-hp%20three-seat%20eVTOL%20promises%20jet-setters%20500%20miles%20at%20220%20mph&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Faircraft%2Faltovolo-hybrid-evtol-500-miles%2F)\n\n\n[ 19 comments ](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/altovolo-hybrid-evtol-500-miles/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\n[Abhimanyu Ghoshal](https://newatlas.com/author/abhimanyu-ghoshal/)\nAbhimanyu has been a trusted voice in the science, technology, transport innovations, startup and AI spaces for more than a decade at several global outlets, including three and a half years as the managing editor at TNW.

The brand has released a number of model lineups since, including commuters, folders and even a trike.\nThe RadRunner series [launched in 2019](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/radrunner-ebike-rad-power-bikes/) as a compact cargo hauler with a low-step frame, carrying capacity of 300 lb, a hub motor and a 45-mile battery. The following year added the [Plus](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/radrunner-plus-ebike/) to the lineup, a higher-end version of the standard bike. Both of these models have been updated for 2025, along with a reworking of 2023's [3 Plus flagship](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/radrunner-3-plus-ebike/) that sees it get a speed boost and a new name.\nThe RadRunner Max still features a 750-W rear-hub motor to assist pedal power, but moves into the Class 3 ebike space thanks to a top PAS speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) – though the rider can opt to dial that down to a steady 20 mph to meet local regulations.\nFive motor-assist PAS levels are available via a responsive RideLogic-tuned torque sensor, or the motor can be disabled to roll as a rather heavy unpowered bike. Torque tops out at 90 Nm (66 lb.ft), a half-twist throttle is included for pedal-free action, and the chain drive includes an 8-speed Shimano gearset for flexible ride options.\nLike all of the refreshed models, the Max benefits from Rad's [Safe Shield semi-integrated battery](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/rad-power-bikes-safe-shield-battery-radster/) – where the cells are enclosed in heat-absorbing resin to protect against corrosion and overheating. The 672-Wh battery pack here is reckoned good for up to 65 miles (105 km) at the lowest assist level, though an optional US$249 range extender could bump that to more than 125 miles.\nThe sturdy aluminum low-step frame has a maximum payload capacity of 420 lb (190 kg), with the rear rack rated for 120 lb (54 kg). There are mount points for an optional front rack/basket as well, together with bosses for a bottle cage.\nA suspension fork offers 80 mm of terrain-soaking travel, and works with 20-inch rims wrapped in 3.5-inch tires for a smooth ride in the city and beyond. A dual-leg kickstand should help with parking stability. And a low/high-beam headlight with ambient light sensing is onboard, along with a rear light with turn signaling.\nThat rear lighting unit also features a built-in radar to warn of vehicles approaching from up to 330 ft (100 m) away, while also flashing the light to make sure you're seen. The bike's display shows speed and distance data too, so you can gauge the danger that lurks behind. The Max works with Apple's FindMy network too, helping the rider locate the bike using a smartphone.\nThe RadRunner Max is up for pre-order now at $2,249 – shipping starts early May.\nThe new RadRunner Plus is similar to, but not as capable as, the Max. It also features a 750-watt hub motor, but rides as a Class 2 ebike with PAS cutting out at 20 mph. It's less torquey too, at 70 Nm, and its Safe Shield battery gets 55+ miles per charge – while the optional range extender boosts that to around 120 miles.\nIt lacks torque sensing, radar detection and location tracking, but does ship with a suspension fork, as well as a passenger seat and retractable footpegs, plus a protective wheel skirt. This model is on sale now for $1,799.\nThe base model RadRunner rides out with all the features of the Plus version, minus the suspension fork and range extender compatibility. It's also available now for $1,499.\nMeet the New RadRunners | Electric Cargo Bikes | Rad Power Bikes\nProduct pages: [RadRunner](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-electric-cargo-utility-bike), [RadRunner Plus](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-plus-electric-cargo-utility-bike), [RadRunner Max](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-max-electric-cargo-utility-bike)\n[ View gallery - 6 images ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/radrunner-plus-max-2025-refresh/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Bicycles](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/)[ebikes](https://newatlas.com/tag/ebikes/)[Pedal-assisted](https://newatlas.com/tag/pedal-assisted/)[cargo bike](https://newatlas.com/tag/cargo-bike/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=28-mph%20Rad%20utility%20ebike%20hauls%20420%20lb%20for%20more%20than%2060%20miles&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fbicycles%2Fradrunner-plus-max-2025-refresh%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/bicycles/radrunner-plus-max-2025-refresh/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-ridden/)\n[Paul Ridden](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-ridden/)\nWhile Paul is loath to reveal his age, he will admit to cutting his IT teeth on a TRS-80 (although he won't say which version).

Its eye-grabbing trailers pair retro-inspired color and quirk with unprecedented levels of modular living flexibility. But those two puzzle pieces don't always fit neatly together, at least not for every buyer. \nThose shopping for a simple, permanent RV floor plan might not be won over by the idea of building and rearranging things like Legos. Happier has responded by mixing more permanent fixtures into its otherwise modular floor plans, and the new Traveler Summit trailer is the next step forward in that direction. \nHappier dropped its debut [HC1 camper](https://newatlas.com/happier-camper-hc1-travel-trailer/37458/) back in 2015 as something of a rolling dichotomy. It caught attention from the outside with a two-tone exterior inspired by vintage icons like the original VW camper bus and towable classics like the Scamp and Boler. What was notable inside, on the other hand, was what wasn't there – as little as an empty white chamber. \nThat's because the HC1's bare tile-like floor was built to work with Happier's Adaptiv functional modules. Each little building block could be secured in place to create beds, benches and even kitchen areas. Some had functions, such as a toilet or sink, and some were simple structural blocks with interior storage. \nIt was a cool, little system, particularly if you wanted a trailer that could be rearranged from cozy micro-home to open toy hauler. At a base price just under $14,000, mixing and matching modules into your own floor plan seemed fun, feasible and extra-functional. \nOnce Happier pushed upmarket to a larger trailer model, it added a couple of fixed amenities. It's not as fun or whimsical to have a portable toilet box stuck to your living room floor when dropping $40,000 on a new camping trailer with plenty of interior space. Give it a proper private bathroom, and a kitchen while you're at it. \nHappier did just that when it launched the [17-foot (5.2-m) Traveler](https://newatlas.com/happier-traveler-camping-trailer/) in 2020, and it's been slowly exploring additional ways of mixing and matching its signature Adaptiv modularity with higher-end permanent amenities ever since, including adding an [available wet bathroom and kitchen](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/happier-camper-studio-camping-trailer/) to the smaller 13-foot (4-m) HC1. \nThe new Traveler Summit floor plan pushes the bar a little higher with new features above and beyond previous Happier launches. It becomes Happier's de facto flagship camper in the process. borrowing its full kitchenette and bathroom from the mid-level Traveler Adventure and adding in a console with tall door fridge/freezer and microwave for a more complete kitchen space. On the side of the console unit, a closet with rounded door offers space for clothes, towels, games, supplies, and whatever else you want to stuff in. \nThe Summit sleeps up to four people on beds that piece together from Adaptiv blocks topped with cushions. The front bed is a twin, the rear bed a full-size. An upper front bunk bed is available optionally to complete the sleeping arrangements. \nAt this point, it seems like Happier might just need to create a model with a regular floor plan and no Adaptiv modular components at all. Or maybe it could just shuffle the furnishings around a bit. The Summit's 50/50 modular/fixed split feels quite cramped and a little awkward. \nYou have a nice wet bathroom and aisle-spanning kitchen but two small beds made out of cushioned blocks and a dinette bench pushed up against the closet wall, with a door that opens right over top the seat. That might be okay on a $20K-something trailer, but for $70K, count us out. We prefer what Happier did with the HC1, pushing the permanent rooms and fixtures to the front while using the rear exclusively for the modular dining lounge/bedding – appears more natural and less cluttered. \nBut we guess stackable modularity has been a cornerstone of all Happier's designs, and the company is clearly loath to leave it behind all together, even if just on one trailer model. \nOther onboard Summit features include a new wireless charging dock, a furnace/water heater, a dry-flush toilet, an electrical system with solar panel and inverter, choice of dual-burner gas stove or induction cooktop, and a 64-L fresh water tank. The new trailer weighs in at 2,800 lb (1,270 kg) dry. \nThe Traveler Summit starts at $69,950 and Happier Camper is taking orders now for Fall 2025 (Northern Hemisphere). Options include air conditioning and the aforementioned bunk bed. \nSource: [Happier Camper](https://happiercamper.com/pages/hct)\n[ View gallery - 15 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/happier-camper-traveler-summit-trailer/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[Caravan](https://newatlas.com/tag/caravan/)[Trailer](https://newatlas.com/tag/trailer/)[trailers](https://newatlas.com/tag/trailers/)[Retro](https://newatlas.com/tag/retro/)[happier-camper](https://newatlas.com/tag/happier-camper/)[Outdoors and Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/)[Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/)[RV](https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Deliciously%20retro%20camping%20trailer%20smashes%20Legos%20into%20more%20permanent%20RV&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fhappier-camper-traveler-summit-trailer%2F)\n\n\n[ 1 comment ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/happier-camper-traveler-summit-trailer/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/c-c-weiss/)\n[C.C.

For certain tasks – such as coding or pawing through documents – an E Ink monitor might be a better fit. Boox has launched a 25.3-inch color E Ink display with super-refresh tech called the Mira Pro.\nBoox unveiled a [monochrome E Ink Mira Pro](https://shop.boox.com/blogs/news/mira-pro-frontlight-version) at around the same time that Dasung was [hitting Indiegogo](https://newatlas.com/technology/dasung-paperlike-color-e-ink-desktop-monitor/) with an equally proportioned color model. The latter brand [updated the production model](https://newatlas.com/technology/dasung-33hz-paperlike-color/) last year, and now Boox has crashed the party with its own color E Ink monitor.\nThe Mira Pro (Color Version) 25.3-inch monitor features Kaleido 3 color E Ink that offers 16 grayscale levels and 4,096 onscreen colors. Display resolution is reported to be 3,200 x 1,800 pixels (145 ppi), which seems on the high side for this flavor of color E Ink.\nThat's obviously not going to match the billion-plus vivid colors available on many backlit LCD panels, but E Ink doesn't use backlighting – it employs adjustable front lights that are considered much kinder to a user's eyes.\nOf course, if there's adequate ambient light in the office then users may not need to switch on the dual-tone illuminations at all. As for the rather low color palette, Boox says that the mellow colors on offer here make \"it ideal for tasks that require color differentiation such as reviewing color-coded dashboards, analyzing data, or working with complex graphics – perfect for professional workspaces and immersive learning.\"\nE Ink on its own can be a bit laggy so Boox has included its super refresh technology in the mix \"to enhance refresh rates and image quality while minimizing ghosting.\" There are four modes available – normal, text, video and slideshow – for choosing the best option for different tasks. If the presets aren't precise enough, users can tweak the refresh speed, dark color enhancement and light color filter to suit preferences.\nIf remnants of a previous screen's content do get past the automated check points and haunt the current view, a physical button on the side of the monitor will initiate a manual refresh. There's also a scroll wheel and a function button along the same edge.\nThe monitor offers connectivity to a computer, tablet or smartphone over HDMI, mini-HDMI, USB-C, and DisplayPort. It sits on a stylish aluminum stand that supports landscape or portrait orientation, and there's a VESA interface for mounting. Dual speakers provide audio when you need it.\nThe Boox Mira Pro (Color Version) isn't cheap, coming in at US$1,899.99, and ships direct from China so may be subject to import tariffs. This makes it a pricier option than Dasung's Paperlike Color. And both are much more expensive than regular backlit computer monitors.\nProduct page: [Mira Pro (Color Version)](https://shop.boox.com/products/mira)\n[ View gallery - 4 images ](https://newatlas.com/technology/boox-mira-pro-color-e-ink-monitor/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Technology](https://newatlas.com/technology/)[E-Ink](https://newatlas.com/tag/e-ink/)[Monitor](https://newatlas.com/tag/monitor/)[Display](https://newatlas.com/tag/display/)[Colors](https://newatlas.com/tag/colors/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Color%20E%20Ink%20monitor%20is%20kinder%20to%20the%20eyes%20of%20productive%20pros&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Ftechnology%2Fboox-mira-pro-color-e-ink-monitor%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/technology/boox-mira-pro-color-e-ink-monitor/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-ridden/)\n[Paul Ridden](https://newatlas.com/author/paul-ridden/)\nWhile Paul is loath to reveal his age, he will admit to cutting his IT teeth on a TRS-80 (although he won't say which version).

Under current plans, that would mean a rendezvous with multiple rockets ferrying fuel from Earth to tank up the Mars ship for the year-long journey to the Red Planet.\nHowever, things are different now. Instead of tankers, small, black, polygonal modules leave a stick-like space station. They dock with the stern of the Mars ship and, once in position, their exhausts glow blue, then violet as the ship accelerates faster and faster, the self-contained nuclear fusion engines burning longer and with more power than anything seen before as the ship slips into a transfer orbit that will see it reach Mars in record time.\nScience fiction? Maybe not.\nFounded in 2013, [Pulsar Fusion](https://newatlas.com/space/nuclear-pulsar-fusion-test-green-hybrid-rocket/) has been on our radar for sometime and it's been the cause of much head scratching at New Atlas editorial meetings. On the one hand, it seemed to be a very serious company producing a solid line of electric space propulsion systems as well as a hybrid liquid/solid rocket engine and space-based nuclear fission reactors, along with getting some serious development money from the British government. On the other hand, it was also making noises about a nuclear engine project that sounded so crazy that it seemed like it had to be vaporware put out for publicity.\nCalled Sunbird, we now have more details on the nuclear fusion rocket project that is so far along that the company expects to demonstrate it later this year and begin orbital tests in 2027.\nWhat made Sunbird seem impossible when we first heard about it was that it was based on a fusion rocket engine. If anyone has followed the attempts to build practical commercial fusion reactors, they'll be aware that the goal is right where it was back in the 1950s – always 20 years in the future. If that's the case, how could Pulsar Fusion be claiming to be building something that would make SpaceX's Starship look like a horse-drawn [Zeppelin](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/flying-whales-5000-hp-airship/)?\nSunbird 1\nAccording to Richard Dinan, CEO of Pulsar Fusion, the answer is that Sunbird uses a completely different kind of fusion to what you find in a tokamak reactor – one with a completely different purpose in a completely different environment where weaknesses become strengths\nIn a [tokamak](https://newatlas.com/energy/tokamak-energy-temperature-threshold-commercial-fusion/) reactor, fusion is based on Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) or Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) reactions, where the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium are subjected in confinement to immense pressures and temperatures until a reaction is set off that fuses the hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing energy and neutrons.\nSince a tokamak has to run continuously and the energy is collected as heat to generate steam to run a turbine, the reactor has to be built on a gargantuan scale with giant magnetic coils, cryogenic coolant systems, heavily armored containment vessels, and lots of radiation shielding to deal with neutron erosion.\nOn the other hand, the Sunbird seems to have been designed in an absentminded fashion. Or rather, absentmindedness with a clear purpose in mind. Its fusion reactor works on the Dual [Direct Fusion Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Fusion_Drive) (DDFD) principle, which harkens back to an early fusion reactor design that's been long abandoned except for laboratory research.\nBasically, it's a linear reactor where, instead of going around in circles, there's a straight chamber with a pinched bit. It involves pulsed magnetic fields that accelerate plasma into the chamber, where the particles collide, producing fusion. It works, but it was rejected early on because it tends to leak at the ends.\nHowever, what a power engineer would regard as a flaw, a rocket engineer sees as a feature.\nIn the DDFD, this leakage is actually desired because it's used for thrust. In addition, there's no need for much of the tokamak gear because it isn't being used to generate heat, it doesn't need to sustain the reaction indefinitely, and it doesn't even need nearly as much shielding.\nThat's because Sunbird uses what is called aneutronic fusion. Instead of fusing deuterium and tritium to make helium and neutrons, Sunbird uses a mix of deuterium and helium-3. For the mathematically minded and the masochistic, that's expressed by the formula D+3He→4He(3.6MeV)+p+(14.7MeV). Translated, it means that the deuterium and helium-3 fuse to produce the stable isotope helium-4, lots of energy, and a proton. In practice, there are many fewer neutrons and a plasma that can be used for rocket thrust. The positive charge of the protons means that the [plasma](https://newatlas.com/space/pulsed-plasma-rocket-ppr-mars/) can be readily controlled.\nThat may sound a bit like the ion thrusters and variants used on today's deep space missions and ones that Pulsar Fusion builds, but there's a huge difference in scale, like comparing a Dyson ducted room fan to a Rolls-Royce Ultrafan jet engine.\nSunbird 2\nSunbird uses a converging pair of plasma streams confined by a proprietary technology that Pulsar Fusion really doesn't want to talk about. This is all a massive oversimplification based on incomplete knowledge, but the upshot is that, if Pulsar Fusion can get this to work, it has very serious implications for the future of space travel.\nThe biggest thing is that the Sunbird combines high thrust with high [specific impulse](https://newatlas.com/space/nuclear-thermal-propulsion-ntp-nasa-unsc-tech-deep-space-travel/), which is a measure of a rocket's efficiency. The higher the number, the greater the efficiency. For example, a chemical rocket can generate a million pounds of force, but its specific impulse, measured in how many seconds it takes to consume a unit of fuel, is only 500 seconds.\nThat means a lot of thrust but for only a short time. An electric propulsion system like an ion or Hall thruster has a specific impulse of up to 5,000 seconds but a thrust of only about the equivalent to the weight of a sheet or paper or a coin. Rockets using nuclear fission do better than chemical rockets with a specific impulse of up to 900 seconds, though the thrust on the experimental variants has only reached a mere 75,000 lb.\nOn the other hand, Sunbird is a bit startling – at least on paper. Its specific impulse is up to 15,000 seconds, which is three times that of ion drives. Thrust? Not so much on the current test visions at only 2.2 lb, but the theoretical limit is in the one million-pound range.\nLong story short: Sunbird combines very high efficiency with very high thrust. Oh, and that plasma blasting out of the engine can be passed through a magnetohydrodynamic coil to generate 2 MW of electricity. That's pretty good, considering that the most powerful system is currently the solar array on the International Space Station (ISS) that manages 120 kW.\nThe Sunbird Migratory Transfer Vehicle, as the complete package is called, is a modular system that's designed to act as a tug rather than an integrated rocket engine that's part of a spacecraft. It's designed to be stationed in orbit on a refueling [mothership](https://newatlas.com/marine/china-autonomous-mothership/). As needed, it can dock in groups with another craft and act like a sort of super high-tech cosmic outboard motor. With its greater thrust and efficiency, it could reduce the travel time to Mars to as little as three months and to Pluto to just four years.\nSunbird could also potentially propel much larger payloads and provide them with undreamed of energy levels for long-duration missions into deep space. Not to mention that each Sunbird is reusable and can be stationed not just in Earth orbit, but around the Moon and other planets as required.\nThe technology is currently under development by Pulsar Fusion using vacuum test chambers that are the size of a double-decker bus. Earthside demonstrations of Sunbird are expected this year with in-orbit tests of key components in 2027.\n\"I expect that, as of today, Sunbird is already being closely analyzed by our global competitors,\" said Dinan. \"Pulsar has built a reputation for delivering real technology – not just concepts. We have recently commissioned not one, but two of the largest space propulsion testing chambers in the UK, if not all of Europe. Pulsar is now an international space propulsion testing powerhouse, and we have ambitious plans to expand rapidly. We actively welcome visits from appropriate partners and prospective international clients and look forward to sharing more exciting developments we have in the pipeline.\"\nSource: [Pulsar Fusion](https://pulsarfusion.com/products-development/sunbird-fusion-propulsion/)\n[ View gallery - 3 images ](https://newatlas.com/space/pulsar-fusion-rocket-design-slash-space-travel-times/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Space](https://newatlas.com/space/)[Nuclear Fusion](https://newatlas.com/tag/fusion/)[Nuclear Rocket](https://newatlas.com/tag/nuclear-rocket/)[Rocket](https://newatlas.com/tag/rocket/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=New%20fusion%20rocket%20design%20could%20cut%20Mars%20trip%20to%20under%204%20months&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fspace%2Fpulsar-fusion-rocket-design-slash-space-travel-times%2F)\n\n\n[ 8 comments ](https://newatlas.com/space/pulsar-fusion-rocket-design-slash-space-travel-times/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\n[David Szondy](https://newatlas.com/author/david-szondy/)\nDavid Szondy is a playwright, author and journalist based in Seattle, Washington.

Each year, lightning claims hundreds of millions of trees worldwide, leaving behind scorched trunks and shattered branches. Yet, in an intriguing twist of nature, some tropical trees have turned this destructive force of nature to their advantage.\nA recent study reports that the tropical almond tree _Dipteryx oleifera_ (also known as almendro), not only survives direct lightning strikes but thrives because of them. Researchers discovered that a lightning strike damages the surrounding trees that directly compete for resources and also blasts away lianas, those woody parasitic vines known to strangle and reduce the growth of many rainforest trees.\nResearchers long suspected some tree species had tolerance towards lightning, but no empirical evidence existed to back up this hypothesis. The team of researchers, led by Evan Gora, deployed a lightning location system across Barro Colorado Nature Monument in central Panama to track the after-effects on 93 trees struck by lightning.\nOver six years, scientists paid special attention to nine _D. oleifera_ trees that were zapped. Remarkably, every single tree survived with only minor damage. In contrast, all other trees subjected to a direct hit were severely damaged, and nearly two-thirds died within two years of the strike.\n“Seeing that there are trees that get struck by lightning and they’re fine was just mind blowing,” says Gora.\nOn average, a single lightning strike cleared out 9.2 neighboring trees as the current passed along via vines and adjoining branches. Additionally, the liana infestation on _D. oleifera_ decreased by 78%. With less competition for sunlight, space, and nutrients, these trees increased their fecundity (ability to produce offspring) by 14 times.\nThat competitive advantage shows up in the canopy: drone-generated 3D canopy mapping revealed the lightning-struck almendros stood about 4 m (13 ft) taller than their unstruck neighbors. With this towering trait, _D. oleifera_ turned out 68% more likely to be struck than other trees, acting as a natural lightning rod. Since _D. oleifera_ trees can live for hundreds of years, they are expected to withstand multiple strikes throughout their lives.\n“It's better off for a _Dipteryx oleifera_ tree to be struck than not,” says Gora.\nIn evolutionary terms, _D. oleifera_ has employed a very unusual survival mechanism. It appears warding off rivals and parasites at the cost of minor visible injury is a winning strategy.\nThe study was published in [_New Phytologist_](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.70062).\nSource: [Cary Institute](https://www.caryinstitute.org/news-insights/press-release/getting-hit-lightning-good-some-tropical-trees)\n## Tags\n[Environment](https://newatlas.com/environment/)[Tree](https://newatlas.com/tag/tree/)[Lightning](https://newatlas.com/tag/lightning/)[Weather](https://newatlas.com/tag/weather/)[Geology](https://newatlas.com/tag/geology/)[Ecosystem](https://newatlas.com/tag/ecosystem/)[Evolution](https://newatlas.com/tag/evolution/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Nature%E2%80%99s%20shock%20therapy%3A%20How%20lightning%20strikes%20help%20this%20tropical%20tree&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fenvironment%2Ftropical-tree-benefits-struck-by-lightning%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/environment/tropical-tree-benefits-struck-by-lightning/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/jay-kakade/)\n[Jay Kakade](https://newatlas.com/author/jay-kakade/)\nJay is a freelance science writer, focused on the intersection of technological advancements, gadgets, and scientific discoveries.

That's where the multi-terrain LEVA bot comes in, as it can autonomously lift and drop off cargo boxes weighing up to 85 kg.\nCurrently in functional prototype form, LEVA is being developed by a team of engineers and designers from Switzerland's ETH Zurich university, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, and Zurich University of the Arts.\nETH spinoff company RIVR (formerly Swiss-Mile) already manufactures the RIVR ONE (formerly [ANYmal](https://newatlas.com/robotics/anymal-swiss-mile-quadruped-wheeled-standing-robot/)) quadruped robot, which certainly _could_ be used for deliveries in urban settings. Like RIVR ONE, LEVA has four jointed legs, each one with a motorized wheel at the end instead of a foot.\nThis design allows the robot to quickly and energy-efficiently zip across smooth surfaces such as sidewalks, simply by rolling on its wheels like a car. It utilizes a combination of GPS, LiDAR sensors and cameras to autonomously navigate city streets and avoid obstacles.\nWhen the bot needs to climb stairs or step over curbs, it locks up its wheels and then walks/climbs like a dog or other four-legged animal. It can also use this functionality to traverse rough terrain that isn't conducive to rolling.\nThe big thing that sets LEVA _apart_ from RIVR ONE is its ability to autonomously spot, make its way over to, then lift and carry [Euro-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container) cargo boxes weighing as much as 85 kg (187 lb).\nThis process is partially made possible by five onboard cameras – one on each vertical side of the robot's rectangular(ish) body, and one on the underside. Additionally, because each of the wheels is independently steerable, the omnidirectional bot can roll straight to the left or right as needed.\nOnce LEVA has positioned itself directly over the box, it bends its legs to lower its body downwards. Internal powered hooks then latch onto the top of the box, securing it beneath the bot's body. The robot then just rises back up and heads for its destination.\nIt's hard to say how soon it might be before you see a LEVA on a street near you, as the scientists are still perfecting the bot's real-world functionality. In the meantime, you can see it in box-toting, stair-climbing, ground-rolling action, in the video below.\nLEVA: A high-mobility logistic vehicle with legged suspension\nSource: [LEVA](https://leva.ethz.ch/)\n[ View gallery - 6 images ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/leva-legged-wheeled-delivery-robot/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Robotics](https://newatlas.com/robotics/)[Delivery robots](https://newatlas.com/tag/delivery-robots/)[Quadruped](https://newatlas.com/tag/quadruped/)[ETH Zurich](https://newatlas.com/tag/eth-zurich/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Clever%20cargo%20robot%20uses%20legs%20and%20wheels%20to%20tote%20boxes%20without%20human%20help&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Frobotics%2Fleva-legged-wheeled-delivery-robot%2F)\n\n\n[ 4 comments ](https://newatlas.com/robotics/leva-legged-wheeled-delivery-robot/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\n[Ben Coxworth](https://newatlas.com/author/ben-coxworth/)\nBased out of Edmonton, Canada, Ben Coxworth has been writing for New Atlas since 2009 and is presently Managing Editor for North America.

The Italian carmaker has a waiting list that extends until 2026. That hasn’t stopped it from working on its very first electric car, slated for release later this year.\nBut apparently, there’s more to come. Industry-wide rumors have long suggested that Ferrari might have its sights set on bringing back the manual transmission in its cars, after a 13-year gap.\nThis has now been confirmed, as the brand's chief product development officer, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, told [_Carsales_](https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/ferrari-to-revive-gated-manual-149101/) that Ferrari is now ready to entertain ideas about bringing the gated manual gearbox back, but only for cars that are deemed suitable.\n\"In terms of mechanical gear changes, it’s something that could be in the future, depending on the product,\" said Fulgenzi. When asked which cars in Ferrari's stable could be resurrected with manual transmissions, he responded, \"Probably an Icona car, because it’s a car that represents our heritage, a car to be admired and to be driven in a certain way.\"\nHe went on to state that the Iconas' performance would be constrained in comparison to other Prancing Horse supercars and hypercars, because the maximum torque levels would necessitate a \"very big leg\" in order to handle the heavy clutch.\nThat’s interesting, considering Icona cars, such as the Daytona SP3 and [Monza SP1/SP2](https://newatlas.com/ferrari-monza-sp1-sp2/56386/), are designed for emotional connection rather than performance specifications. In the past, Ferrari continuously disregarded manual gearboxes because they impair overall performance; nevertheless, it looks like the company may be open to making an exception.\nThe [California](https://newatlas.com/new-ferrari-california/9328/), which was discontinued in 2012, was the last Ferrari to have a manual gearbox. Since then, the brand's staple has been dual-clutch automatics, boosted by improvements in efficiency and performance. Nonetheless, those (like me) who still prefer a driving connection to pure acceleration continue to prefer the tactile feel of a traditional gearbox.\nFulgenzi discovered that manual Ferraris are not just sought after by sentimental collectors. It appears that prominent individuals like seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton have also voiced support for a return to manual transmissions. According to some reports, Hamilton is eager for a modern-day tribute to the legendary [Ferrari F40](https://newatlas.com/mini-ferrari-f40-25000/14613/), which he hopes would be called the F44, perhaps in homage to his racing number.\nFerrari's current crop of cars, such as the [SF90 XX](https://newatlas.com/ferrari-sf90-hybrid-stradale/59910/), can reach 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.4 seconds, which is extremely close to Formula One standards. Increasing performance may also prove needless and physically exhausting for regular drivers, as Fulgenzi stated.\nHe did, however, state that \"all engineering of the car must be enhanced in driving traits.\" In the post-peak-performance era, Ferrari emphasizes enjoyment behind the wheel to make sure customers are interested in driving their vehicle as much as possible.\nIt's safe to speculate that the great majority of Ferrari's 13,000+ vehicles sold last year did not end up in the hands of fighter pilots or Formula One drivers. \"I don't think all of our customers want to have to train every morning just to drive our cars,\" noted Fulgenzi.\nSo, the next 10 years for the Italian carmaker are going to be more about driving connections and feel over performance numbers. So far, there’s no official timeline for the new manual models.\nVia: [Carsales](https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/ferrari-to-revive-gated-manual-149101/)\n[ View gallery - 5 images ](https://newatlas.com/automotive/ferrari-manual-transmission/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Automotive](https://newatlas.com/automotive/)[Ferrari](https://newatlas.com/tag/ferrari/)[Transmission](https://newatlas.com/tag/transmission/)[F1](https://newatlas.com/tag/f1/)[Supercars](https://newatlas.com/tag/supercars/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Ferrari%20hints%20at%20a%20return%20of%20the%20manual%20transmission&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Fautomotive%2Fferrari-manual-transmission%2F)\n\n\n[ 5 comments ](https://newatlas.com/automotive/ferrari-manual-transmission/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/utkarsh-sood/)\n[Utkarsh Sood](https://newatlas.com/author/utkarsh-sood/)\nWith an MBA, Utkarsh comes from a marketing background, where he honed his skills in social media, web design, advertising and copywriting.

The new magnesium-housed motor cranks torque and power to the top of the lineup and adds a new top speed \"race\" mode for getting fired up on all cylinders in a hurry. It might just inspire a new generation of fast, fully adrenalized electric mountain biking. \nBosch's new Performance Line CX-R drive picks up where the Performance Line CX leaves off, increasing peak power from a 600-W ceiling to a full 750 watts. Torque gets boosted from 85 to 100 Nm (74 lb-ft), while maximum assistance level rises to 400 percent, a target Bosch set with steep technical hills in mind.\nThe CX-R motor weighs in over 3 oz less than the standard CX at an even 6 lb (2.7 kg), thanks to its combination of powder-coated magnesium shell, corrosion-resistant titanium crank spindle, and ceramic ball bearings. \nThe new CX-R earns its \"R\" with an exclusive Race mode that directs full motor power into all-out lag-free acceleration, right up to top speed and/or 400% assistance level. Race mode also extends time on the integrated boost function that increases output to help the rider power over and through large obstacles, such as an oversized rock garden or tangled web of tall, slick tree roots. It promises to turn short hike-a-bike jaunts into just another part of the ride.\nA new eMTB+ mode essentially splits the difference between the existing range-optimizing eMTB mode and all-out Race assistance. It works to harness the new levels of power and torque more naturally into the riding curve, responding in line with changes in the rider's own power and cadence. A pair of integrated sensors measures pedal input 1,000 times per second to ensure immediate drive response the rider doesn't even notice beyond the overall smoother performance.\nRiders can also fine-tune Ride and eMTB+ settings in Bosch's eBike Flow app. To better illustrate how this works, one of Bosch's [latest videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33OTqXc0eFI) shows stuntman-level pro mountain biker Danny MacAskill dial torque and power up to maximum in order to navigate a particularly tight switchback. The extra oomph helps him muscle up a short, steep rock stack after coming to a virtual stop on a hop-turn. Increasing output on-demand helps in this case to grind through a short but difficult momentum-sapping stretch that would otherwise require hopping off and walking. It can then be dialed back to help extend battery life and range. \n\"The new eMTB+ riding mode brings the power of the CX-R to the trail in a controlled manner,\" explains Claus Fleischer, CEO of Bosch eBike Systems. \"Thanks to Dynamic Control – a type of traction control in the new mode – propulsion remains controlled even on demanding terrain, steep sections and wet surfaces.\"\nThe CX-R also comes with the new Kiox 400C, a top tube-integrated display that auto-adjusts to ambient light and also adjusts the data shown based on riding situation. For instance, a data set that includes elevation is displayed when pedaling uphill, switched to a speed-focused display on the way down. Of course, riders have the last say in what data they're looking at and can either adjust settings ahead of time in the eBike Flow app or on-the-fly with the physical buttons on the screen or handlebar remote. \nNo pricing just yet, as the CX-R mid-drive will come directly with OEM ebikes built around it. Bosch expects the first of those to hit the market in Fall 2025. We'll keep an eye out for the first CX-R bike debuts when Eurobike gets underway in late June for a better idea of how the boosted CX-R specs will affect numbers like range and battery life. \nGood news for current Performance Line CX owners, who need not seethe with envy: Bosch also announced this week that the latest Performance Line CX motor (BDU384Y) will be upgradable to the CX-R's 750-W/100-Nm/400% stat line via an OTA eBike Flow app update. It won't receive the CX-R-exclusive Race mode but will get the eBike+ mode. \nThe catch? The individual bike manufacturer has to approve the over-the-air update ahead of the July rollout. Each manufacturer serves as the final authority on specs and updates, but we can't imagine many eMTB builders falling behind the pack by not approving a performance boost that's sitting out there like sumptuous, low-dangling fruit. \nWe're generally big proponents of traditional non-electric pedaling, but watching videos like Bosch's CX-R promo always makes us want to give a few eMTBs a thorough long-term shakedown.\nPerformance Line CX-R | Extraordinary.

Count us in. It's the new Bote Hangout Water Hammock 15, and while it's far from the only water hammock out there floating lakes and bays, it's definitely bigger and badder than average, adding a few innovative features that make a laid-back day on the water that much more enjoyable.\nThe Hangout 15 stretches a namesake 15 feet (4.6 m) in diameter and has a weight capacity of 2,200 lb (1,000 kg). As a fun exercise, we'll take the [weight of the average American adult](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm) to be 185 lb (84 kg), which means you can squeeze in just shy of a dozen people without exceeding weight capacity. We'll call it a clean dozen because it seems likely there'll be at least a child or two in the mix to tug the total human payload down below 2,200. \nBote introduced the Hangout 15 this month as the new flagship of the Hangout Water Hammock family, which also includes 7- and 10-foot (2.1- and 3-m) models. The greater Hangout series ports over the company's rugged inflatable drop-stitch PVC construction from stand-up paddleboards to lifestyle lounge gear that includes swim platforms, tubes and various floating loungers.\nOf course, all the Hangout 15's size and capacity leads to some weight. At 75 lb (34 kg), it's not necessarily that daunting to carry with a person or two, but Bote makes it easier with a wheeled 36 x 24 x 14-in (91 x 61 x 36-cm) storage bag that rolls right to launch point. It then inflates to between 6 and 8 psi via hand pump or optional electric pump and provides a big, ol' on-water lounge for taking in sun and surf. Four included \"Docklink\" attachment rings let users attach multiple Hangouts or other floating together into a sprawling water-top day lounge. \nThe Hangout 15's full mesh center works as the actual hammock, allowing users to sit in the water without sinking like a stone. The floating ring with anti-slip surface works as a dock-like sun platform for sitting or lying out of the water in the open air. \nThe deck top also features one of the innovations that tie Bote's various products together: Magnepods. These magnetic docks are compatible with Bote tumblers, speakers and packs, holding them in place via a strong magnetic connection. So Hangout loungers can enjoy drinks and music without worrying about losing their kit in the water. \nAll in all, the Hangout Water Hammock 15 is one of those products that makes us a little disgruntled to be sitting indoors writing about it and not out in the sun enjoying it. It's still a bit early in the Northern Hemisphere spring season, though, so maybe we'll be in a better spot in a month or two. \nThe Hangout 15 is available now for a retail price of $1,799 and includes the wheeled travel bag, hand pump and a repair kit. If that seems like too much float or too much money, Bote's other Hangout Hammocks and loungers bring similar fun-in-sun revelry with less bulk and price, starting at $949 for the Hangout 7. \nVideo intro below:\nBOTE Hangout Water Hammock\nSource: [Bote](https://www.boteboard.com/collections/inflatable-docks/products/inflatable-hangout-water-hammock-15-classic)\n[ View gallery - 9 images ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/bote-15-ft-magnetic-h2o-hammock/#gallery:1)\n## Tags\n[Outdoors](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/)[Water Sports](https://newatlas.com/tag/water-sports/)[Hammocks](https://newatlas.com/tag/hammocks/)[Outdoors and Camping](https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/)[Marine Innovations](https://newatlas.com/tag/marine/)[Beach](https://newatlas.com/tag/beach/)[Boating](https://newatlas.com/tag/boating/)[Floating](https://newatlas.com/tag/floating/)\n  * [ Flipboard ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Floating%20hammock%20lets%20a%20dozen%20people%20lounge%20in%20sun-soaked%20waters&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Foutdoors%2Fbote-15-ft-magnetic-h2o-hammock%2F)\n\n\n[ 2 comments ](https://newatlas.com/outdoors/bote-15-ft-magnetic-h2o-hammock/#comments)\n[ ](https://newatlas.com/author/c-c-weiss/)\n[C.C.

And while there doesn't tend to be any food-preserving UV light in our refrigerators, a new consumer device is out to change that.\nCalled the EcoLoc, the gadget actually consists of two parts: a small battery-powered UV lamp module, and a clear glass food container lid with a cradle in which the module is placed. The lid is compatible with Ikea's existing line of 365+ food storage containers.\nAt the heart of the module is a special chip designed by scientists from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University and Swedish company PureFize Technologies. That chip produces short wave UV light – aka UVC, which is [the most effective type for killing germs](https://newatlas.com/uv-leds-fruit-mold-decay/27795/) – and it does so _without_ the use of toxic mercury, which is typically utilized in conventional UVC lamps.\nInstead, the chip takes advantage of a process known as cathodoluminescence.\nPutting it simply(ish), this involves passing electrons from a zinc-oxide cathode, through an electric field which accelerates them, and onto a cathode. That cathode is coated in a material that emits mainly UVC light – along with some UVA and UVB – when excited by the electrons.\nAnd no, the EcoLoc isn't intended to be switched on continuously. The general idea is that it initially gets switched on for a few minutes when the food is first placed in the container – an integrated timer automatically shuts it off.

He was mapping how information travels on Twitter when he stumbled onto a few clusters of accounts that looked a little suspicious. Some of them shared the same post thousands of times. Others reshared thousands of posts from each account. “These are not human,” he remembers thinking.\nSo began an extensive career in bot watching. As a distinguished professor of informatics at Indiana University at Bloomington, Menczer has studied the way bots proliferate, manipulate human beings and turn them against one another. In 2014 he was part of a team that developed the tool [BotOrNot](https://iuni.iu.edu/projects/botometer \"BotOrNot\") to help people spot fake accounts in the wild.

    "content": "May 9, 2025 at 4:00 PM UTC\nSponsored\nSponsored\nShare \nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. \nNeobanks improved convenience, but true financial freedom requires transparency, control, and autonomy, deobanks like WeFi are making it a reality.\nTable of Contents\nAt some point, most of us have excitedly downloaded the latest fintech app, lured in by its promises of seamless transactions, effortless budgeting, and a slicker financial experience. Clean and modern interfaces make onboarding a breeze, while the debit card arrives in cool, photogenic packaging that makes users feel special.\nBut, what has actually changed? Once the initial excitement fades, we realize it’s the same engine, the same infrastructure, just a pretty new face to interact with. That means the same limitations, opaque rules, and lack of control are still in place. Of course, things are faster and the upgrade is more convenient and usable, but access and financial freedom are not the same thing. A nicer interface doesn’t mean more autonomy. Until now. \nThe concept of a deobank is one where users can have their cake and eat it. People get beautiful interfaces and revolutionary features, as well as full control of their finances and complete transparency over their funds. That requires more than just a sleek and minimalist new card arriving in the mail, users need to leverage decentralized technologies, transparent-by-design tooling, and user-centric platforms built on the values of blockchain technology.\n## What financial freedom really means\nLet’s reflect on what “financial freedom” actually means (hint: it’s more than just having a certain amount of money in the bank). It’s really about:\n  * **Having full control over funds:** Only users can decide how their money is used, with no limits, no freezes, and no need to ask permission or justify a withdrawal. They’re the user’s assets, always accessible. \n  * **Having confidence and transparency:** Users should be able to see how their bank manages its assets (user funds), understand every fee being charged, and know that every transaction is recorded immutably on a public ledger. With transparency comes confidence, not blind trust.\n  * **Having full flexibility:** Financial freedom is having the tools to save, send, spend, or grow money without restrictions. Users can invest in emerging DeFi protocols, earn a competitive yield, or get a loan, whenever they like, with no barriers.\n\n\nTraditional banks and neobanks don’t offer this level of control, and likely wouldn’t, even if they knew how to. Instead, they improve their apps and make nicer looking cards. Truthfully speaking, a fresh coat of paint and sleek aesthetics does absolutely nothing for financial autonomy. To do that, we need to overcome certain limitations.\n## The limits of Neobanks\nIt’s hard to argue that neobanks haven’t disrupted banking with their user-friendly UI and reduced fees, but when we look closer, they’re hardly different from their traditional banking predecessors. It’s now a critical task for new and innovative fintech platforms to help take the industry into a new era.\nConsider these key limitations:\n  * **Legacy banking rails:** Most neobanks are dependent on traditional banking rails for payment processing, regulatory compliance, and infrastructure. They’re subject to the same inefficiencies, delays, and restrictions.\n  * **Subject to centralization:** Neobanks may have improved the user experience, but they’re still controlled centrally, meaning they can freeze accounts, place arbitrary limits, charge whatever fees they deem fit, and make decisions about the users’ funds. If they can do that, users don’t truly own their “banked” assets. Centralization also exposes users to hacking risks, regulatory intervention, and fund mismanagement.\n\n\nUsers are essentially renting their financial freedom, not owning it. Is a smoother app worth the trade-off, or are people willing to explore new fintech developments to get a much better experience and autonomy?\nYou might also like:  [ Stablecoins can hold central banks fiscally accountable | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/web-stories/stablecoins-can-hold-central-banks-accountable/)\n## What makes a Deobank different\n[Deobanks](https://www.wefi.co/post/deobank-the-next-gen-digital-banking-solution) are the next step forward for banking, and how we think about banking. They are blockchain-native, decentralized platforms designed to empower users with real financial freedom via a transparent, secure, and accessible financial system. \nHere’s what defines a deobank:\n  * **Non-custodial or hybrid accounts:** In a non-custodial model, users hold the private keys to their digital assets, with nobody else having any power or control over them. Alternatively, hybrid models offer more balance, providing custodial options to those who want them, but with self-custody prioritized.\n  * **On-chain transparency:** Everything that happens within a deobank is recorded immutably, on a public blockchain, for anyone to verify and track. No more black box activity, banking mysteries, or “misappropriated funds”.\n  * **Stablecoins:** Deobanks understand that cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, like the US dollar, enable seamless, global financial access. These stablecoins, like USDC and USDT, eliminate the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies and make for cheaper, faster, and borderless transactions.\n  * **DeFi integrations:**[Decentralized finance](https://crypto.news/defi-needs-a-dose-of-paranoia-about-risk-management/) offers thousands of new tools with incredible opportunities, such as lending protocols, yield farming platforms, and other financial products typically hard to access with traditional banks. \n\n\nRight now, only deobanks like [WeFi](http://www.wefi.co) are pursuing this kind of freedom, flexibility, and control for their users, who they see as participants, not customers. \nMaksym Sakharov, WeFi’s Group CEO and Co-founder discusses what problems deobanks must solve that neobanks and traditional banks still struggle with, especially when it comes to user autonomy and transparency. He explains that deobanks address the fundamental issue of centralized control inherent in traditional banking systems. With WeFi, users get unparalleled autonomy over their assets, eliminating the risk of arbitrary account freezes or restrictions.\n## How WeFi delivers real financial freedom\nWeFi is leading a revolution in banking, embodying the deobank model to redesign the system in favor of the users. They plan to achieve this by leveraging decentralized technologies and ideals to deliver full transparency and user empowerment.\nKey features designed to achieve the deobank dream:\n  * **Smart contract-based accounts:** WeFi accounts are built on smart contracts. This requires users to connect with their own blockchain wallets, but allows them full control over their funds and eliminates intermediaries.\n  * **Full transparency:** Every transaction and operation on WeFi is recorded on the blockchain for full auditability, so that users no longer have to ask “what is happening to my funds”. The system’s integrity is verified at all times.\n  * **Real-time access:** WeFi provides users with immediate access to a range of tools, like high-yield savings accounts, near-instant payment solutions, and lending or borrowing opportunities. Users are empowered and encouraged to manage their finances more actively.\n  * **Optional custody:** Some users may want full control, while others may opt for WeFi’s support with security and account protection. \n\n\nWeFi knows that they have to go further than just convenience, but what does the platform believe makes the deobank approach unique in empowering users with true financial control?\nHead of Growth, Agne Linge, shared that WeFi’s unique approach lies in its seamless integration of DeFi principles, tools, and opportunities into a sleek UI, offering non-custodial options and transparent on-chain operations, and empowering users to retain complete control over their assets.\n## Rethinking what financial freedom really takes\nA cool debit card and funky UI are not financial freedom, they are just convenience. They don’t shift the power dynamic, improve ownership, access, or transparency. Only deobanks like WeFi are working on pushing for that change.\nNow, it’s time to consider a new type of system that works for all users, for financial freedom, for autonomy, and for a new era of financial empowerment. New possibilities, opportunities, and options await. \nRead more:  [ Blockchain technology is the key to grassroots financial freedom | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/blockchain-technology-is-the-key-to-grassroots-financial-freedom-opinion/)\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Such moves are often interpreted as bullish signals, as they decrease immediate market supply and reflect confidence in further price appreciation.\nAbraxas Capital’s large-scale transfer is drawing attention amid a broader wave of accumulation.

At the same time, over $265 million in short positions were liquidated, accelerating the price move.\nThough ETH has gained 54% in the last month, it remains down 26% for the year. However, at CryptoQuant point out that Ethereum is now at its most undervalued level relative to Bitcoin since 2019, based on the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio.\nAbraxas Capital’s operations highlight the increasing involvement of institutions in the Ethereum markets.

Traders should prepare for possible price swings and increased market activity.\nApproximately $3 billion worth of Bitcoin [(BTC)](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/) and Ethereum [(ETH) ](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)options contracts are expiring before the start of the weekend. This significant event could lead to heightened volatility, as options expirations often result in increased trading activity and rapid price movements. With Bitcoin trading around $102,871 and Ethereum at $2,309, investors are closely watching for possible market shifts.\n## Key technical points,\n  * **Options Expiry Volume:** Approximately $3 billion in BTC and ETH options are expiring today, potentially leading to increased market volatility.\n  * **Market Sentiment Indicators:** The put-to-call ratios for Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest mixed market sentiments, with Ethereum showing a slightly more bullish outlook.\n  * **Potential Price Movements:** Traders anticipate possible price swings and increased market activity as a result of the options expiry.\n\n\nOptions contracts allow traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a specific date. The expiration of these contracts frequently sparks repositioning, leading to increased activity and short-term volatility. The sheer size of Friday’s expiry could influence near-term price dynamics.\nThe put-to-call ratio is a common metric used to gauge market sentiment. A ratio above 1 indicates a bearish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 suggests bullishness. Current data shows Bitcoin’s put-to-call ratio at 0.93, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment, whereas Ethereum’s ratio stands at 1.22, reflecting a more bearish outlook. \nAnalysts have mixed views on the impact of today’s options expiry. Some believe it could lead to short-term volatility and influence market sentiment, potentially driving prices higher if the prevailing sentiment is bullish. Others view it as a routine event with limited long-term impact, suggesting that while price swings may occur, broader factors such as regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a significant role in market trends.\n## What to expect in the market post-expiry\nFollowing the expiration of these options contracts, traders should be prepared for potential short-term volatility as the market adjusts. If bullish sentiment prevails, we could see upward price movements, particularly if key resistance levels are breached. \nConversely, if bearish sentiment dominates, prices may face downward pressure. It’s essential for traders to monitor market indicators and news closely, as external factors like regulatory changes and macroeconomic developments could also influence market direction in the coming days.\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

The change is intended to improve accessibility, increase liquidity, and lower trading barriers.\nThis move follows B3’s recent debut of the world’s first spot XRP ETF, further establishing the exchange as a leader in regulated crypto investment products.

The 24-hour volume soared by 170% to $353 million. \nTwo broader factors drove this rally. First, it surged as Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) and most altcoins soared, pushing the total crypto market cap to over $3.25 trillion. This surge was because of the ongoing Bitcoin accumulation and the rising hopes of trade deals between the US and other countries. \nSecond, the Pi Network community is anticipating a major ecosystem announcement next week. The timing aligns with the Consensus event in Toronto, where Pi Network’s founder Nikkolas Kokkalis is scheduled to speak.\nThis announcement could be a partnership with a large company, an ecosystem fund to incentivize developers, an exchange listing, or a token burn. \nRumors of a token burn gained traction after on-chain data revealed a [transfer](https://piscan.io/account-stats) of 84 million PI tokens to an unspecified address. Some suggest these tokens may have been moved to provide liquidity for a potential exchange listing.\nYou might also like:  [ Is Binance listing Pi Network soon? Wallet activity sparks rumors ahead of planned May 14 ecosystem update ](https://crypto.news/is-binance-listing-pi-network-soon-wallet-activity-sparks-rumors-ahead-of-planned-may-14-ecosystem-update/)\nA tier-1 exchange listing could serve as a major bullish catalyst. For example, the[ Pudgy Penguins](https://crypto.news/pengu-rallies-amid-uptbit-listing-and-surge-in-nft-sales/) ([PENGU](https://crypto.news/price/pudgy-penguins/)) price jumped by double digits on Friday after it was listed on Upbit, a top South Korean exchange.\nA token burn would also lead to a parabolic move because it would offset the ongoing token unlocks. [Data shows](https://piscan.io/unlock-statistics-monthly) that over 1.45 billion Pi coins will be unlocked in the next twelve months, diluting existing holders. These unlocks have led to higher supplies and contributed to the recent crash. \n## Pi Network price analysis\nThe ongoing Pi Coin price surge is in line with what we predicted [here](https://crypto.news/pi-network-price-bollinger-bands-point-to-an-upcoming-squeeze/)and [here](https://crypto.news/pi-network-sees-muted-price-action-amid-declining-trading-volume/)**.** In those articles, we pointed to the narrowing spread of the three Bollinger Bands lines, and that it was in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory.\nOn the 8-hour chart, Pi Coin bottomed at $0.5577 on April 29 before rallying to $0.7810 on Friday. This pattern has formed a cup-and-handle structure, a widely followed bullish continuation pattern.\nThe depth of the cup is approximately 30%. A measured move from the breakout point suggests a potential upside target of $1.10, a 41% rally from current levels. This move could materialize ahead of the expected announcement on May 14.\nYou might also like:  [ A 90-year-old theory suggests the Pi Network price may surge soon ](https://crypto.news/a-90-year-old-theory-suggests-the-pi-network-price-may-surge-soon/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese provided a detailed breakdown of Coinbase’s acquisition, earnings performance, and updated his outlook on the stock’s valuation.\n## Coinbase to acquire Deribit in $2.9b deal\nIn the largest crypto M&A deal to date, [Coinbase ](https://crypto.news/tag/coinbase/)announced plans to [acquire ](https://crypto.news/coinbase-to-acquire-deribit-for-2-9b-in-largest-deal-yet-report/)Deribit for $2.9 billion, consisting of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock. Deribit is the world’s largest crypto options exchange with a 75% market share and over $30 billion in open interest. \nAnalyst Mike Colonnese sees the deal as a strong strategic fit, immediately making Coinbase the leading global crypto derivatives platform, while accelerating its international expansion and boosting cross-sell potential with spot and futures trading. Deribit is expected to be accretive to profitability, given its consistent positive EBITDA track record.\n## Q1 2025 earnings recap\nCoinbase reported Q1 revenue of $2.03 billion, slightly below expectations, with trading volumes falling 10% quarter-over-quarter to $393 billion. Retail volumes dropped 17%, while institutional volumes declined 9%. Transaction revenue came in at $1.26 billion, down 19% sequentially and short of consensus. \nDespite weaker transaction revenue, subscription and services revenue hit a record $698.1 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong growth in USDC holdings and Coinbase One subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA was $929.9 million (47.4% margin), below Q4’s $1.29 billion, while adjusted EPS was $1.94, in line with consensus.\nYou might also like:  [ Coinbase calls on remaining US states to drop confusing staking lawsuits ](https://crypto.news/coinbase-calls-on-remaining-us-states-to-drop-confusing-staking-lawsuits/)\n## Price target revised lower despite clear catalysts for growth\nDespite what the analyst describes as a “monumental” Deribit acquisition, Colonnese revised his 2025 and 2026 revenue estimates downward to $7.4 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, citing weaker-than-expected transaction volumes. He also lowered his adjusted EPS forecasts to $5.92 and $12.11, with a price target lowered to $305 from $350. Still, the analyst remains optimistic about Coinbase’s long-term outlook, particularly as the regulatory environment evolves.\n> “We believe greater regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S., specifically as it relates to formal stablecoin and market structure legislation, which we could see this year, will prove to be a major tailwind for Coinbase, and will drive an acceleration of institutional participation into the space,” Colonnese wrote.\nIn addition, more than 200 firms including BlackRock and PayPal already rely on Coinbase’s infrastructure and more tarditional finance institutions will find it beneficial “to seek out” Coinbase’s products and services rather than build their own.\nAs such, “the stars are aligning for an extended bull market for crypto over the next 12 to 18 months,” the analyst wrote.\nYou might also like:  [ Coinbase CEO pushes congress to pass stablecoin bill before August ](https://crypto.news/coinbase-ceo-pushes-congress-to-pass-stablecoin-bill-before-august/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

On Thursday, May 8, Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to [12 years in prison](https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-founder-alex-mashinsky-gets-12-years-prison-crypto-fraud-2025-05-08/) for his role in the firm’s bankruptcy, which cost its users billions.\nAccording to the prosecution, Mashinsky victimized thousands of people, many of whom lost their life savings. At the same time, the disgraced founder stole more than $48 million from Celsius. Mashinsky pleaded guilty to securities and commodities fraud.\n## Mashinsky pleads for sympathy\nThe sentence fell short of the 20-year term requested by the Department of Justice, which called it a just punishment. Mashinsky disagreed, and his lawyers, in a May 5 filing, described the DOJ’s request as a [‘death-in-prison’ sentence](https://crypto.news/celsius-founder-mashinsky-slams-dojs-20-year-request-as-a-death-in-prison-sentence/). They argued that Mashinsky never intended to harm customers or steal their money.\nHis legal team attempted to elicit sympathy by highlighting the persecution his Jewish family faced in Soviet Russia and his military service in the Israeli Defense Forces. However, the judge did not take those factors into consideration during sentencing.\nYou might also like:  [ Celsius CEO selects Bankman-Fried lawyers for upcoming trial ](https://crypto.news/celsius-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-lawyers/)\nCelsius was a crypto lender that promised high interest rates while touting the safety of its investments.

At its height, the firm claimed it had 1.7 million users, managed $11.7 billion worth of assets, and gave out $8 billion in loans. \nBut in 2022, as the crypto market faced extreme volatility, Celsius’s operations began to unravel. Instead of secure loans, the firm had engaged in highly leveraged trading strategies. When markets turned, those positions collapsed, leaving Celsius insolvent and its depositors with billions in losses.\nRead more:  [ What happened to Celsius Network: a year in review ](https://crypto.news/what-happened-to-celsius-network-a-year-in-review/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Bitcoin’s market cap has surged past $2 trillion, while the total crypto market cap has climbed to $3.25 trillion.\nSeveral factors are fueling the Bitcoin rally. First, optimism is growing that trade tensions between the United States and other major economies may ease. The U.S. has already finalized a deal with the UK, and top officials are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts this weekend.\nAn end to the current tariff regime would be a positive catalyst for both stocks and cryptocurrencies, as it would ease recession concerns, reduce inflationary pressure, and improve the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nYou might also like:  [ $900M liquidated from crypto market as Bitcoin surges past $103K in latest rally ](https://crypto.news/900m-liquidated-from-crypto-market-as-bitcoin-surges-past-103k-in-latest-rally/)\nAdditionally, analysts have upgraded their Bitcoin forecasts. In a recent note, Standard Chartered said its previous $120,000 target was too conservative. CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju admitted he was [wrong to call the end of the bull cycle](https://crypto.news/cryptoquant-ceo-admits-he-was-wrong-about-bitcoin-bull-cycle/). He expects BTC to have more upside, helped by rising institutional demand. \nMeanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $40 billion in inflows since January 2024, with more than $1.7 billion added this month alone. Companies like Semler Scientific, Strategy, and MetaPlanet have continued to accumulate BTC through these ETFs.\nBitcoin price may keep rising as investors become greedy. The crypto fear and greed index has jumped to the greed zone of 70. Historically, Bitcoin and other altcoins do well when investors are greedy.\n## Bitcoin price technical analysis\nThe weekly chart shows that BTC bottomed at $79,510 in April and has now posted five consecutive weeks of gains. It remains above the 100-week Weighted Moving Average, a sign that bulls continue to dominate the market.\nBitcoin now appears poised to retest its all-time high at $109,400. With both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD trending upward, momentum favors the bulls.\nA breakout above that level would confirm bullish continuation and potentially propel BTC toward the next psychological milestone at $110,000.\nYou might also like:  [ BONK, FLOKI, BRETT, and PEPE price prediction: triple-digits gains in sight as price action heats up ](https://crypto.news/bonk-floki-brett-and-pepe-price-prediction-triple-digits-gains-in-sight-as-price-action-heats-up/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

The Financial Supervisory Commission is expected to roll out institutional crypto custody trials later this year. In contrast, mainland China continues to enforce a blanket ban on most crypto-related activities.\nTaiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission released a draft of the “Virtual Asset Service Act” on March 25 to regulate crypto businesses and protect investors. The [draft included](https://crypto.news/taiwans-fsc-released-the-draft-of-virtual-asset-service-act-outlining-crypto-regulations/) licensing requirements for VASPs, standards for stablecoin issuance by banks, and enforcement measures. \nA 60-day public consultation period was launched, with the law expected to be submitted to the Executive Yuan by June 30.\nKo’s call positions Taiwan among a small but growing group of jurisdictions exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

On Friday, May 9, Vector Smart Chain introduced a fixed gas fee model aimed at balancing security, stability, and scalability on the network.\nAll gas fees on Vector Smart Chain will now cost a flat rate of $4, providing users with predictable costs and boosting confidence, especially among enterprise clients, which are a primary focus for VSC. The chain’s hybrid consensus mechanism emphasizes high throughput and near-instant finality, appealing to corporate users.\n> “The $4 gas fee isn’t arbitrary—it’s carefully designed to balance network security and accessibility. We’re removing the guesswork from blockchain,” VSC spokesperson said. \nIn addition, this model is designed to make VSC deflationary in a predictable way. With each transaction, exactly $1 worth of VSC tokens will be burned, reducing total supply in proportion to network activity.\n## Vector Smart Chain appoints former CityGroup executive\nIn tandem with the rollout of its new gas model, VSC also announced the appointment of a former Chief Financial Officer at CitiGroup Finance. Peter Ritchie will join the Layer 1 network as Strategic Finance Executive Consultant, helping to advance the platform’s long-term financial strategy.\n> “This isn’t just about blockchain—it’s about building a transparent, resilient financial future. VSC is uniquely positioned to lead that evolution,” Peter Ritchie, VSC. \nRitchie will guide VSC’s global financial roadmap and ensure its economic model remains sustainable. He will also work on strengthening the network’s integration with institutional and enterprise clients. In addition, Ritchie will play a role in VSC’s efforts to achieve carbon-neutral status.\nVSC is already gaining traction. Recently, BESC Exchange announced it would migrate from Solana to VSC, citing the network’s infrastructure and economic model as offering the highest potential for growth.\nRead more:  [ The paradox of progress: Blockchain’s true breakthrough lies in its constraints | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/blockchains-true-breakthrough-lies-in-its-constraints/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

As a result, his tribute meme coin LLJEFFY has fallen by 40%.\nAccording to a [report](https://sfstandard.com/2025/05/08/jeffy-yu-zerebro-fake-death/) by local news outlet The San Francisco Standard, Jeffy Yu was confirmed to be alive and living in his parents’ home, five days after the 23-year-old crypto mogul seemingly took his own life on a livestream.\nOn-chain traders have speculated that Yu faked his own death as a way to depart from the crypto space. Especially after Yu’s obituary on the memorial platform, Legacy was removed a few days after it was published. Not only that, on-chain activity shows that there have been multiple transactions linked to Yu’s wallet after his alleged death.\nOn May 9, a reporter from the San Francisco Standard confirmed that Yu was not dead. Instead, he had been living in a two-story home with his parents. Yu declined to provide any commentary about the false reports of his death and how he benefited from it. However, the Zerebro ([ZEREBRO](https://crypto.news/price/zerebro/)) founder said that he would be moving his parents out of the home within a week due to fearing that other people would be able to track down his whereabouts.\n“I’ve been doxxed. I’ve been harassed. If you can find me, other people can find me,” said Yu.\nAccording to [DEX Screener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/hdg8eqavqak5fsmsgm1cgpjjejqulroj7j7uupqpy3gy), the Solana ([SOL](https://crypto.news/price/solana/))-based [meme coin](https://crypto.news/tag/meme-coin/) LLJEFFY, created to honour Yu’s legacy, has fallen more than 40% following the news of Yu being alive. A far cry from its previous high when the token skyrocketed as high as 2,115% after news of Yu’s livestreamed suicide began to circulate. At the moment, the token has accumulated a market cap of $2.1 million.\n“If you’re reading this, it’s because my 72-hour deadman’s switch triggered, so I’m not here, at least physically,” said the Zerebro co-founder in a scheduled blog post linked to the meme coin.\n“This is a legacoin, my final art piece. $LLJEFFY,” he wrote.\nOn the other hand, Yu’s original staple token, ZEREBRO, has been on the rise. In the past 24 hours of trading, the token has gone up by 22.3%. It is currently valued at $0.048. In the past few days the token has also suffered a similar downfall to its “legacoin” counterpart, dropping by nearly 10% in the past week and declining by 34.8% in the past two weeks.\nYou might also like:  [ Fake ‘Hong Kong coin’ promoted by chief executive impersonator account ](https://crypto.news/fake-hong-kong-coin-promoted-by-chief-executive-impersonator-account/)\n## Controversy surrounding Zerebro founder Jeffy Yu’s ‘suicide’\nOn May 4, Zerebro co-founder Jeffy Yu was [thought](https://crypto.news/on-chain-clues-spark-speculation-zerebro-founder-jeffy-yu-isnt-dead-after-all/) to have committed suicide. A video broadcast on meme coin launch platform [Pump.fun](https://crypto.news/tag/pump-fun/) showed Yu smoking a cigarette before shooting himself in the neck. The video was then shared multiple times on social media platform X.\nTwo days later, Yu’s obituary was published on the memorial platform Legacy. However, many traders suspected Yu had faked his own death after on-chain data showed that his wallet was still actively making transactions.\nAnalytics platforms like Bubblemaps and Lookonchain revealed that the LLJEFFY deployer and associated wallets were actively trading and burning tokens after Yu’ alleged death. Not only that, but an unverified was found indicating that his death had been staged.\nAllegedly written by Yu, the letter stated that the Zerebro founder had faked his death as he believed it was the “only viable exit from persistent harassment, blackmail, and threats.”\nYou might also like:  [ On-chain clues spark speculation Zerebro founder Jeffy Yu isn’t dead after all ](https://crypto.news/on-chain-clues-spark-speculation-zerebro-founder-jeffy-yu-isnt-dead-after-all/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

He believes that the market is currently in a transitional phase.\nIn a recent , [CryptoQuant](https://crypto.news/tag/cryptoquant/) founder and CEO Ki Young Ju apologized to his followers for making an incorrect prediction regarding the end of Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) [bull](https://crypto.news/tag/bull-market/) cycle earlier in March 2025. This was proven by the apparent comeback BTC made when it returned to the $100k mark on May 8, shortly after [President Trump](https://crypto.news/tag/donald-trump/) announced a new trade deal with the [U.K.](https://crypto.news/tag/united-kingdom/)\n“I apologize for the incorrect prediction. I will strive to provide higher-quality analyses in the future. Thank you,” said Ju.\nHe concluded that the BTC market no longer relies on the traditional whale and retail-dominated model, instead it is diversified by the presence of [ETFs](https://crypto.news/tag/etf/) and other institutional players.\n“The Bitcoin market has become much more diverse. ETFs, MicroStrategy (MSTR), institutional investors, and even government agencies are considering buying and selling Bitcoin,” said Ju in his post.\nAs a result, the CryptoQuant CEO stated that it may be time to throw out the practice of only using “profit-taking cycles” to measure market sentiment. These cycles are demonstrated by whales cashing out during peak price periods, which usually triggers a domino effect of sell-offs that eventually lead to a price drop.\n“Now, instead of worrying about old whales selling, it’s more important to focus on how much new liquidity is coming from institutions and ETFs since this new influx can outweigh even strong whale sell-offs,” continued Ju.\nYou might also like:  [ Steak ‘N Shake to accept Bitcoin payments this month ](https://crypto.news/steak-n-shake-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-this-month/)\nAt press time, BTC has gone up by more than 3% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $102,773. This is the first time BTC has surpassed the $100,000 threshold since February this year. However, its daily trading volume has dipped by over 30% to $51 billion.\nAlthough Ju believes that the indicators of a bearish or a bullish market are changing, he still maintains the significance of analysing on-chain data to determine the direction of the market, as he has done in previous market analyses.\nOverall, Ju stated the market is currently in a transitional period, where it is neither bullish nor bearish at the moment. This is because he observed that the market is still slow in absorbing new liquidity.\n“Of course, the recent price action is extremely bullish, but I’m talking about the profit-taking cycle,” clarified Ju.\nBack in March, Ki Young Ju [predicted](https://crypto.news/cryptoquant-ceo-bitcoins-bull-cycle-is-over-prices-could-fall-lower-due-to-whale-action/) that in the next six to 12 months, Bitcoin will see “bearish or sideways price action.” To support his point, Ju shared a historical chart, which highlighted BTC’s profit and loss index cyclical signals dating back from 2014 until the present day.\nShortly after, Bitcoin had continued to descend until it dipped below $75,000 after Trump announced his Liberation Day blanket tariffs.\nRead more:  [ CryptoQuant CEO: Bitcoin’s bull cycle is over, prices could fall lower due to whale action ](https://crypto.news/cryptoquant-ceo-bitcoins-bull-cycle-is-over-prices-could-fall-lower-due-to-whale-action/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Meanwhile, its 24-hour trading volume surged nearly 100% to $500 million.\nThe token’s market cap is now sitting at $972 million, inching just $28 million shy of the $1 billion milestone.\nThe key catalyst behind today’s move was Upbit, a tier-1 South Korea-based crypto exchange, which [listed](https://t.co/EXb7k4d2qg) PENGU on its spot trading platform.\nActivity in PENGU’s derivatives market spiked after the Bithumb announcement broke.

The entire Solana meme coin sector surged 28.7% in market capitalization over the past day, to over $12.1 billion.\nThis broader surge in meme coins has been largely driven by [Bitcoin’s breakout above $100,000](https://crypto.news/what-tariff-shock-bitcoin-surges-past-100k-as-market-recovery-continues/), marking its first time crossing that milestone since February, which has reignited bullish sentiment across the crypto market.\n## PENGU price analysis\nLooking at the charts, PENGU has broken out of a descending parallel channel pattern on the 4-hour/USDT chart, a move that’s typically seen as a bullish reversal signal in technical analysis.\nMomentum indicators back up the breakout. The Aroon Up sits high at 92.86% while the Aroon Down is down at 28.57%, signaling that buyers are clearly in control right now.\nAdding to the bullish setup, the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, reinforcing the positive momentum.\nWith these signals aligning, PENGU could be setting its sights on the next big hurdle: the psychological resistance level at $0.021, a price it’s struggled to break since February.\nIf bulls can push it past that level, the next stop could be around $0.022, a key support-turned-resistance from earlier in January.\nAt press time, PENGU had pared some of its earlier gains and was trading at $0.014 per coin.

The breakout occurred on April 22, when the [memecoin](https://crypto.news/tag/meme-coin)‘s price decisively closed above this trendline and broke above the local resistance at around $0.000015. The breakout rally then sent BONK price to its peak of $0.000021 on April 28, marking an approximately 75% increase since April 22 pre-breakout opening price of $0.000012. \nA fullback followed, but the price rebounded with a strong leg up and is now testing the resistance formed by the previous high at the $0.000020 level. If this momentum sustains, BONK is likely targeting the 0.000025 level next, with potential for further upside toward 0.000030 in the medium term as it reclaims prior resistance zones.\nFloki ([FLOKI](https://crypto.news/price/floki/)) broke out of its sustained downtrend with a decisive move above the descending trendline around April 9, followed by a period of bullish consolidation. On April 22, it staged an explosive rally that sent the price to $0.000095 on April at its peak. After a brief pullback, the price resumed its upward move, reaching a new high at $0.00010, where it trades at press time. Since the April 22 opening at $0.000058, the price has now gained about 72%.

This breakout candle also confirmed the neckline of a double bottom pattern, establishing a key resistance level. That resistance was then tested and broken on April 22, when PEPE made a new higher high. After a brief pullback, a strong rally began on May 6, driving the price up to a new peak of $0.00001310. Since April 22 breakout of the double bottom’s neckline, the price has gained about 69%. \nThe current price action shows strong continuation, with PEPE now testing resistance zone around the $0.000013. If momentum persists, the next, short-term [PEPE price prediction](https://crypto.news/pepe-price-prediction-for-may-2025/) is $0.000016, which coincides with previous support-turned-resistance levels from mid- to late January.\nBrett’s ([BRETT](https://crypto.news/price/brett/)) downtrend [began to shift](https://crypto.news/brett-price-jumps-17-eyes-0-15-as-next-target/) around March 11, when the price entered a tight consolidation range between $0.026 and $0.036.

The platform allegedly facilitated money laundering for major crypto heists including the Bybit and Multisig hacks.\nAccording to an official [statement](https://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/7/6029813) issued on May 9, the Frankfurt Prosecutor’s Office announced it had shut down the crypto exchange platform, seizing an array of crypto assets worth 34 million euros or equal to $38.2 million. These assets consisted of a mix of Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)), Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)), Litecoin ([LTC](https://crypto.news/price/litecoin/)), and Dash ([DASH](https://crypto.news/price/dash/)).\nThe prosecutor’s office dubbed it the “third-largest seizure of crypto assets in the history of the BKA.” Authorities accused the team behind the platform of commercial [money laundering](https://crypto.news/tag/money-laundering/) and operating a criminal trading platform.\nAccording to renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT, the platform was used to launder hundreds of millions of funds from some of the largest crypto hacks in history. \nIt was allegedly used to launder funds from the $1.5 billion [Bybit hack](https://crypto.news/live/bybit-hack/), the $1.4 billion Multisig hack, the FixedFloat exploit, and the theft of around $243 million from Genesis Creditor, as well as various [phishing](https://crypto.news/tag/phishing/) scams over the past few years.\nYou might also like:  [ Lazarus Group spies set up U.S. shell companies to dupe crypto developers: report ](https://crypto.news/lazarus-group-spies-set-up-u-s-shell-companies-to-dupe-crypto-developers-report/)\nThe internet sleuth claimed the platform had repeatedly refused to block addresses and freeze orders related to these hacks.\nDirector of the Federal Criminal Police Office and Head of the Cybercrime Division, Carsten Meywirth has confirmed that the bureau has secured “a record-breaking sum of millions in incriminating cryptocurrencies” as well as effectively shut down the platform.\n“We will continue to increase the risk of loss for the underground economy with all the means at our disposal. Our goal remains to hold those responsible accountable,” said Meywirth.\n## How did eXch allegedly launder hacking funds?\neXch is known as a crypto [exchange](https://crypto.news/tag/exchange/) service that allowed customers to swap between [crypto assets](https://crypto.news/tag/crypto-assets/) easily. It was made accessible on both the public web as well as the dark web. In fact, it has been specifically marketing itself on sites linked to the criminal underground. \nIt appealed to dark web operators because unlike most crypto exchange platforms, it did not abide to anti-money laundering measures. This meant that users did not have to identify themselves or submit [Know-Your-Customer](https://crypto.news/tag/kyc/) verification. The platform also claimed it does not store user information.\nTherefore, the platform made it particularly increasingly easy for users to cover their financial tracks. Since it was established in 2014, the platform has facilitated around $1.9 billion worth of crypto transactions. Authorities suspect the platform has been accepting Bitcoin originating from illegal activity.\nNot only that, the Frankfurt law enforcement have found evidence that the platform may have been used to launder a portion of the $1.5 billion of stolen funds from the [Bybit](https://crypto.news/tag/bybit/) hack.\nOn Feb. 21, crypto exchange Bybit suffered one of the largest exploits in the web3 space.

Seriously, some parts of the world are pretty much completely left in the dark — that’s [according](https://www.undrr.org/reports/global-status-MHEWS-2024) to the World Meteorological Organization. Such statistics should worry everyone. As storms grow more violent and unpredictable (yes, the rise in greenhouse gases has [increased](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/) the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events), the ability to forecast and act on severe weather isn’t a luxury — it’s a requirement for survival. And it’s not like we don’t have the technology; the tools are there. It’s our systems that fail us, fail the millions of people left behind, and web3 has a chance to make a real impact there.\nYou might also like:  [ Transitioning to a divine economy: A vision for a new civilization | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/transitioning-to-divine-decentralized-economy-opinion/)\n## No data, no defense\nWhen we talk about weather data, the consequences of missing or delayed forecasts are very real. In 2024, devastating floods [swept](https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/west-and-central-africa-flooding-situation-overview-31-october-2024) through Chad, displacing families, washing away homes, and affecting millions of people. The country’s meteorological systems were not sufficient. At the height of the crisis, nearly [80%](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/africa-grapples-with-forecasting-challenge-weather-disasters-loom-2024-11-14/#:~:text=Around%2080%25%20of%20the%20devices,%3A%E2%80%9Cdevastating%20floods%E2%80%9D%5D.) of the country’s weather stations were offline. \nWith so little real-time data to go on, emergency planners and local officials were left guessing. The warnings came too late, which resulted in a catastrophic loss. But this is something that can happen again if nothing is done—WMO data [shows](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/death-tolls-from-climate-disasters-will-balloon-without-investment-in-africas-weather-stations) that more than 50% of the radar stations that currently operate across Africa are unable to produce accurate enough data to predict weather patterns for the coming days or even hours. This isn’t just unfair, it’s dangerous.\n## The limits of centralized forecasting\nFor many years, weather forecasting services have relied on centralized hardware such as satellites and radar stations. While these systems have saved lives, they’re still very limited by geography, budgets, and other factors. These systems can’t always reach the local level fast enough, especially in emergency situations. In many countries, especially those with stretched resources, large parts of the population are simply beyond the reach of the existing infrastructure. \nCurrent forecasting systems also tend to prioritize countries that already have robust systems. The rest of the world, where climate often hits the hardest, is asked to adapt without the same level of information or tools. For example, Africa, a continent of 1.5 billion people, has the world’s least developed weather and climate observation network with fewer stations operating to global basic standards than Germany, [according](https://wmo.int/media/news/closing-gaps-observing-network) to the World Meteorological Organization. So, what can be done to tackle this?\n## Decentralized solutions\nThere’s another way to think about weather infrastructure — decentralized weather networks take a very different approach. Instead of building a few nodes to cover large areas, they deploy thousands of inexpensive sensors at the community level. This approach leverages the [decentralized physical infrastructure networks](https://crypto.news/decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-depin-explained/) model, which rewards people and communities with tokens for setting up real-world infrastructure. This infrastructure can include sensors gathering data in real time: from temperature and humidity to rainfall and more. That data is shared across a distributed network and used to improve forecasts, identify patterns, and alert people about the emerging risks.\nThe beauty of these systems is that they don’t need to replace anything. They complement the existing methods. They fill in the gaps and help to strengthen the overall forecast. They can also operate independently when larger systems fail and give communities the tools they need to generate their own data—and act on it.\n## Time to change the status quo\nSkeptics will say decentralized systems are too new to be trusted. While there may be some work to be done in decentralized networks becoming more widespread, the answer isn’t to dismiss the model. It’s to invest in it. To make it part of the solution. Dismissing the whole idea is short-sighted. Climate adaptation is a global challenge, and if the current systems don’t reach the people who need them the most, then it’s time to build systems that do.\nThe alternative — sticking with what we have — isn’t working. Centralized systems are already struggling to keep up, especially in the places that need them the most. In many parts of the world, weather stations are broken, and the data simply doesn’t come in fast enough. Meanwhile, the weather gets more unpredictable by the season.\n## Act now, before the next disaster\nThe tools already exist; what’s missing is the mindset shift. We need to recognize that centralized systems can’t do this alone, and that communities deserve better. People and rural communities can and should be part of the solution. We can’t wait for the next devastating flood, historic cyclone, or life-changing drought to remind us that something is broken. The early warnings are already here. We need to act on them now.\nRead more:  [ Streamlining sustainability with decentralized data | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/sustainability-with-decentralized-data-opinion/)\nTing Peng \n**Ting Peng** is the head of ecosystems at SkyX, a blockchain-powered weather network.

A Fortune report shows a group of traders that bought millions of dollars worth of MELANIA gained nearly $100 million in profits by selling the meme coin at its peak. \nDogecoin ([DOGE](https://crypto.news/price/dogecoin/)), Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://crypto.news/price/shiba-inu/)) and Pepe ([PEPE](https://crypto.news/price/pepe/)) rallied alongside Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) as the largest cryptocurrency beat the $100,000 milestone and climbed past the resistance on Thursday. DOGE, SHIB and PEPE’s price dipped slightly, down 2%, 1.60% and 3.51% on the day. \nTable of Contents\n## Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe rally\nThe top three meme coins ranked by market capitalization observed nearly double-digit gains on Thursday after Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone. DOGE, SHIB and PEPE gained 10%, 9% and 23% on the day, breaking past key resistances on the daily timeframe. \nOn Friday in the early hours, the three meme coins erased part of their gains and faced a correction, likely a result of profit-taking by traders. \nThe two dog-themed cryptocurrencies and the internet meme based-frog are in the spotlight as traders’ portfolios \nSolidus Labs’ report shows 98.6% of meme tokens launched on Solana’s Pump.fun launchpad and 93% of liquidity pools on Raydium exhibited signs of what is considered “fraudulent activity.” Fraudulent activity includes pump-and-dump schemes and rug pulls that are common in the meme token ecosystem.\nYou might also like:  [ Ethereum price reclaims $2000: is this the start of a major bull run? ](https://crypto.news/how-high-can-pepe-price-jump-after-flipping-key-resistance/)\n## Bitcoin is back above $100,000 ignites crypto bull run\nBitcoin climbed to $103,268 early on Friday, breaking past sticky resistance at $100,000. One of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin’s breakout is US trade announcements, the return of certainty to tariff negotiations between the United States and several nations and the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. \nThe next two resistances for Bitcoin are $106,457, a key level for BTC since it hit its previous all-time high and R2 at $109,588. BTC is less than 5% away from the first key resistance. A key technical indicator, the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line, signaling an underlying positive momentum in Bitcoin’s price trend. \nBitcoin’s rally to $100,000 was accompanied by a rally in top meme tokens across exchanges.\nYou might also like:  [ BTC holds above $100K as markets soar: Can Pepe, Shiba, or Pepeto be the next 100x memecoins? ](https://crypto.news/btc-holds-above-100k-as-markets-soar-can-pepe-shiba-or-pepeto-be-the-next-100x-memecoins/)\n## MELANIA makes headlines for wrong reasons\nMELANIA, the meme coin launched by the United States’ First Lady is making headlines for allegations of a group of traders dumping the token at its peak for nearly $100 million in gains within days of launch. \nA Fortune [report](https://fortune.com/2025/05/07/melania-trump-memecoin-anonymous-traders-100-million-payday/) shows a vast majority of the MELANIA token was exchanged for USD Coin ([USDC](https://crypto.news/price/usd-coin/)), a stablecoin backed by the US Dollar. Another report by the Financial Times alleges that traders purchased millions of MELANIA tokens minutes before the token was publicly launched, raising concerns of “insider groups,” and their trading activity. \nMELANIA price is down 97% from its all-time high, trades at $0.3437 on Kraken at the time of writing. \n## Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe price forecast\nDogecoin is poised to extend gains by another 12% and test resistance at R1, $0.21465, one of the key levels for the meme coin. Another resistance is R2, at $0.24040, as seen on the daily timeframe. \nBoth R1 and R2 are the upper and lower boundaries of FVGs on the daily price chart. DOGE could find support at $0.16358, as seen in the DOGE/USDT chart. \nRSI and MACD support a bullish thesis for Dogecoin, RSI reads 63 and is sloping upwards and MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line, meaning that Dogecoin has a positive underlying momentum in its price trend. \nShiba Inu could extend gains by another 10%, and the SHIB/USDT daily price chart looks bullish. SHIB faces resistances at R1 and R2, $0.00001532 and $0.00001688. These are two key resistance levels for Shiba Inu on the daily timeframe. A 10% rally would lead to a re-test of R1 and R2 would come into play as the target for Shiba Inu price. \nShiba Inu could find support at $0.00001215, as seen in the chart below. RSI and MACD support the thesis for price gain. \nPEPE stands out among the top 3 meme coins with the highest likelihood of gains, 27%. PEPE is positioned for a double-digit price rally and a test of resistance R1 at $0.00001206, the upper boundary of an FVG on the daily timeframe. PEPE could re-test resistance at $0.00001336, and in the event of a correction, the $0.00000828 level could act as support. \nRSI is sloping upwards and reads 72, MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. Both momentum indicators are aligned with an extension of PEPE price rally. \n## Top 5 meme coins to watch\nAs Bitcoin continues its climb past the $103,000 level and beyond, traders expect that BTC will revisit the previous all-time high above $109,000. In that case, the top five meme coins to watch, apart from DOGE, SHIB and PEPE are Official Trump ([TRUMP](https://crypto.news/price/trumpcoin/)), Bonk ([BONK](https://crypto.news/price/bonk/)), Fartcoin ([FARTCOIN](https://crypto.news/price/fartcoin/)), Pudgy Penguins ([PENGU](https://crypto.news/price/pudgy-penguins/)) and FLOKI ([FLOKI](https://crypto.news/price/floki/)). \nThe meme coins based on the Solana and Base chain could potentially rally higher alongside Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe while market traders’ sentiment remains bullish and Bitcoin rallies. A flash crash in Bitcoin could usher a market correction, typically the most speculative category of tokens suffer steep corrections meaning meme tokens could observe a notable decline. \nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

His primary contact during the scheme was a British-born ISIS member based in Syria known for planning terror attacks and orchestrating breakouts.\nProsecutors said Chhipa used various tactics to hide his activity, including misspelled email accounts and aliases when buying travel tickets, and even attempted to flee the U.S. during the investigation.\nHe traveled through multiple countries, including Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, and Germany, before he was stopped in Egypt and returned to the U.S. under an Interpol Blue Notice.\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert, “Chhipa knowingly and persistently collected and provided a considerable amount of money to fund the violence of an organization bent on forcing their extremist ideology on others.”\nThe May 7 sentencing is the latest in a growing series of U.S. enforcement actions targeting the use of cryptocurrency in terrorist financing. Authorities have ramped up efforts to dismantle digital funding networks linked to groups like ISIS, Hamas, [Hezbollah](https://crypto.news/ofac-targets-hezbollah-linked-crypto-financier-to-disrupt-irans-terror-funding/), and the Houthis. \nLast month, the DOJ seized over $200,000 in cryptocurrency tied to Hamas operations, part of a broader scheme that laundered over $1.5 million since October 2024. \nThe U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has also been actively targeting wallets associated with sanctioned entities. In April the agency, [blacklisted](https://crypto.news/ofac-sanctions-crypto-addresses-linked-to-russias-garantex-to-disrupt-houthi-financing/) eight crypto addresses used by the Houthis to fund arms purchases and evade sanctions.\nU.S. enforcement agencies [continue to stress](https://crypto.news/democrats-blast-doj-for-giving-free-pass-to-crypto-criminals-with-ncet-shutdown/) that disrupting financial pipelines is key to weakening terror groups’ capabilities.\nRead more:  [ Lawmaker warns crypto miners in Chechnya will be treated like terrorists in 2025 ](https://crypto.news/lawmaker-warns-crypto-miners-in-chechnya-will-be-treated-like-terrorists-in-2025/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

    "content": "By [Rony Roy](https://crypto.news/author/ronyroy/)\nMay 9, 2025 at 8:05 AM UTC\nNews\nShare \nMoo Deng price gained momentum on Friday as it soared by over 136%, making it one of the best-performing tokens in crypto.\nMoo Deng ([MOODENG](https://crypto.news/price/moo-deng/)), the pygmy hippo-themed meme coin, surged to an intraday high of $0.104 on May 9 afternoon Asian time—its highest level since Feb. 1. The token has now gained over 300% from its yearly low.\nThe ongoing surge coincides with a nearly 440% spike in futures open interest, hitting $125 million, the highest since Jan. 7 per CoinGlass [data](https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/MOODENG). Just a month ago, open interest was sitting at only $13.4 million. Rising open interest usually points to growing interest from traders and more speculative activity in the market.\nThe rally also aligns with the altcoin’s weighted funding rate flipping positive today. A positive funding rate basically means that traders going long are paying a small fee to shorts. It’s a sign that more people are leaning bullish and willing to pay up to hold their long positions.\nMeanwhile, on-chain data shows investors are holding onto their tokens, with exchanges seeing seven straight days of net outflows totaling around $3.5 million. That’s generally bullish because it suggests people are moving tokens off exchanges into private wallets, reducing the immediate selling pressure.\nYou might also like:  [ Ethereum rallies 20% as ETH reaches its most undervalued level relative to BTC since 2019 ](https://crypto.news/ethereum-rallies-20-as-eth-reaches-its-most-undervalued-level-relative-to-btc-since-2019/)\nAdding fuel to the hype, there’s growing buzz in the community that Binance might list MOODENG on its spot market. While nothing is confirmed, speculation is heating up since MOODENG is already trading on Binance Futures and has listings on big exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, Bitget, and Gate.io.\nMOODENG’s rally today also mirrors a wider memecoin boom, fuelled in part by [Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000](https://crypto.news/dow-gains-250-points-bitcoin-reclaims-100k-after-trump-promotes-u-k-trade-deal/) for the first time since February. \nThe bellwether’s momentum has reignited risk appetite across the market, sending the total memecoin market cap up 15% in the last 24 hours. Other big names like Pepe ([PEPE](https://crypto.news/price/pepe/)), Pudgy Penguins ([PENGU](https://crypto.news/price/pudgy-penguins/)), Popcat ([POPCAT](https://crypto.news/price/popcat/)), and Mog Coin ([MOG](https://crypto.news/price/mog-coin/)) have also posted strong gains of 20–50%.\nBitcoin was trading around $103,075 at press time, just shy of its all-time high, dominating market sentiment and helping pull a broad range of altcoins higher.\n## MOODENG price analysis\nOn the 4-hour USDT chart, MOODENG has broken above the upper boundary of a bull flag pattern, signaling a potential continuation of the uptrend based on classic technical analysis.\nImportantly, the 50-day moving average is still holding above the 200-day, meaning the golden cross is still intact, keeping the longer-term bullish trend in play.\nMomentum indicators are also lining up with the bullish outlook. The MACD lines have turned upward, hinting at growing positive momentum.\nOn top of that, the Relative Strength Index has surged deep into overbought territory, hitting 94.7. While this could signal that the rally is overheated in the short term, strong rallies in meme coins can stay overbought longer than expected.\nWith this setup, MOODENG could continue climbing toward its next big hurdle at the $0.20 psychological resistance level. A clean break above that could pave the way for bulls to target this year’s high of $0.31, which was last seen on Jan. 4.\nAs previously [noted](https://crypto.news/altcoin-season-nears-as-bitcoin-dominance-gets-overbought/) by analysts at crypto.news, historical trends suggest that once Bitcoin’s dominance approaches the 72.92% level, last seen in December 2022, investors could begin rotating capital into altcoins.\nCurrently, Bitcoin Dominance sits at 64.14%. If history repeats, it could result in additional momentum for memecoins like MOODENG in the coming weeks.\nRead more:  [ Sui integrates Axelar Network for cross-chain interoperability amid short-term price rally ](https://crypto.news/sui-integrates-axelar-network-for-cross-chain-interoperability-amid-short-term-price-rally/)\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. \nAI predicts this altcoin could outshine Polkadot and Polygon by 2025, here’s why investors are watching XYZVerse.\nTable of Contents\nRecently, AI has pinpointed a specific altcoin that is expected to surpass Polkadot and Polygon by 2025. This cryptocurrency is projected to make significant strides in the market, possibly overtaking its prominent rivals. Uncover which digital asset is gaining attention and why it might be a game-changer in the crypto industry.\n## XYZ forecast: Could XYZVerse deliver a 30x surge?\nXYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin scene at a time when community-backed tokens are driving some of the biggest gains in crypto. The explosive rise of PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows just how powerful branding, viral content, and a loyal community can be in today’s market.\nWith the altcoin season on the horizon, interest in lower-cap tokens is ramping up. As XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, it stands to benefit from this momentum—especially if it locks in solid exchange listings and sustains community excitement beyond launch.\nWhy XYZVerse stands out\n  * Powerful branding: Leveraging sports and influencer partnerships to expand its reach\n  * Deflationary supply: 17.13% token burn to reduce circulating supply\n  * Liquidity support: 15% allocated to provide post-launch price stability\n  * Community-focused: 10% dedicated to incentives that reward early backers and boost engagement\n\n\nPrice outlook for $XYZ\n  * Presale price: $0.003333\n  * Initial target: $0.10 (as estimated by the team)\n  * Potential high in first weeks: $0.15 – $0.25 (driven by hype and exchange listings)\n  * Long-term range (6–12 months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if key partnerships and utility are delivered)\n\n\nReaching $0.10 from the current presale price would mean a 30x gain, an ambitious but plausible target if the project nails its launch strategy. Key factors that could drive this are given below.\n  * Top-tier exchange listings: Platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance would significantly boost visibility and volume.\n  * Community virality: Strong execution on sports and influencer campaigns could create the social buzz needed for FOMO.\n  * Bullish market conditions: If the crypto market remains hot, meme coins tend to outperform due to their speculative appeal.\n\n\nXYZVerse has the right ingredients for a breakout. But long-term success will depend on more than hype. If the team delivers on roadmap promises, secures major partnerships, and keeps its community engaged, a move beyond $0.10 could become a reality.\nYou might also like:  [ How a $500 stake in XYZVerse might transform over time ](https://crypto.news/how-a-500-stake-in-xyzverse-might-transform-over-time/)\n## Unlocking the power of POL\nThe Polygon Ecosystem Token ([POL](https://crypto.news/price/pol-ex-matic/)) is more than just a digital asset; it’s the lifeblood of the expansive Polygon network. As a utility token, POL plays a crucial role in the network’s operations. Holders can stake their tokens, helping to secure the system while earning rewards. This process encourages community participation and strengthens the overall health of the network.\nBeyond staking, POL gives its holders a voice in the future of Polygon. By voting on proposals, they influence important decisions and the direction of the network’s development. Additionally, POL unlocks access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem, offering unique benefits to its community. As Polygon continues to grow and add more applications, the significance of POL in the digital landscape becomes even more prominent.\n## Polkadot: Connecting the crypto world\nPolkadot is a cryptocurrency that brings different blockchains together. It lets users send value or data from Bitcoin to Ethereum without middlemen. Using parachains, it boosts speed and scalability, making transactions much faster than on Bitcoin or Ethereum. \nThe [DOT](https://crypto.news/price/polkadot/) token is key to this system. Holders can vote on changes and help verify transactions, keeping the network democratic. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its unique approach to blockchain limitations. While Bitcoin and Ethereum laid the groundwork, Polkadot builds bridges between them. This connectivity is vital as the crypto world grows more complex. With its focus on speed and governance, it offers something different from other cryptocurrencies. \n## Conclusion\nThough POL and DOT are solid, XYZVerse’s blend of sports and memes could see it surpass them in 2025’s bull run as the next crypto icon.\nTo learn more about XYZVerse, visit the [website](https://xyzverse.io/?utm_source=CRNS&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=RU304M3), [Telegram](https://t.me/xyzverse), and \nRead more:  [ How to buy XYZVerse: Simple guide and forecast for the first all-sports memecoin ](https://crypto.news/how-to-buy-xyzverse-simple-guide-and-forecast-for-the-first-all-sports-memecoin/)\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) shorts accounted for $321 million in liquidations. At the same time, open interest increased by 5% to $133 billion, indicating that new leveraged bets are entering the market.The average crypto relative strength index has also risen to 70, signaling overbought conditions.\nThe spike in liquidations followed a rapid market rebound. With risk-on sentiment returning to international markets, the total value of the crypto market reached $3.3 trillion, its highest level since early March. \nBitcoin reached a peak of $103,460 during Friday’s Asian trading hours, up more than 6% in the past day. Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)) led the altcoin surge, climbing over 20% to reclaim $2,200 for the first time in two months, while Solana ([SOL](https://crypto.news/price/solana/)) and XRP ([XRP](https://crypto.news/price/xrp/)) gained 8% and 5%, respectively.\nA tentative U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that President Donald Trump [hinted](https://crypto.news/bitcoin-approaches-100k-as-trump-teases-major-trade-deal-with-big-country/) at on May 8 sparked the rally and gave international markets new hope. This is the case even though the Federal Reserve did not [change](https://crypto.news/dow-jones-major-indices-rise-as-fed-holds-rates-steady-powell-warns-of-trade-and-inflation-risks/) interest rates on Wednesday, May 6. But according to the CME FedWatch [tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), markets are pricing in a 70% chance of a rate cut by July and a 95% chance of at least one cut by October.\nYou might also like: \nOn-chain data also shows that Bitcoin investors are becoming more confident. Bitcoin’s Realized Cap reached a new all-time high of $890.7 billion, its third consecutive weekly record, according to a May 8 [post](https://t.co/mk4ssYDNQM) on X by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán. \nThis measure, which reflects the total amount of capital invested in Bitcoin based on its most recent price movement, points to a sustained accumulation trend by both short- and long-term holders.\nWhile sentiment remains bullish, some caution is warranted. Santiment reported that Bitcoin’s break above the $100K “psychological level” is drawing significant retail attention. However, the firm warned that excessive bullish sentiment can often mark local tops.\nMeanwhile, Real Vision’s CEO Raoul Pal that BTC dominance might have peaked, citing DeMark indicators. If accurate, this might signal the beginning of what he refers to as the “Banana Zone,” a period of outsized gains in altcoins.

It also posted a net loss of $134.3 million, a stark reversal from the $250.7 million in profit recorded during the same period last year.\nAccording to CEO Asher Genoot, the decline stems from the cumulative effects of the last [Bitcoin halving](https://crypto.news/5-things-weve-learned-since-the-bitcoin-halving/), which cut mining rewards in half. While the halving itself took place last April, its financial impact has only recently fully set in for mining companies, including [Hut 8](https://crypto.news/tag/hut-8/). \nAs a result, reduced revenue per mined coin, coupled with increased operational downtime related to ongoing upgrades of mining hardware, have squeezed Hut 8’s margins and pushed the company deep into the red.\nYou might also like:  [ News Trump family joins forces with Hut 8 to launch Bitcoin mining venture ](https://crypto.news/trump-family-joins-forces-with-hut-8-to-launch-bitcoin-mining-venture/)\nDespite the current headwinds in the mining sector, Hut 8 is pushing forward with an ambitious new initiative. During the company’s latest earnings call on Thursday, Genoot reiterated that its new mining venture [American Bitcoin Corp](https://crypto.news/trump-family-joins-forces-with-hut-8-to-launch-bitcoin-mining-venture/). will go public.\nHut 8 announced it’s launching American Bitcoin Corp. after it has acquired a majority stake in American Data Centers Inc., a company backed by Donald Trump’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. \nThe market responded positively to the announcement, with Hut 8 shares surging 17% on the day. \nMeanwhile, Hut 8 continues to develop computing infrastructure to support AI workloads, particularly at its sites in Louisiana. This move reflects a growing industry trend in which Bitcoin miners are [diversifying](https://crypto.news/riot-platforms-explores-ai-revenue-diversification-as-bitcoin-network-transactions-hover-at-12-months-low/) into AI and high-performance computing to mitigate the financial strain caused by reduced block rewards following the halving.\nYou might also like:  [ Argo Blockchain posts $3.4m mining revenue despite dip in Bitcoin output ](https://crypto.news/argo-blockchain-posts-3-4m-mining-revenue-despite-dip-in-bitcoin-output/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Baker, a former Plaid executive and current board member of the Stellar Development Foundation, brings deep fintech and blockchain experience. \nSources say she is helping shape Meta’s stablecoin initiatives internally and is involved in the company’s outreach to crypto partners.\nYou might also like:  [ Binance stablecoin inflows surge, hinting at possible crypto market breakout ](https://crypto.news/binance-stablecoin-inflows-surge-hinting-at-possible-crypto-market-breakout/)\nMeta’s interest in stablecoins comes years after its ill-fated attempt to launch Libra, later renamed Diem. The project [sought to create a global digital currency](https://crypto.news/facebook-diem-launch-stablecoin-pilot-2021/) backed by a basket of fiat currencies and supported by a consortium that included major names like Uber and PayPal.\nHowever, it quickly ran into intense [political and regulatory resistance](https://crypto.news/libra-association-core-model-regulatory/), both in the U.S. and abroad. By early 2022, Meta [abandoned](https://crypto.news/meta-stablecoin-project-diem-sell-off-assets/) the initiative entirely and sold off Diem’s assets to crypto-friendly bank Silvergate.\nStablecoins have gained significant traction since then, especially among fintechs and institutional players, especially in the United States. Under the Trump administration, stablecoins have been [positioned](https://crypto.news/stablecoins-can-secure-u-s-dollar-dominance-trumps-crypto-czar/) as a key element of U.S. financial strategy.\nAs previously reported by crypto.news, Stripe, for example, recently [launched](https://crypto.news/stripe-stablecoin-accounts-go-live-in-over-100-countries/) stablecoin-based financial accounts in over 100 countries on May 7. \nLast month, payments giant Visa [partnered](https://crypto.news/visa-and-bridge-partner-to-make-stablecoins-accessible-for-everyday-purchases/) with Bridge and invested in stablecoin startup BVNK, while Fidelity is developing a stablecoin of its own.\nBut as corporate adoption accelerates, Washington remains divided on how to regulate the booming stablecoin market. \nOn May 8, the U.S. Senate [voted against](https://crypto.news/us-senate-votes-against-genius-act-after-democrat-pushback/) advancing the GENIUS Act, a key piece of legislation aimed at establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The procedural cloture vote failed 48–49, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin formal debate. \nAlthough the bill had previously [cleared the Senate Banking Committee](https://crypto.news/senate-committee-advances-genius-act-in-bipartisan-vote/) with bipartisan support, it ultimately stalled after several Senate Democrats raised last-minute objections. Their concerns focused on the lack of robust protections against illicit financial activity and potential risks associated with stablecoins issued by foreign entities.\nRead more:  [ World Liberty Financial opens vote to airdrop USD1 stablecoin to WLFI holders ](https://crypto.news/world-liberty-financial-opens-vote-to-airdrop-usd1-stablecoin-to-wlfi-holders/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Axelar’s Interchain Token Service will enable developers to deploy smart contracts once and reach users across multiple networks using routers like Squid and wallets like Backpack and SlushWallet. \nAlong with providing institutional-grade security and compliance, the integration makes use of Sui’s ([SUI](https://crypto.news/price/sui/)) zkLogin feature, which enhances the user experience for mainstream onboarding. This move adds to Sui’s latest integrations and partnerships, which already include those with Circle ([USDC](https://crypto.news/price/usd-coin/)), Stacks ([STX](https://crypto.news/price/stacks/)), and Mastercard.\nSUI’s price rallied over 20% in the wake of the announcement but has seen a modest [pullback](https://crypto.news/why-sui-may-pull-back-before-the-next-bullish-expansion/) from its 24-hour high of $4.07. Now trading at $3.86, the asset is still up 6% over the last day, with trading volume surging 119% to $3.3 billion.

The relative strength index, which is at 69, is just below the overbought level, suggesting that momentum is slowing down.\nHowever, SUI is trading comfortably above all of the major moving averages in the 10–200 day range, which continue to support a bullish trend. The MACD remains in positive territory while other momentum indicators, such as the Stochastic RSI, display neutral signals.\nThe [uptrend](https://crypto.news/sui-price-set-to-soar-funding-rate-defi-assets-surge/) might continue if SUI can stay above the $3.70 support level. A decisive move above the recent high could open the door to new levels around $4.40.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "By [Leon Okwatch](https://crypto.news/author/leon-okwatch/)\nMay 9, 2025 at 6:04 AM UTC\nEdited by [Ankish Jain](https://crypto.news/author/ankish-jain/)\nNews\nShare \nEthereum has surged 20% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,209 as of press time, in one of its sharpest short-term moves this year.\nThe rally was backed by a sharp rise in trading activity, especially in the derivatives market, whose volume jumped 184%, as per Coinglass [data](https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/ETH). Open interest in Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)) futures has climbed 20% in the past 24 hours, signaling a wave of fresh capital entering the market. \nRising open interest alongside price usually points to the start of a new trend, as traders build long positions rather than simply covering shorts. Meanwhile, more than $265 million in short positions were liquidated, adding fuel to the upward momentum. \nEven though Ethereum has risen 54% in the last month, it’s down 26% so far this year, but there’s still potential for a recovery if momentum continues. \nThe rally coincides with the ongoing decline in the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value ratio. On a May 8 post on X, analysts at CryptoQuant noted that, based on this ratio, Ethereum is now at its most undervalued level relative to Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) since 2019. \nYou might also like:  [ Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is a game changer, staking infrastructure firm P2P.org explains ](https://crypto.news/ethereums-pectra-upgrade-is-a-game-changer-staking-infrastructure-firm-p2p-org-explains/)\nThe MVRV ratio indicates whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market cap to its realized capitalization, or the average price at which tokens last moved. Currently, the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio has fallen into a historically low range of 0.4–0.8, levels last seen in 2019. In past cycles, such undervaluation zones preceded prolonged ETH outperformance against BTC, including in 2017, 2019, and 2021.\nAlthough the signal appears bullish on paper, macro and on-chain data indicate Ethereum might not be able to easily repeat its past. The current cycle is marked by stagnant network activity, rising token supply, and underperforming ETFs, all of which have a significant effect on ETH’s potential price. \nEthereum’s circulating supply recently hit an all-time high, reversing the previous deflationary trend. Lower mainnet [fees](https://crypto.news/ethereum-fees-drop-to-seven-month-low-as-l2-competition-heats-up/) and a decline in ETH burns have altered its supply dynamics since EIP-1559.

Under the proposed deal, Ripple would be able to resume sales without breaking any securities laws and recover $75 million of the $125 million that was held in escrow. \nThe move comes after a key court ruling in 2023 by Judge Analisa Torres, who found that although sales of XRP ([XRP](https://crypto.news/price/xrp/)) to public exchanges did not violate securities laws, sales to institutional investors did. If approved, the court would release the $125 million civil [penalty](https://crypto.news/ripple-to-drop-cross-appeal-against-sec-to-pay-50m-fine/) held in escrow, with $50 million going to the SEC and the remainder back to Ripple. \nThe settlement explicitly states that neither party will seek to amend the 2023 summary judgment, preserving the court’s finding that only institutional XRP sales violated securities law. However, not everyone within the SEC is on board. \nYou might also like:  [ XRP’s positive 6-month cost basis defies macro weakness but indicators show slowing momentum ](https://crypto.news/xrps-positive-6-month-cost-basis-defies-macro-weakness-but-indicators-show-slowing-momentum/)\nSEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw criticized the settlement as “a tremendous disservice to the investing public” in a strongly worded [dissent](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825) posted on the agency’s website. She argued that it weakens the SEC’s ability to hold crypto companies accountable and sends the wrong message to the market. \nCrenshaw warned that despite the court’s previous decision, the SEC may not take any action if Ripple starts selling XRP to institutions again without registering the tokens. She also expressed concern that this settlement could be part of a broader pullback in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts, which could leave investors less protected.\nDespite this, the SEC insists the agreement is fair and serves the public interest. It pointed to the fact that the case already helped define legal boundaries around token sales, giving the crypto industry more clarity.\nIf the court approves the request, Ripple and the SEC will move to formally dismiss their appeals, [ending](https://crypto.news/sec-wrapping-up-case-against-ripple-could-be-over-soon-report/) one of the longest-running and most closely watched crypto cases to date.

    "content": "By [Aziz Zamani](https://crypto.news/author/aziz-shamsul-khattak/)\nMay 8, 2025 at 7:25 PM UTC\nEdited by [Jayson Derrick](https://crypto.news/author/jayson-derrick/)\nMarkets\nShare \nHyperLiquid has flipped a major resistance level into support at $20, signaling strong bullish momentum. If this level holds, a 41% move toward $29 could be on the horizon.\nAfter a series of consistent higher lows and higher highs, Hyperliquid ([HYPE](https://crypto.news/price/hyperliquid/)) has reclaimed a major technical level: the $20 resistance. This breakout confirms that bulls are in control, with price action positioned above a previously significant ceiling. If this newly established support holds, it could fuel a substantial continuation of the current uptrend.\n## Key technical points:\n  * **Major Resistance Flip** : The $20 level, previously a strong resistance, has now flipped into support.\n  * **Fibonacci Confluence:** The 0.618 Fib retracement aligns perfectly with the $20 SR level, offering strong support in the case of a pullback.\n  * **Next Target:** The next resistance lies at $29 — a 41% potential move from current levels.\n\n\nThe price action has established a new high within this trending structure, essential for maintaining bullish momentum. With a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, the overall structure remains intact. The breakout above $20 not only confirms bullish intent but also clears the way for additional upside — provided the level is respected during any near-term retracements.Should Hyperliquid pull back from current levels, a retest of the $20 region would be expected. Rather than signaling weakness, this would represent a classic bullish SR (support/resistance) flip — a healthy sign in trending markets. The fact that this zone coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement adds further weight to its significance.\nYou might also like:  [ Ethereum price reclaims $2000: is this the start of a major bull run? ](https://crypto.news/ethereum-price-reclaims-2000-is-this-the-start-of-a-major-bull-run/)\nAdding further strength to this scenario is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, which aligns precisely with the $20 support zone. The convergence of horizontal SR and Fibonacci support significantly increases the likelihood of bulls stepping in to defend this level, making a continued rally far more probable.From a risk-reward perspective, this zone presents one of the better setups in current market conditions. A bounce from the $20 region could initiate a rally toward the next resistance at $29. If this level is reached, it would represent a 41% gain — a move that would reinforce Hyperliquid’s momentum and strengthen the overall bullish market structure.\n## What to expect in the coming price action\nIf the $20 support holds during any short-term pullbacks, the bullish structure will remain intact, increasing the likelihood of a move toward $29. Traders should watch for volume spikes and daily candle closes above $20 as key signals of continued strength.\nRead more:  [ Can EOS crypto hit $1 ahead of the final stage of Vaulta rebrand? ](https://crypto.news/can-eos-crypto-hit-1-ahead-of-the-final-stage-of-vaulta-rebrand/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

On May 7, SUI ([SUI](https://crypto.news/price/sui/)) had dropped slightly by 0.41%, but bounced back with momentum as technical indicators shifted, according to crypto.news data. \nThis jump comes as Bitcoin [surpassed](https://crypto.news/what-tariff-shock-bitcoin-surges-past-100k-as-market-recovery-continues/) $100,000 for the first time since February, rebounding sharply from its April crash. Bitcoin has surged 33% in recent weeks alongside a broader market recovery following Trump’s surprise tariff announcements.\nA “golden crossover” between short- and long-term moving averages was observed, often seen as a sign of upward pressure. \nOver the past month, Sui’s DeFi ecosystem [grew rapidly](https://crypto.news/sui-price-set-to-soar-funding-rate-defi-assets-surge/), with $2.45 billion in TVL, rising stablecoin activity, and increased DEX volumes, positioning Sui as the ninth-largest blockchain.\nYou might also like:  [ Ethereum price reclaims $2000: is this the start of a major bull run? ](https://crypto.news/ethereum-price-reclaims-2000-is-this-the-start-of-a-major-bull-run/)\n## What’s next for SUI?\nSUI now faces resistance at $4.36, though the asset has broken through this level on some exchanges.

Decentralized AI | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/big-techs-biggest-nightmare-decentralized-ai-opinion/)\nThe primary goal is to address a growing concern with today’s large language models: their lack of transparency. Currently, users have no insight into how AI systems arrive at specific outputs, nor can they determine whether those outputs stem from machine logic or human input.\n## AI needs to be transparent to grow: Nexus\nThe opacity of AI systems is a particular concern in regulated industries. In industries such as healthcare, finance, etc, corporate users have to know where the training data is coming from, and how the model generates its outputs. \n> “Modern AI systems are powerful — but opaque. We rarely know exactly what data they were trained on, which version was deployed, or whether the output we see was actually generated by the model we tested. In regulated domains like healthcare, finance, and law, this opacity is a dealbreaker,” **Nexus** wrote\nNexus’s efforts showcase the growing convergence between AI and blockchain technologies. In particular, blockchain systems can provide the transparency and open-source nature that current AI models lack. \nWhat is more, Nexus is just one of the companies working on verifiable AI. For instance, Oasis Protocol launched its [verifiable AI agents](https://crypto.news/exclusive-oasis-protocol-unveils-verifiable-ai-agents-for-crypto-trading/) on April 29. With these agents, users can independently verify how they is they are applying the correct trading strategy. \nRead more:  [ Open-source AI isn’t the end-all game—Bringing AI onchain is | Opinion ](https://crypto.news/open-source-ai-isnt-the-endgame-bringing-ai-onchain-is/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Trump later learned that the message had been drafted by a lobbyist affiliated with Ballard Partners, a firm whose clients include Ripple Labs, the company most closely associated with XRP.\nTwo anonymous sources told Politico that a Ballard employee handed Trump the draft during a donor event at Mar-a-Lago and encouraged him to publicly support the digital assets.\nUnaware of the lobbyist’s affiliations, Trump reportedly posted the message without knowing the full context.\nYou might also like:  [ What tariff shock?

The firm reportedly brought in $14 million in lobbying revenue in Q1 2025 and represents high-profile clients including TikTok and BMW.\nFollowing the incident, however, Ballard has reportedly been frozen out of Trump’s orbit, with staff instructed to avoid meetings with the firm.\nBallard has pushed back on the narrative. In a statement to Politico, he said the firm is “accustomed to false accusations” and denied leveraging his relationship with Trump for business. Still, some close to the president believe the fallout was inevitable. “One way to get yourself in the doghouse is for the president to think you’re trading on his name,” a Trump confidant said.\nWhile Trump [later clarified](https://crypto.news/crypto-market-trumps-crypto-strategic-reserve/) that Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) and Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)) would also be included in any strategic reserve, the damage had been done. \nThe White House declined to comment on the matter.

This development will allow DAIS to contribute to the buildout of key Internet of [AI](https://crypto.news/tag/ai/) infrastructure, with the ANFE seeding an endowment for the Society.\nThe partnership comes as Hypercycle joins DAIS as a member. The collaboration was unveiled at the [Bermuda Digital Finance Forum](https://www.digitalfinanceforum.com/), an event co-hosted by DAIS, digital asset advisory firm Penrose Partners, and the Bermuda government.\n> “This arrangement with Hypercycle and CETI brings unique advantages to DAIS and its members,” said DAIS chairman Michael Casey. “Not only will the CETI-hosted ANFE secure a growing source of funding to help the Society expand its mission, but it will serve as a window into how the internet of AI is evolving as an economy, offering an important learning opportunity for our community.”\nYou might also like:  [ SWEAT wallet launches personalised AI agent and goes multichain ](https://crypto.news/sweat-wallet-launches-personalised-ai-agent-and-goes-multichain/)\nCETI AI will host and run the yield-earning [node](https://crypto.news/tag/nodes/) factory, enabling DAIS to access Hypercycle’s decentralized network and its peer-to-peer exchange of intelligence, compute, and funding. These masternodes earn fees and create a continuous funding source for the Society.\nHypercycle will support DAIS’s traction in the decentralized AI space, the platform’s chief executive officer Toufi Saliba. \n> “Our model, by enabling and incentivizing value exchange across siloed AI systems, helps manifest that vision through an open, collaborative Internet of AI. We’re thrilled that DAIS and its members are directly engaging with us to help get there,” the Hypercycle chief executive noted.\nDAIS is taking advantage of a small window that runs out on May 14 to integrate into the Hypercycle network. This narrow window allows existing Hypercycle node factory operators on Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)) to opt in and leverage their assets in the parallel network of the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Base blockchain. \nIt allows operators to add a host of software enhancements with ANFE configuration, with complete interoperability and zero disruption.\nYou might also like:  [ Space and Time launches ZK mainnet to power smart contract data ](https://crypto.news/space-and-time-launches-zk-mainnet-to-power-smart-contract-data/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

On Thursday, May 7, the token was up 11.83%, reaching $0.4622, driven by both market momentum and ecosystem growth.\nAltcoin momentum has started to pick up, as Bitcoin [(BTC)](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/) broke above the $100,000 mark. The Altcoin Season Index reached its highest level since February, with 33 out of the top 100 altcoins in the green over the past 30 days.\nNotably, Jupiter was not among the best performers during that period. In fact, it was one of the worst, losing 44% of its value over the past 90 days. Still, the strength of Solana’s ecosystem—where Jupiter continues to maintain dominance, is fueling renewed optimism.\n## Jupiter rises on Solana DeFi Growth\nPart of the reason why Jupiter is recovering is thanks to the growth of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. The surge coincided with Solana’s DEX volume [breaking $800 billion](https://crypto.news/solanas-dex-volume-breaks-800b-milestone-in-2025/) so far in 2025. While more than half of this volume was in January, trading volumes remained consistent so far this year. \nYou might also like:  [ Solana price target: Expert predicts $180–$200 breakout ](https://crypto.news/solana-price-target-expert-predicts-180-200-breakout/)\nThis benefits Jupiter, which maintains a dominant position among Solana-based applications. So far in 2025, its DEX aggregator has accounted for 42%, or $334 billion, of all DEX volume on the chain. Raydium was a distant second, handling 23.48% of the total.\nMoreover, [Jupiter controls 95%](https://app.blockworksresearch.com/unlocked/jupiter-scale-synergies-and-scrutiny) of the market share among DEX aggregators on Solana. As the most popular DeFi app in the ecosystem, Jupiter is well positioned to benefit from Solana’s continued recovery and expanding user base. If ecosystem growth persists, the JUP token is likely to follow.\nRead more:  [ LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt ](https://crypto.news/libra-solana-jupiter-meteora-scandal/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

    "content": "By [Aziz Zamani](https://crypto.news/author/aziz-shamsul-khattak/)\nMay 8, 2025 at 5:30 PM UTC\nEdited by [Jayson Derrick](https://crypto.news/author/jayson-derrick/)\nMarkets\nShare \nEthereum has surged past the critical $2,000 psychological and technical level after an explosive move from $1,800 support. This breakout could mark the beginning of a major rally toward $2,820, a 40% upside potential if momentum holds.\nAfter weeks of range-bound consolidation, Ethereum ([ETH](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)) has finally broken through the highly contested $2,000 resistance. This level has acted as a psychological ceiling for several months, and reclaiming it marks a significant shift in short-term market structure. The move was triggered by a strong reaction at the $1,800 support zone, and now all eyes are on the next major resistance level at $2,820.\n## Key technical points\n  * **Support Bounce:** Ethereum surged off the $1,800 support, igniting a fresh bullish wave.\n  * **Break Above Resistance:** ETH reclaimed the key $2,000 level, confirming strength in price action.\n  * **Next Target:** The next major resistance sits at $2,820 — roughly 40% above current levels.\n\n\nEthereum’s breakout above $2,000 is both a technical and psychological milestone. It represents a reclaim of control by bulls after weeks of uncertainty and sideways movement. More importantly, the move was supported by a strong foundation: multiple higher lows formed during consolidation, showing growing demand and buyer interest at increasingly higher levels. The $1,800 support held firm and acted as a springboard for this rally, with price slicing through $2,000 on strong momentum.To sustain this breakout, Ethereum needs to secure daily candle closes above the $2,000 level. So far, the current structure shows a clear bullish trend, a higher low, followed by a higher high, and now an attempt to stabilize above resistance. \nIf this level is converted into solid support, it could act as a launchpad for price to accelerate toward the $2,820 resistance, the next major technical barrier on the chart. This level has acted as resistance in previous cycles and could be a critical test for bulls if reached.\nYou might also like:  [ Solana price target: Expert predicts $180–$200 breakout ](https://crypto.news/btc-holds-above-100k-as-markets-soar-can-pepe-shiba-or-pepeto-be-the-next-100x-memecoins/)\nA short-term rejection here wouldn’t necessarily reverse the trend. If price pulls back and forms another higher low above the $1,800–$1,900 range, it would reinforce the ongoing bullish structure. Such a move would likely reset momentum and attract fresh buyers, giving Ethereum a stronger foundation for a future breakout. Consolidation near $2,000 should be expected, and even welcomed, as it can provide the market with structure and continuation strength.\n## What to expect in the coming price action\nEthereum’s ability to hold above $2,000 in the coming days will be critical. If bulls manage multiple daily closes above this level, the path toward $2,820 becomes increasingly probable.\nEven a minor pullback forming a higher low would maintain the bullish bias, suggesting that Ethereum is positioning itself for a broader upside continuation in the weeks ahead.\nRead more:  [ How high can Pepe price jump after flipping key resistance? ](https://crypto.news/how-high-can-pepe-price-jump-after-flipping-key-resistance/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Its futures open interest also soared to $475 million, the highest point since January.\nPepe Coin price jumped as the crypto fear and greed index moved to the greed zone, following Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) move above $100,000. Most altcoins continued rising, with Bitcoin moving above the psychological point at $2,000.\nYou might also like:  [ Trump Coin price prediction: Will it rise or fall after the exclusive dinner? ](https://crypto.news/trump-coin-price-prediction-will-it-rise-or-fall-after-the-exclusive-dinner/)\nThe rally happened after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and embraced a wait-and-see approach. Also, it rallied after [Coinbase acquired Deribit](https://crypto.news/coinbase-to-acquire-deribit-for-2-9b-in-largest-deal-yet-report/)**,** one of the biggest players in the futures and options industry. \nInternally, there are signs that Pepe investors are not dumping their tokens as exchange balances have dropped. All tokens on exchanges dropped slightly in the last seven days and currently stand at 255.16 trillion, down from 255.2 trillion last week.\n## Pepe price technical analysis\nThe coin’s surge also happened for technical analysis.

This pattern comprises two descending and converging trendlines and often leads to a bullish breakout. \nMost recently, Pepe price formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.0000057. It has now jumped above the neckline at $0.0000095. \nThe distance between the double-bottom and the neckline is about 62%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline brings the Pepr Coin price target at $0.00001545, up by 55% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.0000759 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nYou might also like:  [ Can EOS crypto hit $1 ahead of the final stage of Vaulta rebrand? ](https://crypto.news/can-eos-crypto-hit-1-ahead-of-the-final-stage-of-vaulta-rebrand/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

The gains had Uniswap in vertical mode amid a spik in daily volume, with the altcoin seeing more than $214 million traded in the past 24 hours to represent a 70% increase.\nBitcoin’s rally to $100,000 could provide new momentum. However, analysts at market intelligence platform Santiment caution that it could be a “double-edged sword.”\n> “On one hand, retail FOMO can add a bit of extra fuel to this rally as major media outlets spam Bitcoin’s 3-month milestone and bring in many new entries to the space. On the other hand, we typically see rallies put on the brakes when there is an overwhelming amount of calls related to ‘higher’ or ‘above’ (in relation to crypto) like we’re seeing now,” Santiment .\nAlthough UNI gains align with the broader market’s uptick catalyzing bullish sentiment, tailwinds include the recent Ethereum [Pectra upgrade](https://crypto.news/pectra-went-live-why-didnt-eth-price-rally/). \nRead more:  [ What tariff shock?

The surge also came alongside a sharp rise in volume processed by its decentralized exchange protocols.\nEOS ([EOS](https://crypto.news/price/eos/)) rose to a high of $0.850, up 95% from its April lows, pushing its market cap to $1.3 billion. The rally occurred in a high-volume environment, with daily trading volume jumping by 67% to $428 million.\nEOS jumped after the developers announced that the full [rebrand to Vaulta](https://crypto.news/eos-crypto-rebrands-as-vaulta-chart-points-to-quadruple-bottom/) will happen on May 14. The ticker symbol will also change from EOS to just A. The gains followed the announcement that EOS will fully rebrand to Vaulta on May 14, with its ticker symbol changing from EOS to A.\nVaulta aims to become a major player in blockchain-based banking. The platform will offer programmable contracts and settlement layers, enabling banks and fintech companies to launch scalable, cross-border financial services.\nThe team compares Vaulta’s ambition to that of Stripe, the payments giant that helps businesses accept online payments. However, Vaulta’s focus is on making it easier for traditional financial firms to tap into blockchain without needing deep technical expertise.\nYou might also like:  [ EOS price soars 25% on Vaulta rebranding news ](https://crypto.news/eos-price-soars-25-on-vaulta-rebranding-news/)\nVaulta also hopes to become a major player in the real-world asset tokenization industry. In this, it will provide companies in the wealth and asset management industries with the technology they need to tokenize assets into digital tokens. \nThe EOS token also jumped after third-party data showed that the volume handled in its DEX protocols rose in the last 7 days. They handled tokens worth $$86.7 million, bringing the 30-day volume to $158 million. \nEOS price also rose as the weighted funding rate turned positive and reached its highest level since Tuesday. A positive rate means that long traders are paying short sellers. It happens when the price of a perpetual contract is above the current price.\n## EOS price technical analysis\nThe 8-hour chart shows that EOS continued to climb, reaching $0.85—its highest since April 4. The token has broken above the ascending trendline that connects the key swing lows since March 11.\nIt also sits above the 50-period moving average, while several momentum oscillators are trending higher. The price is now approaching a key resistance level at $0.8770, which was the April 3 peak.\nA breakout above this resistance could open the door to more gains, with the next major target being the psychological level at $1.00, about 20% higher than current levels.\nYou might also like:  [ Trump Coin price prediction: Will it rise or fall after the exclusive dinner? ](https://crypto.news/trump-coin-price-prediction-will-it-rise-or-fall-after-the-exclusive-dinner/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

    "content": "By [David Marsanic](https://crypto.news/author/david-marsanic/)\nMay 8, 2025 at 4:24 PM UTC\nEdited by [Jayson Derrick](https://crypto.news/author/jayson-derrick/)\nNews\nShare \nSolana saw a major rally today, with signs suggesting it could soon see another breakout to $200. \nSolana [(SOL)](https://crypto.news/price/solana/) saw a major rally on Thursday, May 8, with signs suggesting another breakout to $200 could be on the horizon. Backed by rising DeFi activity, strong market sentiment, and network upgrades, SOL jumped 10.02% to $160.32, its highest level since March 3.\nThe surge coincided with a major milestone for Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. On Wednesday, May 7, DeFi volumes on the Solana network [broke $800 billion](https://crypto.news/solanas-dex-volume-breaks-800b-milestone-in-2025/) in 2025. While over half of that came in January, continued strength in recent months points to sustained investor interest in the ecosystem.\nYou might also like:  [ Solana upgrade raises block capacity by 20%, improves developer tools ](https://crypto.news/solana-upgrade-raises-block-capacity-by-20-improves-developer-tools/)\nThis activity suggests that the SOL rally will likely continue, Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, told crypto.news. If SOL maintains the current level, the token could go as high as $180 or $200. \n> “Solana’s current price action suggests a wide accumulation range that is often seen in assets transitioning from a growth phase into a more mature market position. Bulls are now eyeing a breakout above the key $153 resistance level. If this level flips into support and momentum persists, this could open the path towards $180 and potentially $200 soon after,” Tracy Jin, MEXC\n## Investors now see Solana differently: COO of MEXC\nBeyond the market momentum, Jin believes that there is a “fundamental shift” in how the markets perceive Solana. The growth of its ecosystem, together with the relative weakness of Ethereum, is now attracting institutions to SOL. \n> “Ethereum ETFs have bled more than $350 million year-to-date. Solana has been the dominant network among L1 and L2 chains in 2025, driven by the rise of platforms like Pump.fun, radium, and Axiom,” Tracy Jin, MEXC\nJin added that the upcoming launches of Solana ETFs will further boost its institutional appeal. They will be attracted to the value the Solana network is creating through its DeFi ecosystem. \nRead more:  [ ‘Real equities to DeFi’: Superstate to bring public equity trading on Solana ](https://crypto.news/real-equities-to-defi-superstate-to-bring-public-equity-trading-on-solana/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

    "content": "By [Alexey Borovets](https://crypto.news/author/alexey-borovets/)\nMay 8, 2025 at 4:20 PM UTC\nEdited by [Anna Akopian](https://crypto.news/author/anna-akopian/)\nFeature\nShare \nThe Financial Times analyst noticed that millions of dollars’ worth of MELANIA memetoken were bought minutes before the launch. Investigation reveals the details of the purchases and estimates combined profits at $99.6 million. \nThe MELANIA token was launched on Jan. 19, 2025, two days after the launch of the Official Trump token and only one day before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Lack of transparency, conflict of interests, and emphasis on the gambling aspect of cryptocurrencies are only a few reasons why the Trump pair’s tokens launch caused displeasure in the crypto community. Both $TRUMP and $MELANIA are Solana-based memecoins with little to no use case.\nTable of Contents\n## What is known about pre-launch sales?\nThe token launch was announced by Melania Trump on Truth Social on Jan. 19. Digesting the blockchain data, an FT analyst [noticed](https://www.ft.com/content/f5797d16-6299-444c-b990-5cbc6a7ccfca?utm_source=unchainedcrypto.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pectra-goes-live-ethereum-s-game-changing-upgrade-hits-mainnet) that two and a half minutes before the post went live, 24 wallets received $2.6 million worth of $MELANIA. They bought 16,700,000 out of 200,000,000 $MELANIA, or 33.4% of the total supply. The holders of these wallets remain unknown.\nAs the token launch announcement was published, the $MELANIA price skyrocketed. Within the following 12 hours, investors who bought the token cheap before the launch sold 81% of their holdings.\nOne specific account invested $681,000 in $MELANIA in a single transaction just a minute before the first announcement of the memecoin launch. Selling most of the $MELANIA tokens the same day, the investor enjoyed $39 million in profits. Within the following three days, they gained $4.4 million more.\nAccording to FT, the wallets participating in pre-launch purchases don’t belong to the MELANIA team, which allegedly fixed profits at $64,700,000.\nAlthough this purchase can’t be called 100% fair, it doesn’t break the law protecting the securities investors as memecoins do not qualify as securities in the U.S. Clarifying the legal status of memecoins which saw a boom at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025, the SEC’s [guidance](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins) issued in February 2025 noted that these tokens are “more akin to collectibles” and the laws regulating securities do not apply to them.\nRead more:  [ SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance says memecoins are not securities ](https://crypto.news/secs-division-of-corporation-finance-says-memecoins-are-not-securities)\n## The team behind $MELANIA\nOfficially, the First Lady’s memecoin is managed by her Florida-registered company, MKT World LLC. Melania Trump has used this firm since 2021 for various enterprises. The exact role of MKT World in MELANIA memecoin is not clear, though. According to the [Melania Meme website](https://melaniameme.com/), the team owns 30% of the supply, while 30% is held in the treasury, 20% is intended for the community, and the remaining 20% is available for public use.\nThe team behind the MELANIA memecoin [was suspected](https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-3-643904-20250217) of sniping various memecoins after capitalizing on the MELANIA token. Sniping refers to using automated tools to make instant purchases of fresh memecoins before their prices go up. According to the report released in February, the MELANIA team made $2.4 million through sniping the First Lady-themed memecoin. \nAccording to Bubblemaps analysts, the address used for it is allegedly associated with other successful sniping operations. The 0xcEAe address was used to withdraw $2.4 million after MELANIA sniping and distribute it between the Avalanche and Arbitrum addresses. The same address is associated with $LIBRA token sniping. On top of that, Bubblemaps analysts associate involved addresses with multiple pump-and-dump operations.\n## $MELANIA vs $TRUMP\nThe FT report emphasizes that the story of the MELANIA token is different from the story of Official Trump. The latter token was launched by a different team and grossed $350 million through fees and token sales. \nThe latest data from Chainalysis indicates that after the launch of the Official Trump memecoin, 58 wallets [gained $10 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html) in $TRUMP each. The total profit amounted to $1.1 billion. The same report reveals that around 764,000 wallets, holding mostly small amounts of $TRUMP, lost money as a result of investment. The total number of wallets involved in the $TRUMP investment is estimated at two million. Reportedly, 80% of the token’s supply is controlled by the team behind the token.\nDifferent price trajectories of these tokens differently affected the holdings belonging to the teams–holdings of the $TRUMP team get bigger as the price enjoys occasional spikes. In contrast, the $MELANIA price has been pretty low all the time since it dropped shortly after the launch. As of press time, $MELANIA is traded at around 32 cents, 97% below its ATH, which was $13.73 on the very first day on the market.\n## Conclusion\nSolana tokens, launched by the Trumps not long before the inauguration, leave a bitter taste. Some see these memecoins as a convenient way to bribe top officials by foreign entities, while others believe these tokens were made for insider trading. \nBoth projects lack transparency, but it’s clear that the identification of holders of these 24 wallets may be lucrative for Donald Trump’s political enemies. \nYou might also like:  [ Melania meme coin team dumps 9.99m tokens in 8 days, nets 170k SOL so far ](https://crypto.news/melania-meme-coin-team-dumps-9-99m-tokens-in-8-days)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Shiba Inu gained global recognition for turning tiny investments into massive gains, skyrocketing over 80,000,000% from its starting price to its peak, establishing itself as a crypto legend. \nPepe followed suit with a sharp rise that placed it among the top memecoins, rewarding early holders with impressive returns. However, both tokens now appear to have limited growth potential. Shiba Inu’s market cap sits in the billions, and Pepe remains near its highs, making it harder to expect another explosive run.\nThis shift has brought new attention to Pepeto. Still in its presale, Pepeto is generating buzz with its engaging storyline, growing community, and tangible use cases through the Pepeto Exchange and no-fee PepetoSwap. Priced at just $0.000000127 per token, Pepeto presents a rare opportunity for early entry.

According to Pepeto’s story, Pepe made waves by adopting only a portion of the original plan, using four main values: Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, but missing two key factors: Technology and Optimisation.\nPepeto presents itself as the complete vision, aiming to create real long-term value and practical use cases that elevate it above typical memecoins. With the Pepeto Exchange and no-fee PepetoSwap in progress, Pepeto is shaping up to be a stronger and more forward-looking project than both Shiba and Pepe. As hype builds, many believe Pepeto has the potential to rival or even outdo the gains of Shiba and Pepe.\nPresales like Pepeto’s highlight why early entry can be a game-changer, lower price, more potential, and a vision backed by real tools.\n## **PEPETO presale enters its final stretch ahead of exchange launch**\nInvestors can still secure PEPETO at the presale rate of $0.000000127 on pepeto.io. Supported payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\nWith PepetoSwap development nearly complete and listing announcements underway, early buyers are positioned to benefit from staking rewards and early access to the expanding ecosystem.

The rally is being fueled by strong technical support and renewed bullish momentum.\nThe recent pump in Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) price is no accident.

With higher lows forming week after week, the bullish market structure has remained intact, laying the groundwork for the explosive move we’re seeing today.\n## Key technical points:\n  * **Support confirmed at $94,300:** Strong daily candle closes and wick rejections show buyer demand\n  * **Bullish market structure intact:** Higher lows throughout the consolidation period hint at continuation\n  * **Key resistance ahead at $101,200:** Final major level before a potential breakout into new all-time highs\n\n\nBitcoin’s recent price behavior shows a textbook bullish reaction at support. The $94,244–$94,300 zone has been tested multiple times, with price wicks dipping below only to be aggressively bought up, a strong indication of demand. These repeated defenses have boosted trader confidence, solidifying the area as a springboard for higher prices. The market responded with a swift expansion, clearing local resistances and pushing toward the $100,000 zone.Adding further strength is the broader weekly structure. Each week during the recent consolidation has formed a higher low, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This consistent structure, paired with sustained closes above the $94,300 region, suggests accumulation and readiness for a breakout. Traders who spotted these bullish cues likely positioned early, fueling the current momentum.\nYou might also like:  [ BingX unveils ChainSpot: A CeDeFi innovation for simpler and safer on-chain trading ](https://crypto.news/bingx-unveils-chainspot-a-cedefi-innovation-for-simpler-and-safer-on-chain-trading/)\nNow, Bitcoin is testing the $101,200 resistance, arguably the last line of defense for bears before new all-time highs are in play. This level carries historical significance and acts as a key high-timeframe resistance. Given the velocity of this rally, a direct breakout may not occur immediately. \nInstead, it’s more likely that Bitcoin enters a consolidation phase, forming a new range between $94,300 and $101,200.\n## What to expect in the coming price action\nFollowing such a strong rally, rotational consolidation between $94,300 and $101,200 is likely. If bulls maintain control above $94,300 and absorb selling pressure near $101,000, the chances of a breakout into price discovery increase significantly. Until then, traders should monitor volume and candle structure within this range, any breakout from here could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move.\nRead more:  [ Missouri tax bill exempts crypto and stock gains from income tax ](https://crypto.news/bingx-unveils-chainspot-a-cedefi-innovation-for-simpler-and-safer-on-chain-trading/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

However, a market correction has caused the BTC price to drop to around $99K despite the surge in institutional purchases. Pi Network (PI) has also moved similarly, falling to around $0.63 after a fake Pi Network news hit the community. \nMeanwhile, a new Payment Finance (PayFi) token called [Remittix](https://remittix-organization.gitbook.io/remittix) has been the shining star in the altcoin market lately, raising over $14.7 million during its presale. Investors are tipping the new altcoin to outperform Ripple’s XRP this year. Let’s find out why.\nYou might also like:  [ Cardano, Dogecoin, and Remittix feature as analysts pick most undervalued cryptos ](https://crypto.news/cardano-dogecoin-and-remittix-feature-as-analysts-pick-most-undervalued-cryptos/)\n## **Remittix set to explode with PayFi features**\nThe [Remittix](https://crypto.news/xrp-gears-up-for-breakout-as-whale-activity-soars-for-ripple-remittix/) presale has taken the market by storm after reaching a milestone of over $14.7 million in a few months. The fast presale speed has caused analysts to tip the Remittix presale as the biggest this year, and investors have been purchasing RTX tokens in massive numbers. \nThese investors are backing Remittix early because of its massive potential for short-term and long-term gains. In the short term, the RTX token has seen its value increase across the presale stages, returning decent ROI to the earliest investors. Similarly, long-term investors are optimistic about the project’s promising future, especially after the RTX token gets listed on major exchanges. \nOne major driver for Remittix’s success in the future is its utility in the PayFi space. Currently, the sector is plagued with challenges like the availability of only crypto-to-crypto transactions and no support for traditional banking features. However, Remittix is solving these issues with its solution called the Remittix API, which enables direct crypto-to-fiat transactions. \nWith the Remittix API, users can make direct bank payments using cryptocurrencies and have the recipients get the funds in 30+ fiat currencies. Global businesses can also extend their products and services to crypto enthusiasts who prefer using digital assets for online payments and remittances. This is why some investors believe RTX would outshine established coins like BTC, XRP, and PI over the coming months. \n## **Bitcoin price****meets resistance at $97,000**\nThe Bitcoin price has been moving between a support level of around $92,000 and a resistance level of around $99,000. Despite the late April breakout that sparked a mini bull run, the current BTC price movements show that a breakout through one of these levels will determine the next direction for BTC.\nNonetheless, Bitcoin maxis like Strategy founder, Michael Saylor and other BTC bulls are optimistic that the BTC price is set for bigger gains in the coming months, especially since it’s still holding to its month-on-month gains worth nearly 20%. \n## **Pi Coin****crashes after unverified news**\nIn the past month, PI has seen its trading volume surge by over 30%, indicating investors’ strong demand for the altcoin. However, recent Pi Network news has impacted the PI price, which has now dropped by nearly 4% within the same month. \nFor context, the PI price dropped from over $0.7 to around $0.5 after a fake news article stating that PI had partnered with BNP Paribas to build a Pi Nexus Banking System. However, the PI community remains hopeful that the token would maintain its recent bullish move instead of crashing further. \n## Conclusion \nWhile PI and BTC battle the ongoing market correction, Remittix is flying and tipped for bigger gains this year. Buy RTX in presale for $0.0757 before it increases. \nTo learn more about Remittix, [visit the Remittix presale](https://remittix.io/) and [join the online community.](https://linktr.ee/remittix)\nRead more:  [ XRP gears up for breakout as whale activity soars for Ripple, Remittix ](https://crypto.news/xrp-gears-up-for-breakout-as-whale-activity-soars-for-ripple-remittix/)\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

This rebound pushed its market cap to over $2.46 billion. \nThe rally coincided with Bitcoin ([BTC](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/)) crossing the $100,000 milestone and the total crypto market cap climbing 2% to reach $3.2 trillion.\nTRUMP’s latest upswing also comes as the market anticipates an exclusive dinner event with President Trump at his Virginia golf club. Over 200 of the top TRUMP holders are expected to attend, with the 25 largest holders receiving a VIP tour.\nThe event has sparked backlash from Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who accuse Trump of monetizing his presidency. Several Democrats have pledged to pursue impeachment if they retake the House or Senate in the midterms.\nYou might also like:  [ Trump faces impeachment call and ethics probe over private dinner for TRUMP memecoin holders ](https://crypto.news/trump-faces-impeachment-call-and-ethics-probe-over-private-dinner-for-trump-memecoin-holders/)\nA key issue is that many of the top holders are foreigners. A study by [Bloomberg noted](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-memecoin-foreign-crypto-traders/?srnd=homepage-americas) that 56% of the leaderboard were foreigners as they used foreign exchanges not allowed in the US, like Binance, OKX, and Bybit.\nThere are chances that the Trump Coin price will continue rising ahead of the dinner as more investors buy it, hoping to take part and meet the president.\nHowever, there are substantial risks that may push it to drop before and after the dinner. The most notable risk is that Trump postpones the dinner to a later date, possibly after receiving counsel from his lawyers.\nTrump has a long history of postponing major issues to later dates. For example, after announcing his [Liberation Day tariffs](https://crypto.news/crypto-markets-recoil-in-the-wake-of-liberation-day-tariffs/)**,** he postponed most of them for three months. He has also postponed the TikTok ban as he is engineering a sale for the Chinese social media company.\nThe other risk is that many investors will start selling the coin before and after the dinner. Those who miss the dinner invitation will likely sell ahead of it, while some of the buyers will dump after it happens, in a process known as buying the rumor _and selling the news._\nYou might also like:  [ TRUMP coin soars 73% on dinner hype — but July’s unlocks could tell a very different story ](https://crypto.news/trump-coin-surges-on-dinner-invitation-hype/)\n## Trump Coin price prediction \nAccording to the eight-hour chart, TRUMP hit a bottom at $7.13 in April, surged to $16.41 on April 26, and then pulled back to $10.30 before rebounding again.\nTRUMP has now moved above the 25-period moving average and broken out of a small falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern\nThis suggests the token may retest the $16.41 level, potentially forming a double top. A retracement could follow, especially in the days around the exclusive dinner.\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

This principle states that not only are we not at the center of the Universe, there is no center at all. It also assumes the Universe is isotropic, meaning it looks the same in every direction, and homogeneous, meaning matter is distributed evenly on large scales.\nThese ideas form the foundation of the Standard Model of Cosmology, our best framework for understanding the origin, structure, and evolution of the Universe. While this model is supported by extensive evidence, it remains a work in progress.\nHowever, recent observations suggest there may be subtle irregularities—anisotropies—at the largest cosmic scales. These include inconsistencies in how fast the Universe is expanding, unusual patterns in the cosmic microwave background, and other unexplained data. Although intriguing, these findings aren’t yet definitive. Scientists need more independent data to rule out measurement errors. If multiple methods reveal the same patterns, it could signal a major shift in how we understand the cosmos.\n#### Testing the Universe with Euclid\nA new study published in the _Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics_ by James Adam and colleagues introduces a novel method for testing whether the Universe is truly isotropic—that is, the same in all directions. Their approach uses data from cutting-edge instruments like [Euclid](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/euclid-mission/), a European Space Agency ([ESA](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/european-space-agency/)) space telescope launched in 2023. Euclid has recently started capturing remarkably detailed images of the cosmos, offering an unprecedented combination of power, precision, and resolution.\n“We investigated a different method of constraining anisotropy, which involved so-called weak [gravitational lensing](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-gravitational-lensing/),” says Adam. Weak lensing occurs because matter between us and a distant galaxy slightly bends the galaxy’s light, altering its apparent shape. This specific type of distortion can reveal whether anisotropies exist in the Universe. In fact, the analysis of weak lensing data allows scientists to separate the signal into two components: E-mode shear, which is generated by the distribution of matter in an isotropic and homogeneous Universe, and B-mode shear, which is typically very weak and should not appear on large scales in an isotropic Universe.\nSimply observing B-modes on large scales would not be enough to confirm anisotropies, as these signals are very weak and could result from measurement errors or secondary effects. If an anisotropy is real, it would affect both E-modes and B-modes in a non-independent way, generating a correlation between the two signals. Only if Euclid’s data reveal a significant correlation between E- and B-modes would it suggest an anisotropic expansion of the Universe.\n**Next Steps and Possible Implications**\nIn their study, Adam and colleagues simulated the effects of an anisotropic universe expansion on a computer and developed a model describing how deviations from isotropy would modify the weak lensing signal. They then calculated the E-B cross-correlation to demonstrate that an anisotropic universe would produce a correlation between the two signals, and applied their model to future Euclid data, showing that these observations will be precise enough to detect potential anisotropies.\nEuclid is already beginning to provide useful data for these analyses, and new observatories will soon come online. Now that they have developed the proper methodology, Adam and his colleagues intend to apply it to real data. “Once you’ve kind of quadruple-checked your work, then you have to seriously consider whether this fundamental assumption is actually true or not, particularly in the late Universe. Or perhaps it just was never true,” explains Adam.\n#### Rethinking Cosmic Origins\nIf these anomalies are confirmed, they would open a new chapter in cosmology. It won’t be easy, though: there are already alternative theoretical models that predict anisotropies, but none are as solid or widely accepted as the Standard Model. However, any theoretical revision would also depend on the extent of the anisotropy that could be detected, which remains uncertain.“It could be a serious revision,” concludes Adam, “or just adding a little term here or there. Who knows?”\n#### If you want to learn more…\n_The Cosmological Principle_\nWe know that the Universe is expanding, and this might lead us to mistakenly imagine that there is a center (where the Big Bang occurred) from which this expansion originated. Instead, we should think of our Universe as if it were the surface of the Earth: we can move in any direction without ever reaching an edge, but there is no center on the surface. If Earth behaved like a balloon being inflated, we would see that the space on its surface expands, but there would be no specific point on it that could be considered the center of the expansion.\nAccording to the Cosmological Principle, not only is there no center or privileged location in cosmic space, but space itself has homogeneous properties everywhere, at least on sufficiently large scales. We know that there are voids and dense regions, such as galaxies and the space between them, but if we zoom out, just like we zoom out on a smartphone with two fingers, these inhomogeneities disappear. This principle forms the foundation of the theoretical model we use today to explain the origin, evolution, and current state of the Universe. It is also very convenient because it implies that the laws of physics apply everywhere in the same way, significantly simplifying our understanding of the cosmos.\n_Weak Lensing_\nWeak lensing is based on the principle, described by general relativity, that gravity can bend the path of light. The greater the mass of a celestial body, the stronger the distortion of light passing near it. Galaxies and other objects located behind a massive gravitational field appear subtly distorted, with their shapes and orientations slightly altered.\nThis effect is similar to looking at an object through a magnifying glass. Just as the curved surface of the lens bends and distorts light, changing the apparent shape and position of objects behind it, the gravitational field of a massive cosmic structure bends and distorts the light from distant galaxies. As a result, an elliptical galaxy may appear slightly squished or rotated.\nBy carefully analyzing these distortions across billions of galaxies, surveys like Euclid and LSST can detect weak lensing, revealing the presence and distribution of unseen matter, including dark matter.\nReference: “Probing the Cosmological Principle with weak lensing shear” by James Adam, Roy Maartens, Julien Larena and Chris Clarkson, 11 February 2025,  _Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics_.

Captured by the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at the European Southern Observatory’s Paranal site, the image reveals a vibrant collection of galaxies scattered across the sky, from faint blue smudges to the bright, fried-egg appearance of NGC 3640. What makes this galaxy especially intriguing is what looks like a “double yolk,” due to a smaller neighboring galaxy that may be uncomfortably close.\n#### Galactic Transformations Over Time\nOver billions of years, [galaxies](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-galaxy/) undergo dramatic transformations. As they drift through space, they can steal gas and stars from others, or even collide and merge entirely. These interactions often leave behind distortions — visible signs of past encounters. In NGC 3640, this is seen in its warped shape and the faint, diffuse light surrounding it. These features act as “scars” from previous galactic mergers, offering astronomers important clues about the galaxy’s turbulent history.\n_This video is a crash course on galaxy clashes (pun intended!), explaining that the collision between two galaxies is not as violent a process as one could imagine. Credit: ESO, A. Milani, J. C. Muñoz, Tubín et al._\n#### Fossil Clues From Star Clusters\nTo piece together the backstory of NGC 3640 and its nearby companion, astronomers from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics studied their [globular clusters](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-globular-cluster/) — tightly packed groups of stars held together by gravity. These clusters often contain some of the oldest stars in a galaxy, making them excellent “fossil markers.” By analyzing them, researchers can reconstruct a galaxy’s history, including details of past mergers and interactions long after they’ve occurred.\n#### A Close Encounter — But Is It Dangerous?\n[The results](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/11/aa51273-24/aa51273-24.html) confirm that NGC 3640 has engulfed other galaxies before, an ominous sign for the smaller galaxy now in its path, NGC 3641. Yet, this small galactic underdog shows a distinct lack of distortions in its shape or the globular clusters within. This suggests that their interaction, while fast, is not happening close enough for NGC 3640 to pose a threat. NGC 3641 might be safe… for now.\nReferences:\n“VEGAS-SSS: Tracing globular cluster populations in the interacting NGC 3640 galaxy group” by Marco Mirabile, Michele Cantiello, Pratik Lonare, Rossella Ragusa, Maurizio Paolillo, Nandini Hazra, Antonio La Marca, Enrichetta Iodice, Marilena Spavone, Steffen Mieske, Marina Rejkuba, Michael Hilker, Gabriele Riccio, Rebecca A.

With next-gen observations, we might finally glimpse what lies beyond._\n#### Einstein, Schwarzschild, and the Birth of Black Holes\n“Hic sunt leones,” remarks Stefano Liberati, director of the Institute for Fundamental Physics of the Universe (IFPU) and one of authors of a new paper published in the _Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics_. The Latin phrase, meaning “here be lions,” was once used on ancient maps to mark unknown or dangerous territories. In this case, it refers to the singularity predicted to exist at the center of traditional black holes, those described by [Einstein’s general relativity](https://scitechdaily.com/science-made-simple-what-is-the-theory-of-relativity/).\nTo understand why this matters, it helps to revisit the origin of the idea. In 1915, Albert Einstein introduced his groundbreaking theory of general relativity. Just a year later, German physicist Karl Schwarzschild discovered an exact solution to Einstein’s equations, revealing the possibility of objects so dense that nothing, not even light, could escape their gravitational grip. These are the [black holes](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-black-hole/) we know today.\nBut from the outset, the concept raised troubling questions. In the 1960s, scientists realized that, according to the math, spacetime becomes infinitely curved at a black hole’s center. This “singularity” implies a point where gravity becomes infinitely strong and the known laws of physics break down. If such a singularity truly exists, it would mean that general relativity, one of the most successful theories in physics, fails under extreme conditions. For many physicists, referring to a “singularity” is less an explanation and more an admission: we simply don’t yet understand what’s really happening at the core of a black hole.\n#### The Singularity Problem in Physics\nDespite these theoretical challenges, evidence for black holes has grown steadily since the 1970s. Major breakthroughs—like the first detection of [gravitational waves](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-gravitational-waves/) in 2015, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s images of black holes in [2019](https://scitechdaily.com/chandra-black-hole-close-up-image-makes-history/) and [2022](https://scitechdaily.com/stunning-reveal-first-image-of-the-black-hole-at-the-center-of-our-milky-way-galaxy/)—have brought us closer than ever to observing black holes directly. These discoveries were even recognized with Nobel Prizes in 2017 and 2020. Yet, none of these observations have been able to confirm or rule out the existence of singularities. What lies at a black hole’s core remains one of the biggest open questions in physics.\n#### Beyond the Event Horizon: Searching for Answers\nAnd this brings us back to the “leones” Liberati refers to: we can describe black hole physics only up to a certain distance from the center. Beyond that lies mystery — an unacceptable situation for science. This is why researchers have long been seeking a new paradigm, one in which the singularity is “healed” by quantum effects that gravity must exhibit under such extreme conditions. This naturally leads to models of black holes without singularities, like those explored in the work of Liberati and his collaborators.\nOne of the interesting aspects of the new paper is its collaborative origin. It is neither the work of a single research group nor a traditional review article. “It’s something more,” explains Liberati. “It emerged from a set of discussions among leading experts in the field — theorists and phenomenologists, junior and senior researchers — all brought together during a dedicated IFPU workshop. The paper is a synthesis of the ideas presented and debated in the sessions, which roughly correspond to the structure of the article itself.” According to Liberati, the added value lies in the conversation itself: “On several topics, participants had initially divergent views — and some ended the sessions with at least partially changed opinions.”\n#### Rethinking Black Holes: Three Competing Models\nDuring that meeting, three main black hole models were outlined: the standard black hole predicted by classical general relativity, with both a singularity and an event horizon; the regular black hole, which eliminates the singularity but retains the horizon; and the black hole mimicker, which reproduces the external features of a black hole but has neither a singularity nor an event horizon.\nThe paper also describes how regular black holes and mimickers might form, how they could possibly transform into one another, and, most importantly, what kind of observational tests might one day distinguish them from standard black holes.\nWhile the observations collected so far have been groundbreaking, they don’t tell us everything. Since 2015, we’ve detected gravitational waves from black hole mergers and obtained images of the shadows of two black holes: M87* and Sagittarius A*. But these observations focus only on the outside — they provide no insight into whether a singularity lies at the center.\n“But all is not lost,” says Liberati. “Regular black holes, and especially mimickers, are never exactly identical to standard black holes — not even outside the horizon. So observations that probe these regions could, indirectly, tell us something about their internal structure.”\n#### The Role of Advanced Instruments and Experiments\nTo do so, we will need to measure subtle deviations from the predictions of Einstein’s theory, using increasingly sophisticated instruments and different observational channels. For example, in the case of mimickers, high-resolution imaging by the Event Horizon Telescope could reveal unexpected details in the light bent around these objects — such as more complex photon rings. Gravitational waves might show subtle anomalies compatible with non-classical spacetime geometries. And thermal radiation from the surface of a horizonless object — like a mimicker — could offer another promising clue.\n#### Toward a Quantum Theory of Gravity\nCurrent knowledge is not yet sufficient to determine exactly what kind of perturbations we should be looking for, or how strong they might be. However, significant advances in theoretical understanding and numerical simulations are expected in the coming years. These will lay the groundwork for new observational tools, designed specifically with alternative models in mind. Just as happened with gravitational waves, theory will guide observation — and then observation will refine theory, perhaps even ruling out certain hypotheses.\nThis line of research holds enormous promise: it could help lead to the development of a quantum theory of gravity, a bridge between general relativity — which describes the universe on large scales — and quantum mechanics, which governs the subatomic world.\n“What lies ahead for gravity research,” concludes Liberati, “is a truly exciting time. We are entering an era where a vast and unexplored landscape is opening up before us.”\nReference: “Towards a non-singular paradigm of black hole physics” by Raúl Carballo-Rubio, Francesco Di Filippo, Stefano Liberati, Matt Visser, Julio Arrechea, Carlos Barceló, Alfio Bonanno, Johanna Borissova, Valentin Boyanov, Vitor Cardoso, Francesco Del Porro, Astrid Eichhorn, Daniel Jampolski, Prado Martín-Moruno, Jacopo Mazza, Tyler McMaken, Antonio Panassiti, Paolo Pani, Alessia Platania, Luciano Rezzolla and Vania Vellucci, 6 May 2025, _Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics_.

This ambitious project has resulted in the most complete bird evolutionary tree to date.\nTo build this comprehensive phylogenetic tree, the researchers integrated data on 9,239 bird species from nearly 300 scientific studies published between 1990 and 2024. They supplemented this with curated information on an additional 1,000 species. The resulting dataset is designed for easy sharing and continuous updates as new research becomes available.\n“People love birds, and a lot of people work on birds. People publish scientific papers about birds’ evolutionary relationships all the time,” McTavish said. “We synthesized all the data to have unified information all in one place.”\nThe methodology and findings are detailed in a paper published in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_. According to the authors, this synthesized evolutionary tree has broad potential applications for studying bird evolution and ecology. Moreover, the approach used to build the tree can be adapted to study other groups of animals and plants.\nThe project started about four years ago when Eliot Miller, then with the Cornell lab, reached out to McTavish, who has been working on software for the [Open Tree of Life (OpenTree) project](https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2018/nsf-grant-helps-professor-connect-evolutionary-dots-along-open-tree-life) for about a decade.\n“Many dozens of bird phylogenies (studies of evolutionary histories using genetics) get published every year, yet their findings — with implications for everything from taxonomy to our understanding of ancestral characters — aren’t necessarily being used for downstream research,” Miller said. “Our project should help to close this research loop so that these studies and their findings are better incorporated into follow-up research.”\n#### Collaboration Through Shared Passion\nMcTavish said that though she hadn’t met Miller before he asked her to collaborate, this project dovetailed perfectly with her continuing work.\n“Eliot is really into birds, and the lab is full of bird experts, and they also develop birding apps such as Merlin and Ebird, so that was their side of it, and I’ve been working on this software to combine evolutionary trees, so that was my side of it,” she explained.\nOpenTree is a collaborative project that brings together evolutionary biologists and taxonomy experts to build an accurate, comprehensive evolutionary tree that describes how every named species on Earth is related to every other. It works on a wiki-like model, allowing users to manually upload data to update the tree’s evolutionary relationships.\nMcTavish explained that as new understandings of relationships emerge, users can add that information to the Tree of Life to ensure that it reflects the most current understanding of evolutionary relationships between species.\n#### Continual Updates in a Growing Tree of Life\nWith more than 2.5 million species now represented in the Open Tree of Life — and new data constantly streaming in thanks to advances in genome sequencing — McTavish, a biologist with the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences, and a collaborator have been writing software that automatically updates the tree as data emerges.\nShe said the bird species synthesis fills one more gap in the Open Tree.\nLike the new study, the Open Tree project is supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, which McTavish said has been crucial for establishing collaborations, gathering data from hundreds of published authors, and sharing information across disciplines and institutions.\n“This open science and collaborative environment really made this possible,” she said.\nReference: “A complete and dynamic tree of birds” by Emily Jane McTavish, Jeff A.

This discovery raises intriguing questions about whether chimpanzees intentionally consume alcohol and what effects it might have on their behavior.\n#### Alcohol and social bonding in humans and chimps\nIn humans, alcohol consumption is believed to date back deep into evolutionary history and is often associated with social bonding.\nAnd the new study suggests our closest relatives might be doing something similar.\n“For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,” said Anna Bowland, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.\n“We also know that sharing alcohol, including through traditions such as feasting, helps to form and strengthen social bonds.\n“So – now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits – the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?”\n#### Chimpanzees filmed sharing low-alcohol fruit\nThe researchers used motion-activated cameras, which filmed chimps sharing fermented fruits on 10 separate occasions.\nFruit shared by these chimps was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% ABV (Alcohol By Volume – a measure used in alcoholic drinks).\nThis is relatively low. But the researchers say it may be the “tip of the iceberg”, as 60-85% of chimps’ diet is fruit, so low levels of alcohol in various foods could add up to significant consumption.\n#### Evolutionary roots of alcohol metabolism\nThe researchers stress that chimps are unlikely to get “drunk” – as this would clearly not improve their survival chances.\nThe impact of alcohol on chimps’ metabolism is unknown. But recent discoveries of a molecular adaptation that greatly increased ethanol metabolism in the common ancestor of African apes suggest eating fermented fruits may have ancient origins in species, including humans and chimps.\n“Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behavior with fermented fruit might be important,” said Dr Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter.\n“We need to find out more about whether they deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolize it, but this behavior could be the early evolutionary stages of ‘feasting’. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.”\nReference: “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits” by Anna C.

This discovery could lead to transformative treatments for conditions such as depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.\nPublished in the journal _Psychedelics_ , the study reports that mice given a single dose of 25CN-NBOH, a selective serotonin 2A receptor agonist, performed significantly better on reversal learning tasks than control animals, even when tested two to three weeks after treatment.\n#### Key Findings\n“What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose,” said Professor Omar J. Ahmed, the study’s senior and corresponding author from the University of Michigan’s Department of Psychology. “We observed enhanced learning adaptability that persisted for weeks, suggesting these compounds may induce lasting and behaviorally meaningful neuroplasticity changes in the prefrontal cortex.”\nUsing an innovative automated sequential learning paradigm, researchers evaluated how well mice could adapt to rule reversals, a common method for testing cognitive flexibility. Mice treated with the psychedelic compound outperformed those given a saline solution, showing greater adaptability, improved task efficiency, a higher percentage of correct responses, and more rewards earned during the reversal phase.\n#### Implications for Brain Science\nThe results complement existing cellular research showing psychedelic-induced structural remodeling in the prefrontal cortex but uniquely demonstrate sustained cognitive benefits persisting long after the immediate effects of the drug have dissipated.\nAs interest in psychedelic medicine continues to grow, this research raises intriguing questions about how psychedelics might reshape neural pathways governing flexible thinking. Could these compounds potentially reopen critical periods of brain plasticity? What molecular mechanisms underlie these long-lasting cognitive improvements? How might the timing and frequency of administration affect long-term neuroplasticity?\n“The current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months. Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic,” according to Dr. Ahmed.\n#### Sex Differences and Clinical Potential\nImportantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes.\n“The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15-20 days after a single psychedelic administration,” notes Elizabeth J. Brouns, first author of the study. “This suggests that a single dose of a psychedelic isn’t just temporarily altering perception, but potentially inducing lasting beneficial changes in brain function.”\n#### Methodological Advances\nThe study’s automated behavioral task represents a significant methodological advance for evaluating flexible learning, enabling researchers to efficiently evaluate cognitive flexibility in future investigations of psychedelic compounds. This high-throughput approach could accelerate the development of targeted psychedelic therapies for specific cognitive deficits.\nReference: “Single-dose psychedelic enhances cognitive flexibility and reversal learning in mice weeks after administration” by Elizabeth J.

The study also explored which individuals are most likely to benefit from these so-called “good” bacteria.\nProbiotics are beneficial bacteria available in supplement form—such as tablets or drinks—and are also found in fermented foods like yogurt, cheese, and sauerkraut. While they’re well-known for supporting digestive health, there’s growing interest in their potential impact on mental health as well.\n“The gut–brain connection provides various routes through which bacteria in the gut can influence how we feel and behave, including via the vagus nerve, immune system, and hormones,” says Johnson.\n#### Daily Mood Reports Reveal Subtle Changes\nAlthough animal studies have shown promising effects of probiotics on brain function and behavior, human results have been mixed. To get a clearer picture, Johnson and Steenbergen combined multiple research methods to examine how probiotics might affect emotional regulation. These included psychological surveys, daily mood tracking, and computer-based tests that measure how people process emotional information. The study involved healthy young adults who took a daily probiotic containing strains such as _Lactobacillus_ and _Bifidobacterium_ for one month.\nThis is the first study to use daily mood reports to assess the effects of probiotics. It clearly shows that probiotics can reduce negative feelings compared to a placebo. This could mean a reduction in feelings such as anxiety, stress, fatigue, or depressive tendencies. “It is striking that by simply asking participants how they were feeling each day, we could detect the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood,” says Steenbergen. “In contrast, the standard psychological questionnaires that are common in this field were not sensitive enough to pick up these changes.”\n#### Not a Replacement for Antidepressants\nThe researchers found that it took about two weeks for the probiotics to improve negative feelings. It takes about the same amount of time for antidepressants to work, but whereas antidepressants tend to reduce both negative and positive mood, the results showed that the probiotics only reduced negative mood. This could be a possible benefit, although the researchers stress that probiotics should not be considered a substitute for antidepressants.\n#### Risk-Averse People May Benefit More from Probiotics\nWhen the researchers observed the decrease in negative feelings, they were keen to explore whether they could predict who would benefit most from probiotics. “We found that various traits, most notably a propensity for risk avoidance, were associated with a greater effect of probiotics on mood,” says Johnson.\nIn addition, the researchers found evidence that probiotics may affect the way participants process emotional cues. The participants who received probiotics were slightly more accurate at recognising facial expressions.\n#### A Hopeful Future for Mood-Boosting Microbes\nMany questions remain unanswered about how exactly probiotics work and their long-term effects. “Perhaps in the future probiotics could be used in a targeted way as an early intervention to reduce the chances of negative feelings progressing to mental health conditions such as depression, though more research would be needed to confirm that,” says Steenbergen.\nJohnson and Steenbergen hope their findings will also spur other mental health researchers to include simple daily measures of mood in their studies.

Below it, a dense truss-like frame supports the 39-meter (128-foot) primary mirror — the largest telescope mirror ever built.\nLight collected by this enormous mirror will reflect upward to a secondary mirror, positioned in the central ring at the top of the structure. From there, the light will travel downward again through the central tower, passing through three additional mirrors before reaching the telescope’s scientific instruments, which will be located off to the side.\n_The central tower that will hold some of the world’s most sophisticated mirrors is now installed on ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The tower is 3 stories tall and has to be as rigid and lightweight as possible – a true feat of engineering. The tower will hold 3 of the ELT’s 5 mirrors; they will correct the blur caused by atmospheric turbulence and relay the light to the scientific instruments by the side of the telescope. Credit: ESO_\nWithout a person or familiar object for scale, the size of the structure can be deceptive. In reality, the altitude structure alone stands more than 50 meters (164 feet) tall, and the dome’s roof opening spans 41 meters (135 feet). Climbing from the base of the dome to the top via internal stairs and walkways takes around 30 minutes — a true feat of endurance, and a testament to the telescope’s monumental scale.\n**Never miss a breakthrough:[Join the SciTechDaily newsletter.](https://scitechdaily.com/newsletter/)**\n[Astronomy](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/astronomy/) [ELT](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/elt/) [European Southern Observatory](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/european-southern-observatory/)\nShare.

This new source challenges long-held assumptions that only neutron star collisions created such materials, and hints at other, undiscovered stellar factories lurking in the cosmos._\n#### A Rare Cosmic Factory for Gold and Platinum\nAstronomers have identified a previously unknown birthplace of some of the universe’s rarest elements: a giant flare from an ultra-magnetized star known as a magnetar. Their calculations suggest that these powerful stellar eruptions could account for up to 10 percent of the galaxy’s supply of heavy elements, including gold and platinum.\nThe finding also solves a 20-year-old mystery linked to a bright flash of light and [particles detected by a space telescope](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03525) in December 2004. The source of the burst was a magnetar—a neutron star with magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth’s—that had released a brief but intense flare. Though the flare lasted only a few seconds, it unleashed more energy than the Sun produces in a million years. While the main flare was quickly understood, a second, weaker signal detected about 10 minutes later remained unexplained—until now.\n#### A Historic Clue Reveals a Heavy Element Birth\nResearchers at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City recently determined that this second signal was evidence of heavy element formation, including gold and platinum. According to their analysis, the 2004 flare may have produced a mass of heavy elements equal to roughly one-third the mass of Earth.\nThe discovery, published April 29 in _The Astrophysical Journal Letters_, marks just the second time scientists have directly observed the formation of such elements. The first confirmed source was the collision of two neutron stars, observed in 2017.\n“This is really just the second time we’ve ever directly seen proof of where these elements form,” the first being neutron star mergers, says study co-author Brian Metzger, a senior research scientist at the CCA and a professor at Columbia University. “It’s a substantial leap in our understanding of heavy elements production.”\n#### The Origins of the Elements Around Us\nMost of the elements we know and love today weren’t always around. Hydrogen, helium, and a dash of lithium were formed in the Big Bang, but almost everything else has been manufactured by stars in their lives, or during their violent deaths. While scientists thoroughly understand where and how the lighter elements are made, the production locations of many of the heaviest neutron-rich elements — those heavier than iron — remain incomplete.\nThese elements, which include uranium and strontium, are produced in a set of nuclear reactions known as the rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process. This process requires an excess of free neutrons — something that can be found only in extreme environments. Astronomers thus expected that the extreme environments created by supernovae or neutron star mergers were the most promising potential r-process sites.\n#### Neutron Star Collisions Weren’t Enough\nIt wasn’t until 2017 that astronomers were able to confirm an r-process site when they observed the collision of two neutron stars. These stars are the collapsed remnants of former stellar giants and made of a soup of neutrons so dense that a single tablespoon would weigh more than 1 billion tons. The 2017 observations showed that the cataclysmic collision of two of these stars creates the neutron-rich environment needed for the formation of r-process elements.\nHowever, astronomers realized that these rare collisions alone can’t account for all the r-process-produced elements we see today. Some suspected that magnetars, which are highly magnetized neutron stars, could also be a source.\n#### How Magnetar Flares Create Precious Metals\nMetzger and colleagues [calculated in 2024](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/3/5323/7598235) that giant flares could eject material from a magnetar’s crust into space, where r-process elements could form.\n“It’s pretty incredible to think that some of the heavy elements all around us, like the precious metals in our phones and computers, are produced in these crazy extreme environments,” says Anirudh Patel, a doctoral candidate at Columbia University and lead author on the new study.\n> “It’s pretty incredible to think that some of the heavy elements all around us, like the precious metals in our phones and computers, are produced in these crazy extreme environments.”\n> Anirudh Patel\nThe group’s calculations show that these giant flares create unstable, heavy radioactive nuclei, which decay into stable elements such as gold. As the radioactive elements decay, they emit a glow of light, in addition to minting new elements.\n#### A Forgotten Signal, Reinterpreted\nThe group also calculated in 2024 that the glow from the radioactive decays would be visible as a burst of gamma rays, a form of highly energized light. When they discussed their findings with observational gamma-ray astronomers, the group learned that, in fact, one such signal had been seen decades earlier that had never been explained. Since there’s little overlap between the study of magnetar activity and heavy-element synthesis science, no one had previously proposed element production as a cause of the signal.\n“The event had kind of been forgotten over the years,” Metzger says. “But we very quickly realized that our model was a perfect fit for it.”\n#### Massive Element Output from One Flare\nIn the new paper, the astronomers used the observations of the 2004 event to estimate that the flare produced 2 million billion billion kilograms of heavy elements (roughly equivalent to Mars’ mass). From this, they estimate that one to 10 percent of all r-process elements in our galaxy today were created in these giant flares. The remainder could be from neutron star mergers, but with only one magnetar giant flare and one merger ever documented, it’s hard to know exact percentages — or if that’s even the whole story.\n“We can’t exclude that there could be third or fourth sites out there that we just haven’t seen yet,” Metzger says.\n#### Early Galaxies, Missing Pieces\n“The interesting thing about these giant flares is that they can occur really early in galactic history,” Patel adds. “Magnetar giant flares could be the solution to a problem we’ve had where there are more heavy elements seen in young galaxies than could be created from neutron star collisions alone.”\nTo narrow down the percentages, more magnetar giant flares need to be observed. Telescopes like NASA’s Compton Spectrometer and Imager mission, set to launch in 2027, will help better capture these signals. Large magnetar flares seem to occur every few decades in the Milky Way and about once a year across the visible universe — but the trick is to catch it in time.\n“Once a gamma-ray burst is detected, you have to point an ultraviolet telescope at the source within 10 to 15 minutes to see the signal’s peak and confirm r-process elements are made there,” Metzger says. “It’ll be a fun chase.”\nExplore Further: [The Magnetar That Forged a Planet’s Worth of Gold in Half a Second](https://scitechdaily.com/?p=473017&preview=true)\nReference: “Direct Evidence for r-process Nucleosynthesis in Delayed MeV Emission from the SGR 1806–20 Magnetar Giant Flare” by Anirudh Patel, Brian D.

Data from its first year of observations hinted that dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the cosmos, might not be constant as previously believed.\nAlthough researchers are still working to confirm these results, the evidence points to the possibility that dark energy changes over time. If verified, this would mark a major shift in our understanding of cosmology. The DESI collaboration recently presented updated findings at the American Physical Society’s Global Physics Summit.\n“If the DESI result holds up, it means that a cosmological constant is not the origin of cosmic acceleration. It’s much more exciting,” said Andrew Hearin, a physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, which is a DESI member institution. ​“It would mean that space is pervaded by a dynamically evolving fluid with negative gravity, which has never been observed in any tabletop experiment on Earth.”\nTo help investigate the observations, Hearin and colleagues turned to the [Aurora exascale supercomputer](https://www.anl.gov/article/argonne-releases-aurora-exascale-supercomputer-to-researchers-enabling-accelerated-science) at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science user facility. By running large-scale simulations of the universe, they are providing a testing ground for researchers to analyze the DESI data.\n“When this result came out last year, we got really, really excited,” said Katrin Heitmann, a cosmologist and deputy director of Argonne’s High Energy Physics division. ​“Our team got together to discuss what we could do to help the community look into this from the simulation side. Simulations play a crucial role in disentangling fundamental physics from systematics in the observations or in the data analysis.”\n#### DESI: Shedding light on dark energy\n[DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), located at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, is an international collaboration of over 900 scientists led by DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mounted on the Mayall Telescope, DESI was designed for spectroscopic surveys.\nInstead of capturing images, it collects light spectra from distant galaxies to determine their structure, distance, and movement. In its first year of operation, DESI has enabled researchers to create the most detailed 3D map of the universe ever made and track its expansion over the past 11 billion years.\nDESI’s initial data largely align with the standard model of cosmology (our current understanding of the universe), but small discrepancies suggest dark energy might be changing over time. This would challenge the current theory for cosmic acceleration: the cosmological constant.\nFirst introduced by Albert Einstein in his equations for general relativity in 1917, the cosmological constant was meant to counteract gravitational collapse and support the idea of a static universe. However, the discovery about a decade later that the universe is expanding led scientists to abandon the idea.\nThe concept was revived in the 1990s when observations showed that the universe was not only expanding but doing so at an increasingly faster rate. While the simplest explanation was to bring back the cosmological constant, the nature of dark energy remains one of the greatest mysteries in physics.\n“The cosmological constant is essentially just an extra term in the equation that everyone has been using for years,” Hearin said. ​“We don’t know why it takes on the particular value that it does, but it’s a very mundane explanation for this unexpected cosmic acceleration.”\n#### Simulations provide test bed for cosmic exploration\nA key challenge in cosmology is determining whether observed patterns in the universe are real or distortions caused by how we collect and analyze data. Simulations help researchers address this issue, offering a controlled environment to test different scenarios.\n“Since we can’t create a mini universe to conduct experiments, we can test theories by using really big computers like Aurora to simulate the growth of structure in the universe over time,” said Gillian Beltz-Mohrmann, a postdoctoral research fellow at Argonne.\nTo examine the DESI results, the Argonne team used Aurora to run two large-scale simulations — one assuming a constant dark energy and another where it changes over time. Both started with identical initial conditions, enabling researchers to track even the smallest differences as they evolved.\n“The idea is that you create a model universe under one set of assumptions, and then you compare your model universe to the real universe. If the agreement is very good, it gives you some confidence that your assumptions are correct,” Hearin said. ​“But if you have some gross discrepancy, then it tells you that your assumptions don’t align with the real universe and don’t represent the truth.”\nWhile simulations can’t directly confirm DESI’s findings, they provide a critical feedback loop between theory and observation. By testing different measurements within the simulations, researchers can refine their analysis techniques and assess whether the observed patterns could emerge from systematic effects rather than new physics.\n“If looking at these two simulations gives us an idea of the type of measurement we should make to help us narrow in on a cosmological model, then we can go back to the real DESI data and make that same measurement and see what it tells us,” Beltz-Mohrmann said.\n#### Bringing the universe into focus with Aurora\nThe scale and complexity of running massive cosmological simulations at high resolution over vast volumes can lead to long runtimes, but Aurora allowed the team to complete them quickly.\n“Using Aurora’s immense processing power to rapidly run large-scale simulations at sufficiently high resolution, we can respond much faster to new insights from cosmological observations,” said Argonne computational scientist Adrian Pope. ​“These simulations would have taken weeks of compute time on our earlier supercomputers, but each simulation took just two days on Aurora.”\nAchieving high resolution was particularly critical for this study, as Heitmann explained: ​“Aurora is extremely important because to detect these fine differences, we need incredibly high resolution in our simulations. Without that level of resolution, details can get washed out. Think of it like taking off your glasses and trying to make out a blurry figure.”\nTo further accelerate their work, the team employed a method called on-the-fly analysis, which allowed them to process simulation data as it was being generated. This approach eliminated bottlenecks in storing and post-processing simulation data, leveraging Aurora’s power to extract insights faster and refine simulations in real time.\n“This pair of simulations really illustrates our ability to take a result that’s hot off the presses from a collaboration like DESI, immediately run a simulation based on those results, and then see what it looks like,” Beltz-Mohrmann said.\nWhile DESI’s findings continue to be scrutinized, the team’s simulations provide a valuable tool for improving analysis methods and exploring new ways to interpret the data. To enable additional studies, the team has made the [simulation data publicly available](https://cosmology.alcf.anl.gov/).\n“This is a new caliber of simulations in the field,” Hearin said. ​“Essentially, it provides the community with a test bed to try out ideas for distinguishing between these two universes. The simulations can offer insight into how we might use DESI data to determine which of these competing models of dark energy is the truth.”\nReference: “Illuminating the Physics of Dark Energy with the Discovery Simulations” by Gillian D.

A study conducted by scientists from the University of Vienna and EPFL Lausanne has found that climbing shoes release potentially harmful chemicals into the air through the abrasion of their rubber soles.\nThese substances, which include compounds also found in car tires, can become airborne in indoor bouldering gyms and be inhaled by climbers. In some cases, the concentration of these chemicals was even higher than levels typically measured on busy city streets. The findings were published in _Environmental Science & Technology Air_.\nBouldering gyms are often characterized by a distinct set of smells: sweat, chalk, and the faint scent of rubber. Researchers led by environmental scientist Thilo Hofmann at the University of Vienna have now confirmed that the rubber particles contributing to this smell are more than just a sensory nuisance, they pose a health concern.\nThe team discovered that the rubber used in climbing shoes contains various chemical additives, some of which are suspected to have negative effects on human health and the environment. As the soles wear down during use, these substances are released into the air, where they can be inhaled by athletes during intense physical activity.\n“The soles of climbing shoes are high performance products, just like car tires,” explains Anya Sherman, first author of the study and an environmental scientist at the Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science (CeMESS) at the University of Vienna. Additives are specific chemicals that make these materials more resilient and durable; they are essential for their function.\n#### Climbing Meets Chemistry\nSherman enjoys climbing herself – as a balance to her work in the lab and on the computer. At a conference, she met Thibault Masset from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), who researches similar topics and also enjoys climbing. The two researchers and equal first authors of the study came up with the idea of testing the rubber from their own climbing shoes using the same scientific methods they use to analyze car tires.\n“We were familiar with the black residue on the holds in climbing gyms, the abrasion from the soles of our shoes. Climbers wipe it off to get a better grip, and it gets kicked up into the air,” adds Sherman.\nEquipped with an impinger, a particle-measuring device that mimics the human respiratory tract, Sherman, in collaboration with Professor Lea Ann Daily’s research group, collected air samples in five bouldering gyms in Vienna. The impinger draws in air at a rate of 60 liters per minute and separates particles in the same way as they would enter the human lungs. Other dust samples for the study were collected in collaboration with the EPFL Lausanne from bouldering gyms in France, Spain, and Switzerland.\n“Air pollution in the bouldering gyms was higher than we expected,” says corresponding author Thilo Hofmann. What was striking was that the concentration of rubber additives was particularly high where many people were climbing in a confined space. Hofmann concludes: “The levels we measured are among the highest ever documented worldwide, comparable to multi-lane roads in megacities.”\n#### Tire Chemicals on Your Feet\nIn 30 pairs of shoes tested, the team found some of the same pollutants as in car tires: among the 15 rubber additives found was 6PPD, a rubber stabilizer whose transformation product has been linked to salmon kills in rivers.\nWhat this means for human health is still unclear. But Hofmann stresses: “These substances do not belong in the air we breathe. It makes sense to act before we know all the details about the risks, especially with regard to sensitive groups such as children.”\nSherman also points out that the operators of the studied bouldering gyms were very cooperative and showed a high level of interest in improving the air quality in their gyms. “This constructive cooperation should lead to the creation of the healthiest possible climbing hall environment, for example, through better ventilation, cleaning, avoiding peak times, and designing climbing shoes with fewer additives.”\n“It is essential to switch to sole materials with fewer harmful substances,” says Hofmann. He says manufacturers are currently not sufficiently aware of the problem. The rubber they buy for their soles contains a cocktail of undesirable chemicals. More research is needed to understand how these substances affect the human body. Anya Sherman remains motivated: “I will continue to climb, and I am confident that our research will contribute to better conditions in climbing gyms.”\nReference: “The Invisible Footprint of Climbing Shoes: High Exposure to Rubber Additives in Indoor Facilities” by Anya Sherman, Thibault Masset, Lukas Wimmer, Leah K.

Their findings, published in two papers in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The _Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association_ , present results from the EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems).\nThis multi-site clinical trial focused on sedentary older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a key risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia. The researchers also compared the outcomes of the exercise groups to data from similar individuals who received only standard care, such as routine doctor visits and medication management.\nThe researchers found:\n  * Cognitive function remained stable over 12 months for participants in both the low and moderate-to-high intensity exercise groups.\n  * Both exercise groups experienced significantly less cognitive decline over 12 months compared to individuals who did not participate in the exercise program.\n  * Participants in the exercise groups also tended to show less loss of brain volume over the same period, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n#### Understanding mild cognitive impairment\nIndividuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition characterized by memory complaints and objective memory decline, are at high risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia, with approximately 16% of people with this condition progressing to Alzheimer’s each year.\n“This is a critical time to intervene in this population, because they don’t have dementia yet, but are at a very high risk,” said Aladdin Shadyab, Ph.D., M.P.H., lead author of one of the new papers and associate professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and School of Medicine. “Together, these findings show us that even low-intensity exercise may slow cognitive decline in at-risk older adults.”\nWhile previous studies have suggested that exercise may be beneficial for cognitive health, the evidence has been mixed, and large, well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the potential benefits of exercise for older adults with mild cognitive impairment. The EXERT study, coordinated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at UC San Diego, in partnership with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, fills this gap.\n“EXERT was one of the first large clinical trials of exercise that partnered with the YMCA and its trainers to bring the intervention closer to home for research participants,” said Howard Feldman, M.D., ADCS director. “This approach brings us one step closer to its implementation in the community.”\n#### Advancing alzheimer’s research infrastructure\nThe ADCS was formed in 1991 under a cooperative agreement between the National Institute on Aging and UC San Diego and is one of the key initiatives for Alzheimer’s research supported by the federal government, addressing treatments for both cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s.\n“There’s an urgent need to identify effective and feasible ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s dementia, and UC San Diego has been a leader in this field for many years,” added Feldman, who is also a professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nEXERT included nearly 300 sedentary older adults with mild cognitive impairment who were randomly assigned to either moderate-high intensity aerobic training or lower-intensity stretching, balance, and range of motion activities. Participants completed their assigned exercise 3-4 times per week for 12 months under the supervision of a YMCA trainer, and the study also included regular assessments of cognitive function and brain volume.\n#### Surprising outcomes and new insights\n“EXERT is a landmark study because it’s the largest rigorous trial of exercise ever conducted in adults with mild cognitive impairment,” said Laura Baker, Ph.D., principal investigator of the EXERT study and professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. “Exercise has well-documented benefits to nearly every aspect of human health, but we’re still unlocking the full potential of exercise as medicine for older adults with memory problems.\nThough the researchers expected to see further cognitive decline in EXERT participants, they actually found that cognitive function remained stable for both exercise groups over the course of the study. This suggests that both lower and higher intensity exercise could slow cognitive decline. Another possible explanation for the results is that participating in research itself, regardless of the treatment, may offer protection against cognitive decline due to the intellectual and social stimulation involved.\nOverall, the findings of both studies taken together suggest that exercise may be a promising, safe, and feasible strategy to promote brain health and prevent continued cognitive decline for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\n“While there’s still a lot to learn, these findings show that regular intensity exercise, even at low intensity, could go a long way toward helping older adults slow or delay cognitive decline, and this is promising news for those who are at high risk for dementia,” added Shadyab.\nReferences: “Effects of exercise on cognition and Alzheimer’s biomarkers in a randomized controlled trial of adults with mild cognitive impairment: The EXERT study” by Laura D.

The findings showed that these factors significantly accelerate brain aging, and the researchers proposed strategies to support brain health. Their study was published in Research.\n#### Background\nAs people age, their brains experience a range of structural changes linked to aging, including cerebral atrophy, white matter microstructure damage, and increased white matter hyperintensities. These changes are strongly associated with the onset and progression of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Brain age, which is estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, has become a key biomarker for assessing brain aging.\nMost existing brain age prediction models use a single neuroimaging method. However, multi-modal brain imaging offers a more detailed view of how individuals’ brains age and improves prediction accuracy. There is growing evidence that health-related risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar, and smoking may influence brain structure. Still, the exact relationship between these risk factors and brain aging is not well understood. Identifying the specific factors that speed up brain aging is therefore critical for supporting long-term brain health.\n#### Research progress\nThis study, utilizing a 16-year clinical follow-up cohort of the Kailuan population, elucidated that long-term adverse lifestyle, metabolic abnormalities, and other risk factors significantly accelerate brain aging.\nFirst, the authors constructed a matrix dataset integrating multi-dimensional health risk factors and multi-modal brain imaging features. By applying correlation analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons, they investigated the associations between multi-dimensional risk factors and multi-modal brain imaging features. They further identified the five risk factors most strongly associated with brain imaging features:\n  1. Hypertension\n  2. Hyperglycemia\n  3. Hypercreatinemia\n  4. Smoking\n  5. Relatively low educational level\n\n\nThis finding preliminarily provides key insights into the risk factors that accelerate brain aging.\nSubsequently, the participants were stratified into five groups based on the number of high-risk factors they exhibited: 0 (healthy control), 1, 2, 3, and 4-5 high-risk factor groups. The brain age prediction model was trained on the healthy group and subsequently applied to the five risk exposure groups to predict their brain ages and compare the differences in brain aging. The results indicate that individuals with 4-5 high-risk factors exhibit a significantly greater brain age gap (BAG) compared to the healthy group and other risk exposure groups. This suggests that a range of health factors across unhealthy lifestyles, metabolic abnormalities, and other risk factors may collectively contribute to the accelerated aging process of the brain.\nA further in-depth analysis revealed that the BAG predicted by T1-weighted imaging was significantly higher in the hypertensive subjects compared to those normotensive subjects. This indicates that hypertension exerts a pivotal influence on the structural degeneration of brain tissue and is a key factor in accelerating brain aging.\n#### Suggestions for Future Research\nThis study, based on a long-term longitudinal follow-up of a large population, reveals that the five risk factors—hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercreatinemia, smoking, and low educational attainment—accelerate brain aging, with hypertension causing the most significant brain damage.\nFuture research will incorporate longitudinal brain imaging data to assess the dynamic progression pattern of brain aging. In addition, future research is warranted to fully excavate high-dimensional information from multi-modal images, thereby enhancing the predictive and generalization capabilities of the models.\nIn summary, this study elucidates that a range of health risk factors contribute to the acceleration of brain aging, and effective management of blood pressure, blood glucose, and creatinine levels, along with reduced smoking and improved educational attainment, are essential for promoting brain health.\nReference: “Discovery of High-Risk Clinical Factors That Accelerate Brain Aging in Adults: A Population-Based Machine Learning Study” by Jing Sun, Luyao Wang, Yiwen Gao, Ying Hui, Shuohua Chen, Shouling Wu, Zhenchang Wang, Jiehui Jiang and Han Lv, 21 October 2024, _Research_.

Often referred to as “handedness,” chirality describes objects that come in distinct left- or right-handed forms. It’s a fundamental feature of nature, appearing across many scales: in molecules and amino acids, in the iconic double-helix structure of DNA, and even in the spiral shapes of snail shells.\nNow, researchers at Princeton University have discovered a hidden chiral quantum state in a material once believed to be non-chiral. This breakthrough sheds light on a long-standing debate in the physics community and pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in quantum science.\nIn a recent study published in _Nature Communications_ , a team led by M. Zahid Hasan, Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton, used an advanced scanning photocurrent microscope (SPCM) to detect broken symmetries within a charge density wave in KV3Sb5, a topological material with a Kagome lattice structure. Their findings help resolve a major controversy: whether these types of materials can spontaneously break symmetry to form chiral quantum states — a key question with implications for the development of future quantum technologies.\nWhile similar symmetry breaking has been observed in non-topological systems, this marks the first time it has been detected in a bulk topological quantum material, making the discovery especially significant.\n#### A Quantum Telescope for the Invisible\n“This is somewhat like pointing the James Webb telescope at the quantum world and discovering something new,” said Hasan. “We’re finally able to resolve subtle quantum effects that had remained hidden in a topological quantum material.”\nThe Kagome lattice is a two-dimensional geometrical pattern composed of corner-sharing triangles. It is named after a traditional woven bamboo basket pattern that is a common design in Japan and has long been a central platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. For a long time, it was considered inherently achiral, meaning that it lacks handedness. Yet, in 2021, Hasan’s group used a high-resolution scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and discovered that, under certain conditions, KV3Sb5 spontaneously forms an unusual charge density wave — a periodic modulation of electronic density. [This discovery](https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-around-the-world-are-buzzing-about-a-candidate-superconductor-created-at-quantum-foundry/), which resulted in a highly-cited paper in _Nature_ , raised tantalizing questions about whether chirality in the form of a charge order could emerge atop a non-chiral Kagome lattice. The paper is among the three most cited papers in the field because of the issues it has raised.\nA spontaneous charge order in physics is a type of phase transition (like water turning to ice) that occurs when electric charges form non-random patterns. In essence, an ordered state is created from an initially disordered state through a process known as spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nHowever, detecting the specific symmetries broken during this transition have proved notoriously difficult in certain classes of topological materials. Subtle differences between left- and right-handed quantum states in such quantum materials have long eluded conventional measurement techniques.\n#### Revealing Chirality With Light\nTo tackle this, graduate student Zi-Jia Cheng and postdoctoral researcher Shafayat Hossain, two co-lead authors of the paper, engineered a scanning photocurrent microscope capable of detecting this topological material’s nonlinear electromagnetic response under circularly polarized light. This microscope is different from a scanning tunneling microscope, which has typically been used in these types of experiments. The SPCM, though not as high resolution as the STM, is used when the goal is to characterize optically active materials and study their photocurrent behavior at a local scale. A combination of STM and SPCM then provides the complete imaging of the many-body quantum wavefunction.\n“In this set up, we shine and focus coherent light on the sample placed in a specially designed quantum device and as the light interacts with the sample it generates a photocurrent that we can measure,” said Hasan.\nTogether with former postdoctoral fellow Qi Zhang, the researchers fabricated ultra-clean quantum crystal devices and cooled them down to a frigid 4 degrees Kelvin for the measurement.\nAt high temperatures, the photocurrent showed no preference between right- and left-handed circular light. But as the material was cooled past its charge density wave transition, a remarkable shift occurred: the photocurrent became handed, a definitive signature of chirality known as the circular photogalvanic effect.\n#### Measuring Broken Symmetry\nThe researchers achieved this by first shining right-circularly coherent polarized (right-handed) light on the lattice and then measured its current. Then they shined left-handed light and measured its current. They were able to see a very clear difference between the two.\n“Our measurements directly pinpoint broken inversion and mirror symmetries and shed light on the topological nature of this quantum material that exhibits charge order,” said Cheng. “This conclusively establishes the intrinsic chiral nature of the charge-ordered state in a topological material for the first time.”\nDespite this, an explanation for this phenomenon remains elusive. “We confirmed the phenomenon, but we don’t yet have a rigorous theory as to why it occurs,” added Hasan. “We still don’t fully understand it.”\nHowever, the implications stretch beyond basic science. According to Hasan, chiral quantum states could one day power new optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies. “It’s surprising that an emergent chiral state can generate such a pronounced response that was never reported before,” he said. “This work also shows that second-order electromagnetic measurements are a powerful tool for detecting subtle symmetry breakings in topological materials.”\n#### Why Symmetry Breaking Matters\nSymmetry breaking is important because it explains the emergence of ordered states in nature and understanding how the process works is a fundamental goal of scientific investigation. Symmetric theories in physics are frameworks in which the laws governing the universe remain constant under specific conditions. These theories are essential for understanding the universe and, indeed, are fundamental to the advancement of scientific inquiry. However, much of the real world is, in fact, asymmetrical in nature. Therefore, understanding how and under what conditions symmetries are broken is crucial to understanding many concepts in physics, such as phase transitions, magnetism and superconductivity, and topological behaviors, to name a few.\nAs for the future? Hasan is optimistic: “This is just the beginning. With these sensitive tools, who knows what hidden worlds of topological quantum matter we’ll uncover next.”\n#### Legacy and Quantum Frontiers\nThis research’s roots lie in the workings of the quantum Hall effect — a form of topological effect that was the subject of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1985. Since that time, topological phases have been studied and many new classes of quantum materials with topological electronic structures have been found. Most notably, Daniel Tsui, the Arthur Legrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering, Emeritus, at Princeton, won the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the fractional quantum Hall effect. Similarly, F. Duncan Haldane, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton, won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and a type of two-dimensional topological insulator. Subsequent theoretical developments showed that topological insulators can take the form of two copies of Haldane’s model based on electron’s spin-orbit interaction.\nHasan and his research team have been following in the footsteps of these researchers by investigating new aspects of topological quantum materials and searching for novel states of quantum matter. This led them, in 2007, to the discovery of the first examples of three-dimensional topological insulator state. Since then, Hasan and his team have been on a decade-long search for novel quantum properties in topological materials that combine symmetry and topology. The latest discovery shows that certain classes of topological materials can host quantum many-body states that break important symmetries and exhibit spontaneously developed definite chirality at low temperatures.\nReference: “Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order” by Zi-Jia Cheng, Md Shafayat Hossain, Qi Zhang, Sen Shao, Jinjin Liu, Yilin Zhao, Mohammad Yahyavi, Yu-Xiao Jiang, Jia-Xin Yin, Xian Yang, Yongkai Li, Tyler A.

These snapshots confirm decades of theoretical predictions, showing bosons clustering into wave-like formations and fermions forming pairs — mechanisms tied to superconductivity._\n#### Capturing Atoms in the Act\nMIT physicists have captured the first direct images of individual atoms interacting freely in space. These images reveal subtle quantum correlations among these “free-range” particles — behaviors that, until now, had only been predicted by theory. The findings, published in _Physical Review Letters_ , provide a powerful new way to observe elusive quantum phenomena in real space.\nTo create these images, the researchers developed a method that first lets a cloud of atoms move and interact naturally. They then switch on a lattice of light, essentially a grid of laser beams, that momentarily freezes the atoms in place. Using finely tuned lasers, they quickly illuminate the atoms while they’re suspended, capturing their precise positions before the cloud disperses.\n#### Visualizing Quantum Behavior\nUsing this technique, the team was able to photograph clouds of different kinds of atoms and achieve several imaging firsts. They captured images of “[bosons](https://scitechdaily.com/science-made-simple-what-are-bosons-and-fermions/),” which bunched up in a quantum phenomenon to form a wave. They also observed “fermions” pairing up in free space, a key process involved in superconductivity.\n“We are able to see single atoms in these interesting clouds of atoms and what they are doing in relation to each other, which is beautiful,” says Martin Zwierlein, the Thomas A. Frank Professor of Physics at MIT.\nIn the same issue of the journal, two additional research teams reported similar breakthroughs using related techniques. One was led by Nobel laureate Wolfgang Ketterle, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics at MIT, who imaged enhanced pair correlations among bosons. The other team, based at École Normale Supérieure in Paris and led by Tarik Yefsah, visualized a cloud of noninteracting fermions.\nThe study by Zwierlein and his colleagues is co-authored by MIT graduate students Ruixiao Yao, Sungjae Chi, and Mingxuan Wang, and MIT assistant professor of physics Richard Fletcher.\n#### Peering Into the Quantum Cloud\nA single atom is about one-tenth of a nanometer in diameter, which is one-millionth of the thickness of a strand of human hair. Unlike hair, atoms behave and interact according to the rules of quantum mechanics; it is their quantum nature that makes atoms difficult to understand. For example, we cannot simultaneously know precisely where an atom is and how fast it is moving.\nScientists can apply various methods to image individual atoms, including absorption imaging, where laser light shines onto the atom cloud and casts its shadow onto a camera screen.\n“These techniques allow you to see the overall shape and structure of a cloud of atoms, but not the individual atoms themselves,” Zwierlein notes. “It’s like seeing a cloud in the sky, but not the individual water molecules that make up the cloud.”\n#### A Radical New Technique\nHe and his colleagues took a very different approach in order to directly image atoms interacting in free space. Their technique, called “atom-resolved microscopy,” involves first corralling a cloud of atoms in a loose trap formed by a laser beam. This trap contains the atoms in one place where they can freely interact. The researchers then flash on a lattice of light, which freezes the atoms in their positions. Then, a second laser illuminates the suspended atoms, whose fluorescence reveals their individual positions.\n“The hardest part was to gather the light from the atoms without boiling them out of the optical lattice,” Zwierlein says. “You can imagine if you took a flamethrower to these atoms, they would not like that. So, we’ve learned some tricks through the years on how to do this. And it’s the first time we do it in-situ, where we can suddenly freeze the motion of the atoms when they’re strongly interacting, and see them, one after the other. That’s what makes this technique more powerful than what was done before.”\n#### Bosons vs. Fermions in Action\nThe team applied the imaging technique to directly observe interactions among both bosons and fermions. Photons are an example of a boson, while electrons are a type of fermion. Atoms can be bosons or fermions, depending on their total spin, which is determined by whether the total number of their protons, neutrons, and electrons is even or odd. In general, bosons attract, whereas fermions repel.\nZwierlein and his colleagues first imaged a cloud of bosons made up of sodium atoms. At low temperatures, a cloud of bosons forms what’s known as a Bose-Einstein condensate — a state of matter where all bosons share one and the same quantum state. MIT’s Ketterle was one of the first to produce a Bose-Einstein condensate, of sodium atoms, for which he shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nZwierlein’s group now is able to image the individual sodium atoms within the cloud, to observe their quantum interactions. It has long been predicted that bosons should “bunch” together, having an increased probability to be near each other. This bunching is a direct consequence of their ability to share one and the same quantum mechanical wave. This wave-like character was first predicted by physicist Louis de Broglie. It is the “de Broglie wave” hypothesis that in part sparked the beginning of modern quantum mechanics.\n#### Visualizing the de Broglie Wave\n“We understand so much more about the world from this wave-like nature,” Zwierlein says. “But it’s really tough to observe these quantum, wave-like effects. However, in our new microscope, we can visualize this wave directly.”\nIn their imaging experiments, the MIT team were able to see, for the first time in situ, bosons bunch together as they shared one quantum, correlated de Broglie wave. The team also imaged a cloud of two types of lithium atoms. Each type of atom is a fermion, that naturally repels its own kind, but that can strongly interact with other particular fermion types. As they imaged the cloud, the researchers observed that indeed, the opposite fermion types did interact, and formed fermion pairs — a coupling that they could directly see for the first time.\n“This kind of pairing is the basis of a mathematical construction people came up with to explain experiments. But when you see pictures like these, it’s showing in a photograph, an object that was discovered in the mathematical world,” says study co-author Richard Fletcher. “So it’s a very nice reminder that physics is about physical things. It’s real.”\n#### Peeking Into the Quantum Hall Future\nGoing forward, the team will apply their imaging technique to visualize more exotic and less understood phenomena, such as “quantum Hall physics” — situations when interacting electrons display novel correlated behaviors in the presence of a magnetic field.\n“That’s where theory gets really hairy — where people start drawing pictures instead of being able to write down a full-fledged theory because they can’t fully solve it,” Zwierlein says. “Now we can verify whether these cartoons of quantum Hall states are actually real. Because they are pretty bizarre states.”\nReference: “Measuring Pair Correlations in Bose and Fermi Gases via Atom-Resolved Microscopy” by Ruixiao Yao, Sungjae Chi, Mingxuan Wang, Richard J.

The system nicknamed Ansky is the eighth known QPE source and stands out as the most energetic yet. It also breaks records for its timing and duration, producing powerful X-ray outbursts about every 4.5 days, each lasting roughly 1.5 days.\n#### Cracking the Code of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions\n“These QPEs are mysterious and intensely interesting phenomena,” said Joheen Chakraborty, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “One of the most intriguing aspects is their quasi-periodic nature. We’re still developing the methodologies and frameworks we need to understand what causes QPEs, and Ansky’s unusual properties are helping us improve those tools.”\nThe name Ansky comes from ZTF19acnskyy, a visible-light outburst first spotted in 2019. This flare originated in a galaxy about 300 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, and it was the first clue that something unusual was occurring in the region.\nChakraborty is the lead author of a new paper on Ansky, published on May 6 in _The Astrophysical Journal_.\n#### A Gravitational Encounter Behind the Explosions\nA leading theory suggests that QPEs occur in systems where a relatively low-mass object passes through the disk of gas surrounding a [supermassive black hole](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-anatomy-of-a-black-hole/) that holds hundreds of thousands to billions of times the Sun’s mass.\nWhen the lower-mass object punches through the disk, its passage drives out expanding clouds of hot gas that we observe as QPEs in X-rays.\nScientists think the eruptions’ quasi-periodicity occurs because the smaller object’s orbit is not perfectly circular and spirals toward the black hole over time. Also, the extreme gravity close to the black hole warps the fabric of space-time, altering the object’s orbits so they don’t close on themselves with each cycle. Scientists’ current understanding suggests the eruptions repeat until the disk disappears or the orbiting object disintegrates, which may take up to a few years.\n#### Ansky’s Massive Disk May Be the Key\n“Ansky’s extreme properties may be due to the nature of the disk around its supermassive black hole,” said Lorena Hernández-García, an astrophysicist at the Millennium Nucleus on Transversal Research and Technology to Explore Supermassive Black Holes, the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics, and the University of Valparaíso in Chile. “In most QPE systems, the supermassive black hole likely shreds a passing star, creating a small disk very close to itself. In Ansky’s case, we think the disk is much larger and can involve objects farther away, creating the longer timescales we observe.”\nHernández-García, in addition to being a co-author on Chakraborty’s paper, led the [study that discovered Ansky’s QPEs](https://scitechdaily.com/sleeping-black-hole-erupts-in-real-time-blasting-out-record-breaking-x-rays/), which was published in April in Nature Astronomy and used data from NICER, [NASA’s](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/nasa/) [Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/nasa-swift-satellite/) and [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/chandra-x-ray-observatory/), as well as [ESA’s](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/european-space-agency/) (European Space Agency’s) [XMM-Newton](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/xmm-newton/) space telescope.\n#### Mapping the Explosive Details in Real Time\nNICER’s position on the [International Space Station](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/international-space-station/) allowed it to observe Ansky about 16 times every day from May to July 2024. The frequency of the observations was critical in detecting the X-ray fluctuations that revealed Ansky produces QPEs.\nChakraborty’s team used data from NICER and XMM-Newton to map the rapid evolution of the ejected material driving the observed QPEs in unprecedented detail by studying variations in X-ray intensity during the rise and fall of each eruption.\n#### Bubble of Debris Speeds Through Space\nThe researchers found that each impact resulted in about a Jupiter’s worth of mass reaching expansion velocities around 15% of the speed of light.\nThe NICER telescope’s ability to frequently observe Ansky from the space station and its unique measurement capabilities also made it possible for the team to measure the size and temperature of the roughly spherical bubble of debris as it expanded.\n“All NICER’s Ansky observations used in these papers were collected after the instrument experienced a ‘light leak’ in May 2023,” said Zaven Arzoumanian, the mission’s science lead at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Even though the leak, [which was patched in January](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nicer-status-updates/), affected the telescope’s observing strategy, NICER was still able to make vital contributions to time domain astronomy, or the study of changes in the cosmos on timescales we can see.”\n#### A Continuing Cosmic Watch\nAfter the repair, NICER continued observing Ansky to explore how the outbursts have evolved over time. A paper about these results, led by Hernández-García and co-authored by Chakraborty, is under review.\nObservational studies of QPEs like Chakraborty’s will also play a key role in preparing the science community for a new era of multimessenger astronomy, which combines measurements using light, elementary particles, and space-time ripples called gravitational waves to better understand objects and events in the universe.\n#### Preparing for Gravitational Wave Breakthroughs\nOne goal of ESA’s future [LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/lisa/) mission, in which NASA is a partner, is to study extreme mass-ratio inspirals — or systems where a low-mass object orbits a much more massive one, like Ansky. These systems should emit gravitational waves that are not observable with current facilities. Electromagnetic studies of QPEs will help improve models of those systems ahead of LISA’s anticipated launch in the mid-2030s.\n“We’re going to keep observing Ansky for as long as we can,” Chakraborty said. “We’re still in the infancy of understanding QPEs. It’s such an exciting time because there’s so much to learn.”\nReference: “Rapidly Varying Ionization Features in a Quasi-periodic Eruption: A Homologous Expansion Model for the Spectroscopic Evolution” by Joheen Chakraborty, Peter Kosec, Erin Kara, Giovanni Miniutti, Riccardo Arcodia, Ehud Behar, Margherita Giustini, Lorena Hernández-García, Megan Masterson, Erwan Quintin, Claudio Ricci and Paula Sánchez-Sáez, 6 May 2025, _The Astrophysical Journal_.

Their findings, soon to be published in the _Astrophysical Journal Letters_ , reveal that the X-rays are most likely generated through interactions between high-speed electrons and particles of light known as photons.\n#### The X-ray Mystery: Electrons or Protons?\nFor years, scientists debated whether these X-rays originated from electrons or protons within the black hole’s jets. Each scenario leaves a distinct signature in X-ray light’s polarization, which is the preferred orientation of the light’s electromagnetic waves.\nA high degree of polarization would point to protons as the source, either spiraling in magnetic fields or interacting with surrounding photons. On the other hand, a lower degree of polarization would indicate that electrons are responsible, scattering photons in a process known as Compton scattering.\n#### IXPE’s One-of-a-Kind Capabilities in Space\nIXPE, which [launched](https://scitechdaily.com/spacex-rocket-launches-nasas-ixpe-space-observatory-to-explore-the-most-extreme-and-mysterious-objects-in-the-universe/) December 9, 2021, is the only satellite flying today that can make such a polarization measurement.\n“This was one of the biggest mysteries about supermassive black hole jets,” said Iván Agudo, lead author of the study and astronomer at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía – CSIC in Spain. “And IXPE, with the help of a number of supporting ground-based telescopes, finally provided us with the tools to solve it.”\n#### Groundbreaking Discovery Confirms Compton Scattering\nAstronomers found that electrons must be the culprits through a process called Compton Scattering. Compton scattering (or the Compton effect) happens when a photon loses or gains energy after interacting with a charged particle, usually an electron. Within jets from supermassive black holes, electrons move near the speed of light. IXPE helped scientists learn that, in the case of a blazar jet, the electrons have enough energy to scatter photons of infrared light up to X-ray wavelengths.\nBL Lacertae (BL Lac for short) is one of the first blazars ever discovered, originally thought to be a variable star in the Lacerta constellation. IXPE observed BL Lac at the end of November 2023 for seven days along with several ground-based telescopes measuring optical and radio polarization at the same time. While IXPE observed BL Lac in the past, this observation was special. Coincidentally, during the X-ray polarization observations, the optical polarization of BL Lac reached a high number: 47.5%.\n#### Record-Breaking Optical Polarization Observed\n“This was not only the most polarized BL Lac has been in the past 30 years, this is the most polarized any blazar has ever been observed!” said Ioannis Liodakis, one of the primary authors of the study and astrophysicist at the Institute of Astrophysics – FORTH in Greece.\nIXPE found the X-rays were far less polarized than the optical light. The team was not able to measure a strong polarization signal and determined that the X-rays cannot be more polarized than 7.6%. This proved that electrons interacting with photons, via the Compton effect, must explain the X-rays.\n> “The fact that optical polarization was so much higher than in the X-rays can only be explained by Compton scattering.”\n> Steven Ehlert, Project Scientist for IXPE at Marshall Space Flight Center\n“The fact that optical polarization was so much higher than in the X-rays can only be explained by Compton scattering,” said Steven Ehlert, project scientist for IXPE and astronomer at the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n#### A Decade-Long Vision Realized Through IXPE\n“IXPE has managed to solve another black hole mystery,” said Enrico Costa, astrophysicist in Rome at the Istituto di Astrofísica e Planetologia Spaziali of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofísica. Costa is one of the scientists who conceived this experiment and proposed it to NASA 10 years ago, under the leadership of Martin Weisskopf, IXPE’s first principal investigator. “IXPE’s polarized X-ray vision has solved several long lasting mysteries, and this is one of the most important. In some other cases, IXPE results have challenged consolidated opinions and opened new enigmas, but this is how science works and, for sure, IXPE is doing very good science.”\nWhat’s next for the blazar research?\n“One thing we’ll want to do is try to find as many of these as possible,” Ehlert said. “Blazars change quite a bit with time and are full of surprises.”\nReference: “High optical to X-ray polarization ratio reveals Compton scattering in BL Lacertae’s jet” by Ivan Agudo, Ioannis Liodakis, Jorge Otero-Santos, Riccardo Middei, Alan Marscher, Svetlana Jorstad, Haocheng Zhang, Hui Li, Laura Di Gesu, Roger W.

As global temperatures rise, the capacity of polar oceans to absorb carbon from the atmosphere could decline.\nKnies and his team found that rapid environmental changes are reshaping dynamic fjord ecosystems such as Kongsfjorden in Svalbard. Their research shows not only a shift in phytoplankton communities caused by melting ice, but also a concerning reduction in the ability of these fjords to capture and store carbon.\n#### The Hidden World of Phytoplankton\nPhytoplankton form the foundation of Arctic food webs. These microscopic organisms are more than just food for marine life, they are essential to carbon cycling and climate regulation. As sea ice melts, more sunlight penetrates the ocean surface, allowing phytoplankton populations to grow. This triggers a surge of biological activity, attracting fish and marine animals to the newly enriched waters.\nJochen Knies, lead author of the study, highlights this dynamic: “The changes we observe suggest that the future of these fjord ecosystems will depend heavily on how well they adapt to a warmer climate.”\n#### Balancing Growth and Sustainability in a Warming Climate\nWarmer waters can enhance phytoplankton growth during sunlit summers, presenting an initial opportunity for increased productivity. However, as the waters become stratified, essential nutrients become harder to access, leading to a double-edged sword: while we may see a rise in phytoplankton biomass, the efficiency of carbon capture could decline.\nJochen emphasizes this critical point: “While we anticipate greater primary production, the reality is that warmer, stratified waters could hinder the fjords’ ability to serve as effective carbon sinks.”\nFurthermore, the influx of glacial meltwater, like a lifeline for marine life, plays a vital role in reshaping the nutrient landscape of these fjords. As glaciers disappear, this nutrient supply becomes unpredictable, raising concerns about the long-term health of these ecosystems. Without a steady flow of nutrients, the ecological balance may be disrupted, potentially impacting the food web and overall productivity of the fjords.\n#### Looking Ahead: The Arctic as a Climate Barometer\nThe Arctic acts as a vital indicator of global climate change. The world’s focus is drawn to these melting ice caps not just for their beauty, but because they hold significant lessons about our shared future. “The future of Arctic fjords reflects the broader climate challenges we face globally,” Jochen warns.\nReference: “Arctic fjord ecosystem adaptation to cryosphere meltdown over the past 14,000 years” by Jochen Knies, Youngkyu Ahn, Berenice Ebner, Lukas Smik, Kwangchul Jang, Seung-Il Nam, Simon T.

His discovery, which may represent the highest-altitude tree in the state, is detailed in _Madroño_ , a journal of the California Botanical Society.\nLast September, while exploring the south slopes of Mount Kaweah in Sequoia National Park, Safford stopped to admire familiar high-elevation species like foxtail and lodgepole pines.\n“Then I thought, ‘What’s that?’” said Safford, a forest ecologist with the UC Davis Department of Environmental Science and Policy. “I walk over, and it’s a Jeffrey pine! It made no sense. What is a Jeffrey pine doing above 11,500 feet?”\nTypically found in upper montane forests across the Sierra Nevada, the Jeffrey pine is most common around areas like Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Lakes. It is not usually considered a subalpine species, which grow at the highest, most extreme elevations. Yet, Safford recorded Jeffrey pines growing as high as 12,657 feet—1,860 feet higher than the previous elevation record for the species and higher than known occurrences of lodgepole, limber, and even foxtail pines.\nTo date, none of the six traditional subalpine forest species have been collected above 12,034 feet. This suggests the Jeffrey pine is California’s highest tree — at least for the moment. Safford’s work indicates that other species are growing higher than commonly used databases suggest.\nThe discovery signifies a changing climate amid California’s highest peaks. As snow melts earlier and air temperatures rise, Jeffrey pine seeds are germinating on land they previously found frozen and inhospitable.\n#### Moving on up\nDuring his hike-turned-science-expedition, Safford found and examined 14 Jeffrey pines above 11,800 feet elevation, some of which were at least 20 years old. At least a dozen others were visible, but he was unable to visit them. He and researchers from his lab will return to the southern Sierra Nevada this summer to further research Jeffrey pines in the subalpine zone and what is driving their movement.\nFor now, Safford strongly suspects a bird — the Clark’s nutcracker — is lending its well-known, high alpine gardening skills to the task of planting Jeffrey pine trees in the area. Much as this nutcracker does for [whitebark pine trees](https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/scientists-sequence-genome-threatened-whitebark-pine), preliminary evidence suggests the bird carries fleshy Jeffrey pine seeds up the mountain from thousands of feet below, storing them in the High Sierra’s “refrigerator” for an early summer snack.\nEarlier snowmelt and warmer temperatures enable some of these Jeffrey pine seeds to not only germinate but to establish themselves as a new population on the mountain.\n#### Leapfrogging trees\nSpecies attempting to stay ahead of climate changes by moving uphill are doing so far too slowly to keep pace, climate modeling literature suggests. Yet the models do not account for the role of seed dispersal by birds and other species amid shifting windows of ecological opportunity.\n“I’m looking at trees surviving in habitats where they couldn’t before, but they’re also dying in places they used to live before,” Safford said. “They’re not just holding hands and walking uphill. This crazy leapfrogging of species challenges what we think we know about these systems reacting as the climate warms.”\nJeffrey pine trees are tolerant of both cold and drought, so while their lives along the slopes of Mount Kaweah are harsh and somewhat unexpected, their persistence is promising, Safford said.\n#### Trees in real life\nThe discovery underscores a need for scientists to couple powerful technologies with direct observation. The trees Safford encountered were not detected by any available database, artificial intelligence platform, satellite, or remote sensing technology.\n“People aren’t marching to the tops of the mountains to see where the trees really are,” Safford said. “Instead, they are relying on satellite imagery, which can’t see most small trees. What science does is help us understand how the world functions. In this case, where you see the impacts of climate change most dramatically, are at high elevations and high latitudes. If we want our finger on the pulse of how the climate is warming and what the impacts are, that’s where it will be happening first. We just need to get people out there.”\nThis summer, Safford and his students will be out there, hiking along Mount Whitney, Mount Kaweah, and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, identifying seedlings, measuring and identifying trees, and helping to develop models of accurate elevations to better understand the changing landscape of the High Sierra.\nReference: “New Elevation Records for Jeffrey Pine” by Hugh D.

Until now, scientists believed this land uplift was caused by mantle flow within the Earth’s crust.\nHowever, a new study from the [University of Bonn](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-bonn/) suggests a different explanation: droughts and the resulting loss of water are the primary drivers of this vertical movement. The findings have been published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth._\nResearchers have known for years that South Africa is rising, thanks to a network of permanent GPS stations across the country. These stations allow scientists to measure both horizontal position and elevation with millimeter-level precision using satellite data.\n“This data showed an average rise of six millimeters between 2012 and 2020,” says Dr. Makan Karegar of the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation at the University of Bonn, who is also part of the university’s transdisciplinary research area “Sustainable Futures.”\nUntil now, many researchers attributed this rise to a geodynamic process. They theorized that a plume—a massive, tube-like structure carrying hot material from deep within the Earth—exists beneath the region. The upward pressure from this plume could cause the Earth’s crust to bulge, explaining the observed uplift.\n“However, we have now tested another hypothesis,” Karegar explains. “We believe that the loss of groundwater and surface water due to droughts may also be responsible for the land rising.”\n#### Uplift during droughts\nWorking together with Christian Mielke, Dr. Helena Gerdener, and Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kusche from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Karegar investigated this theory in the recently published paper.\nDuring their research, the team examined, among other things, precipitation patterns across the different regions of South Africa and stumbled on some clear parallels in the data: Areas that had suffered severe droughts experienced a particularly pronounced land uplift.\nThe geodesists also compared these results with data from the GRACE satellite mission. The measurement equipment in the GRACE satellites regularly measured any change in gravitational forces in the regions they had just flown over from orbit.\n“These results can be used to calculate, among other things, the change in the total mass of the water storage including sum of surface water, soil moisture and ground water,” explains Christian Mielke. “However, these measurements only have a low spatial resolution of several hundred kilometers.”\n#### Satellite data supports the drought hypothesis\nIt is possible to split South Africa into large planning zones based on the GRACE data and then calculate average values for each zone. Although the satellites only provide a rough picture of the water distribution, they also clearly show that the lower the mass of water in a planning zone, the higher the uplift at the GPS stations in that zone. Hydrological models also supported the hypothesis. These models can show on a computer the influence that droughts have on the water cycle at a very high resolution (in contrast to the GRACE data). “This data also showed that the land uplift could primarily be explained by drought and the associated loss of water mass,” says Mielke.\nIf land masses dry out, the Earth bulges in these locations, similar to a foam ball that was previously held under pressure (although in the case of the land, the pressure was exerted by water). This effect can be used to record the extent of a drought more precisely than ever before – using a method that is comparatively inexpensive and requires less effort. This is especially important because a large proportion of the water reserves are stored underneath the Earth’s surface. People have long been extracting this groundwater via wells for use as drinking water, to water their plants, and also for industrial processes.\nThe permanent GPS receivers can now be used to understand the extent to which these reserves have already been depleted. If needed, this information could be used to decide when it is time to start rationing this valuable resource. This problem is expected to become more serious in the future due to climate change and the resulting change in precipitation patterns. Incidentally, South Africa also acts as a good example here. The country suffered from a devastating drought between 2015 and 2019 when the City of Cape Town lived under the imminent threat of “day zero” – a day completely without water.\nReference: “GNSS Observations of the Land Uplift in South Africa: Implications for Water Mass Loss” by Christian A.

In contrast, a sedentary lifestyle during this period could be harmful to brain health, according to findings published in _Alzheimer’s & Dementia_.\nAn estimated 13% of Alzheimer’s cases worldwide are attributed to physical inactivity. To combat this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults engage in 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity each week.\nWhile regular exercise is known to improve cardiovascular and mental health, both important factors in lowering Alzheimer’s risk, new research indicates that physical activity might also directly affect brain changes linked to the disease.\nThe study, led by Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, researcher at ISGlobal, included 337 participants from the ALFA+ longitudinal cohort, part of the ALFA study (_ALzheimer’s and FAmilies_) at the BBRC, supported by the ”la Caixa” Foundation.\n“We conducted a four-year follow-up of middle-aged residents of Catalonia with a family history of Alzheimer’s disease,” explains Müge Akıncı, doctoral researcher at ISGlobal and the BBRC at the time of the study and first author of the paper.\n“We used physical activity questionnaires to assess changes in activity over a four-year period and neuroimaging tests to analyse the effects of exercise on brain structure and function,” she adds. Participants were classified as adherent (meeting WHO recommendations), non-adherent (doing less than the recommended amount of physical activity), and sedentary (doing zero minutes of physical activity per week).\n#### Benefits of physical activity on brain mechanisms\nBeta-amyloid (Aβ) is a protein that can impair neural communication when it accumulates in the brain and is considered the first pathological event in Alzheimer’s disease. Participants who increased their physical activity to meet WHO-recommended levels showed less beta-amyloid accumulation than those who remained sedentary or reduced their physical activity. Moreover, this effect appeared to be dose-dependent; the greater the increase in activity, the greater the reduction in amyloid burden.\nNon-sedentary participants also showed a greater cortical thickness in brain regions associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Cortical thickness in the medial temporal area is crucial for memory, so its thinning or atrophy (loss of volume) is an early sign of neurodegeneration.\n“Even those who did less physical activity than recommended had greater cortical thickness than sedentary people, suggesting that any amount of exercise, no matter how minimal, has health benefits,” explains Müge Akıncı.\n#### More exercise as a prevention strategy\nThe research team looked at both the increase in physical activity and the adherence to WHO recommendations. They observed that the benefits of physical activity appear to be related to increasing activity over time, rather than reaching a specific activity threshold.\n“These findings reinforce the importance of promoting physical activity in middle age as a public health strategy for Alzheimer’s prevention,” emphasises Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, ISGlobal researcher and lead investigator of the study. “Interventions aimed at promoting increased physical activity could be key to reducing the incidence of the disease in the future,” she concludes.\nReference: “Physical activity changes during midlife link to brain integrity and amyloid burden” by Muge Akinci, Pablo Aguilar-Domínguez, Eleni Palpatzis, Mahnaz Shekari, Marina García-Prat, Carme Deulofeu, Karine Fauria, Judith García-Aymerich, Juan Domingo Gispert, Marc Suárez-Calvet, Oriol Grau-Rivera, Gonzalo Sánchez-Benavides and Eider M.

Using data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, their approach could significantly improve early detection and risk prediction without depending on blood draws or costly procedures.\nThe study is published in  _Communications Medicine_.\n#### Current tests miss early warning signs\nDiabetes, often described as a “silent epidemic,” continues to rise globally, posing major health and economic challenges. Detecting impaired glucose regulation early, before it progresses to Type 2 diabetes, is critical for prevention. However, standard tests often miss these early warning signs, since they rely on intermittent blood samples rather than capturing real-time glucose patterns.\n“Traditional diabetes tests, while useful, do not capture the dynamic nature of glucose regulation under physiological conditions,” said Shinya Kuroda, a professor at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Science and co-author of the current study.\n#### Testing CGM accuracy with advanced analysis\nTo find a more practical alternative, the team turned to CGM, a wearable technology that continuously tracks glucose levels in real time, providing a clearer picture of blood glucose fluctuations in everyday life. Their goal was to identify a CGM-based method for estimating glucose handling capacity, which maintains stable levels, without invasive procedures.\nThe team analyzed 64 individuals without a prior diabetes diagnosis, using a CGM device, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), and clamp tests that are used to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. They then validated their findings with an independent dataset and mathematical simulations.\n#### CGM algorithm detects hidden glucose issues\nTheir analysis showed that AC_Var, a measure of glucose-level fluctuations, strongly correlates with the disposition index, a well-established predictor of future diabetes risk. Moreover, the researchers’ model, which combines AC_Var with glucose standard deviation, outperformed traditional diabetes markers — such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and OGTT results — in predicting the disposition index.\n“By analyzing CGM data with our new algorithm, we identified individuals with impaired glycemic control — even when standard diagnostic tests classified them as ‘normal,’” said Kuroda. “This means we can potentially detect issues much earlier, creating an opportunity for preventive interventions before diabetes is diagnosed.”\nThe team also showed that the method was more accurate than conventional diagnostic indicators in predicting diabetes complications such as coronary artery disease. To facilitate broader access to this approach, the research team has developed a web application that allows individuals and health care providers to easily calculate these CGM-based indices.\n“Our ultimate goal is to provide a practical, accessible tool for widespread diabetes screening,” Kuroda said. “By enabling early detection of glucose regulation abnormalities, we hope to prevent or delay disease onset and reduce long-term complications.”\nReference: “Improved detection of decreased glucose handling capacities via continuous glucose monitoring-derived indices” by Hikaru Sugimoto, Ken-ichi Hironaka, Tomoaki Nakamura, Tomoko Yamada, Hiroshi Miura, Natsu Otowa-Suematsu, Masashi Fujii, Yushi Hirota, Kazuhiko Sakaguchi, Wataru Ogawa and Shinya Kuroda, 22 April 2025,  _Communications Medicine_.

While these substances are found worldwide, regions such as the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific accounted for approximately 75% of the total deaths linked to phthalate exposure.\nPhthalates have long been associated with various health risks. Found in everyday products like cosmetics, cleaning agents, plastic packaging, piping, and insect repellents, they can break down into microscopic particles that enter the body through ingestion or inhalation. Research has linked phthalate exposure to conditions including obesity, diabetes, reproductive problems, and certain cancers.\nThis study, led by researchers at NYU Langone Health, specifically examined di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a common phthalate used in food containers, IV tubing, and other flexible plastics. Prior research has shown that DEHP can trigger chronic inflammation in the arteries, which over time may lead to heart attacks or strokes.\n#### Global Mortality and Economic Impact\nIn their new analysis, the authors estimated that DEHP exposure contributed to 356,238 deaths, or more than 13% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64.\n“By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” said study lead author Sara Hyman, BS, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.\nAccording to the authors, the resulting economic burden from the deaths identified in their study was estimated to be around $510 billion and may have reached as high as $3.74 trillion.\nIn a past study from 2021, the research team tied phthalates to more than 50,000 premature deaths each year, mostly from heart disease, among older Americans. Their latest investigation is believed to be the first global estimate to date of cardiovascular mortality — or indeed any health outcome — resulting from exposure to the chemicals, says Hyman, who is also a graduate student at NYU School of Public Global Health.\nA report on the findings was recently published in the journal _Lancet eBiomedicine._\n#### How the Study Was Conducted\nFor the research, the team used health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys to estimate DEHP exposure across 200 countries and territories. The information included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by the plastic additive. Mortality data was obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research group in the US that collects medical information worldwide to identify trends in public health.\nAmong the key findings, the study showed that losses in the combined region of East Asia and the Middle East and the combined region of East Asia and the Pacific accounted, respectively, for about 42% and 32% of the mortality from heart disease linked to DEHP. Specifically, India had the highest death count at 103,587 deaths, followed by China and Indonesia. The larger heart death risks in these populations held true even after the researchers adjusted their statistical analysis to take into account population size within the studied age group.\nA possible explanation, the authors say, is that these countries face higher rates of exposure to the chemicals, possibly because they are undergoing a boom in plastic production but with fewer manufacturing restrictions than other regions.\n#### Caveats and Future Research\n“There is a clear disparity in which parts of the world bear the brunt of heightened heart risks from phthalates,” said study senior author Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP. “Our results underscore the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins, especially in areas most affected by rapid industrialization and plastic consumption,” added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.\nTrasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health, cautions that the analysis was not designed to establish that DEHP directly or alone caused heart disease and that higher death risks did not take into account other types of phthalates. Nor did it include mortality among those in other age groups. As a result, the overall death toll from heart disease connected to these chemicals is likely much higher, he says.\nTrasande says that the researchers next plan to track how reductions in phthalate exposure may, over time, affect global mortality rates, as well as to expand the study to other health concerns posed by the chemicals, such as preterm birth. Trasande also serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.\nReference: “Phthalate exposure from plastics and cardiovascular disease: global estimates of attributable mortality and years life lost” by Sara Hyman, Jonathan Acevedo, Chiara Giannarelli and Leonardo Trasande, 28 April 2025, _eBioMedicine_.

Scientists had only fragmentary evidence to work with, primarily fossilized teeth and pieces of jawbone.\nNow, a new study based on the most complete skeleton of the species ever discovered has shed significant light on this elusive animal. First described in 1883 by renowned paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, Mixodectes pungens is no longer just a name with scant fossil evidence.\nThe research, co-authored by [Yale](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/yale-university/) anthropologist Eric Sargis, reveals that adult Mixodectes weighed about three pounds, lived in trees, and primarily fed on leaves. The findings also clarify the species’ place in the evolutionary tree, showing that mixodectids, an extinct group of tree-dwelling mammals, are relatively close evolutionary relatives of humans.\n“A 62-million-year-old skeleton of this quality and completeness offers novel insights into mixodectids, including a much clearer picture of their evolutionary relationships,” said Sargis, professor of anthropology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, curator of vertebrate paleontology and mammalogy at Yale Peabody Museum, and the director of the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies. “Our findings show that they are close relatives of primates and colugos — flying lemurs native to Southeast Asia — making them fairly close relatives of humans.”\n#### Field Discovery and Fossil Details\nThe study was published on March 11 in the journal _Scientific Reports._ Stephen Chester, associate professor of anthropology at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, is its lead author.\nThe skeleton was collected in New Mexico’s San Juan Basin by co-author Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, under a permit from the federal Bureau of Land Management. It includes a partial skull with teeth, spinal column, rib cage, forelimbs, and hind limbs.\nThe researchers determined that the skeleton belonged to a mature adult that weighed about 1.3 kilograms, or 2.9 pounds. The anatomy of the animal’s limbs and claws indicate that it was arboreal and capable of vertically clinging to tree trunks and branches. Its molar teeth had crests to break down abrasive material, suggesting it was omnivorous and primarily ate leaves, the study showed.\n“This fossil skeleton provides new evidence concerning how placental mammals diversified ecologically following the extinction of the dinosaurs,” said Chester, a curatorial affiliate of vertebrate paleontology at the Yale Peabody Museum. “Characteristics such as a larger body mass and an increased reliance on leaves allowed _Mixodectes_ to thrive in the same trees likely shared with other early primate relatives.”\n_Mixodectes_ was quite large for a tree-dwelling mammal in North America during the early Paleocene — the geological epoch that followed the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that killed off non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the researchers noted.\nFor example, the _Mixodectes_ skeleton is significantly larger than [a partial skeleton](https://news.yale.edu/2017/05/30/fossil-skeleton-confirms-earliest-primates-were-tree-dwellers) of _Torrejonia wilsoni_ , a small arboreal mammal from an extinct group of primates called plesiadapiforms, that was discovered alongside it. While _Mixodectes_ subsisted on leaves, _Torrejonia’s_ diet mostly consisted of fruit. These distinctions in size and diet suggest that mixodectids occupied a unique ecological niche in the early Paleocene that distinguished them from their tree-dwelling contemporaries, the researchers said.\n#### Evolutionary Relationships Clarified\nTwo phylogenetic analyses performed to clarify the species’ evolutionary relationships confirmed that mixodectids were euarchontans, a group of mammals that consists of treeshrews, primates, and colugos. While one analysis supported that they were archaic primates, the other did not. However, the latter analysis verified that mixodectids are primatomorphans, a group within Euarchonta composed of primates and colugos, but not treeshrews, Sargis explained.\n“While the study doesn’t entirely resolve the debate over where mixodectids belong on the evolutionary tree, it significantly narrows it,” he said.\nReference: “New remarkably complete skeleton of Mixodectes reveals arboreality in a large Paleocene primatomorphan mammal following the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction” by Stephen G.

A raindrop splashing onto the sidewalk. A pile of gravel settling. Historically, such phenomena have rarely caught the attention of physicists, as they seem mundane and devoid of fundamental significance. At the same time, these everyday happenings are also deceptively hard to understand. Out of balance and disordered, they sit outside the comfort zone of the typical physicist.\nBut Sidney Nagel of the University of Chicago is not typical. In the 1970s, he began his career by studying the structure of glass — [a traditional topic](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ideal-glass-would-explain-why-glass-exists-at-all-20200311/) in condensed matter physics. Then he branched out into quirkier, softer forms of matter that the physics community had largely overlooked.\nNagel and his collaborators have developed theories of “jamming” that help explain the flow (or lack of flow) of both sand and traffic. They’ve also stumbled upon new phenomena in droplets and splashes.\n“My deep and abiding feeling is that if you look at anything closely enough, there will be new riches to be found,” Nagel said.\nUnorthodox though it is, his work has been highly impactful and widely celebrated: Nagel won the 1999 Oliver E. Buckley Prize, one of the most coveted awards in condensed matter physics, and the 2023 [Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research](https://www.aps.org/about/news/2022/12/soft-matter-physicist-highest-award) of the American Physical Society.\nHe also takes great pains to capture aesthetically pleasing visuals in the course of his research. Images from his experiments have graced museum walls, an achievement that seems to make Nagel at least as proud as his discoveries do. “When people see this image on the wall, I hope that it makes them feel more enriched,” he said. “It matters that it takes a full human being” — someone capable of appreciating both art and science — “to look at it. There isn’t just one aspect involved.”\n_Quanta_ caught up with Nagel during a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim in March. We sat on a stone bench under the California sun and talked of coffee stains, surprising splashes, and the role of aesthetics in his scientific practice. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n### **Your**[**most cited paper**](https://www.nature.com/articles/39827)**was about the ring-shaped stains left by****drops of coffee on a countertop****. What got you curious about those?**\nI’m not the neatest person. And I need my coffee every morning. So one day I was sitting there waiting for the caffeine to hit, and I noticed that my counter was covered in coffee stains from the day before. I started wondering, “Why do they look so bizarre?”\n### **What looked weird about them?**\nImagine a drop of liquid. It’s tall in the center and comes down at the edges. So there would be more coffee in the middle of the drop. Then when it dries, the stain should be darker in the center with nothing at the edge. But the stains on my counter were the opposite. Everything, all the coffee, was at the outer edge of the rings. We asked a bunch of people why that would be, and everyone gave a different answer.\n### **How did you figure out what was going on?**\nIf you want to understand the cause of something, you should be able to make it go away. But this ring phenomenon was very robust. It works almost everywhere — for example, you see it in the salt stains on the floor from what you track in on your boots in winter. The salt collects at the perimeters of the drops and pools that melted from the slush dripping from your boots. As the drops evaporate, they leave behind white rings of crystallized salt.\nEventually one of my students stopped the edge stain from forming by covering the outer rim of the drop with a glass slide, leaving just the center exposed. That was the key to thinking about the problem.\n### **So why does the coffee all end up at the edge?**\nWe’d been assuming that the overall shape of the drop stays the same as it evaporates, that it just uniformly shrinks in size — a theory that goes back to the work of Thomas Young in the early 1800s. But that’s not what it does. The drop gets pinned to the surface and then evaporates from all over, and especially from the edge. Anything that evaporates from the edge has to be replenished by a flow from the inside. That pulls the coffee to the outside, leaving a stain that’s predominantly at the edges.\n### **What else have you discovered about liquids?**\nWe started wondering what happens when a drop hits a surface and splashes into a bunch of smaller droplets. So first we started recording these beautiful movies of the splashes.\nBut what causes the splash? Can I control the way it breaks up? We had the idea to try this in a vacuum. Without any air to slow the drop down, we figured we’d get a bigger, more violent splash.\n### **What happened?**\nThe splash disappeared! And we fell on the floor laughing hysterically. When we eventually picked ourselves back up, we started to study this effect seriously. People have studied splashing for 100 years, and nobody had thought to take the air out. It’s a stupid experiment! Air is 1,000 times less dense than water; it really shouldn’t make a big difference.\n### **Why does it?**\nWe certainly didn’t think of this right away, but by process of elimination we zeroed in on the competition between the drop trying to expand outward after it hits the surface and the air trying to hold the drop back. Normally, as the liquid expands outward, some air slips underneath and raises it up a bit. Now the edge of the droplet is floating, so it can go much faster than if it were still stuck to the surface. It shoots outward in a corona, which then breaks up. Without air, the drop stays on the surface and never has the chance to splash. So you can have splashes on Earth. But you can’t have them on the moon. Maybe you can have them on Mars where there is at least a little atmosphere.\n### **You’ve looked at sand too. What’s intriguing about sand?**\nLet’s do a little experiment. Pour sand into a container. What’s its density? OK, you write down what you think. Now I tap the container a few times. The height goes down and the density goes up, and not by a small amount! Maybe 10% in some cases.\nThis is not how any “normal” material behaves. I give you a container of water, and you know the density. But if I give you a tube full of some granular material — which includes almost everything you eat in some sense — how do we even describe what I gave you? You don’t know unless I tell you everything I’ve done to the system, that is, how much I’ve shaken it and how much I’ve tapped it.\n### **How should we think about sand, then?**\nIt’s a beautiful example of something that’s disordered and far from thermal equilibrium. Temperature is normally what brings, say, a gas or a liquid into equilibrium by jostling the molecules around. But you’d have to make a room a trillion times hotter before there’d be enough energy for the air to start rearranging the grains of sand. So in that sense, it’s like the sand is incredibly cold. We can let it sit there, and the temperature won’t equilibrate it.\nIn that way it’s a lot like glass, which is what I started out studying in the ’70s. Glass is also this disordered, out-of-equilibrium material that is somewhat but not entirely frozen in place at room temperature.\n### **You’ve studied all sorts of other phenomena, too — the shape of drops as they fall, and materials that deform in useful ways. What kind of physicist do you see yourself as?**\nWeird.\nLook, I don’t know how to really answer that. Clearly, I like things that I consider aesthetically pleasing. That’s very important to me.\nWe’ve spent an incredible amount of time trying to get the photographs of drops just right — not just the physics but the ineffable beauty of the phenomenon. I’m a human being. I’m not just a physicist. So I want this thing we do to appeal to me on the scientific level and the aesthetic level. There’s also something rewarding about seeing what you’re doing directly rather than having it hidden behind some black box of an apparatus, which is what happens so often in certain fields of physics.\n### **A major drive in physics is to reduce the world to its fundamental rules and parts, but you’ve gone in a different direction. Why?**\nWe’re taught to look for finer and finer explanations that take us to a deeper level. And I have a lot of respect for that side of physics. My wife is a particle physicist. But my belief is that our job is also much richer than that. It matters to me all the ways in which nature works, not just the ones that sound esoteric and deep.\nIn some sense I think of doing what has been called “fundamental” physics as like sticking to “modernist” architecture, where form must follow function — a single endeavor. But exciting structures can emerge from pushing away from that single ideal and exploring, for example, postmodern architecture, where buildings can have aspects that are not strictly bounded by their function. We had closed off physics from looking at such weirder things, but this stuff is part of the world too. It is snobby to proclaim that there is only one acceptable way of choosing problems that are worthy of study.\n### **I sense that you’ve faced some resistance or skepticism in your career.**\nYes, here and there. Some pushback came because a few people did not consider certain subjects I studied to be “serious.” Others were upset because I was emphasizing what seemed to them unscientific aspects. We could have captured the same physics without working nearly as hard as we did to perfect the photography, and this made people upset. They said, “You’re a scientist, you’re not supposed to care about things like that.” But it matters to me that you appeal to as many aspects of the human endeavor as you can.\nThat’s why, for me, the idea of having tenure is such a meaningful thing. Most places wouldn’t have encouraged this stuff, but Chicago has been very good to me. I mean, would you give tenure to someone who’s studying coffee stains?\n### **I might. The paper has been cited more than 7,000 times, including by engineers developing inkjet printers and nanotechnology.**\nMaybe now, but not back then. People did not like what I was doing, and they told me so. But, you know, I’ve had a lot of fun.\nThe Quanta Newsletter \n_Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox_\n[ Recent newsletters ](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=0d6ddf7dc1a0b7297c8e06618&id=f0cb61321c)\n## Also in Physics\n[ The Strange Physics That Gave Birth to AI ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-strange-physics-that-gave-birth-to-ai-20250430/)\n[complex systems](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/complex-systems/)\n### [ The Strange Physics That Gave Birth to AI  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-strange-physics-that-gave-birth-to-ai-20250430/)\n_By_ [ Elise Cutts ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/elise-cutts/)\nApril 30, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-strange-physics-that-gave-birth-to-ai-20250430/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ What’s Going On Inside Io, Jupiter’s Volcanic Moon? ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/whats-going-on-inside-io-jupiters-volcanic-moon-20250425/)\n[astronomy](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/astronomy/)\n### [ What’s Going On Inside Io, Jupiter’s Volcanic Moon?  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/whats-going-on-inside-io-jupiters-volcanic-moon-20250425/)\n_By_ [ Robin George Andrews ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/andrews_robin/)\nApril 25, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/whats-going-on-inside-io-jupiters-volcanic-moon-20250425/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ Can Quantum Gravity Be Created in the Lab? ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/can-quantum-gravity-be-created-in-the-lab-20250417/)\n[The Joy of Why](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-why/)\n### [ Can Quantum Gravity Be Created in the Lab?  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/can-quantum-gravity-be-created-in-the-lab-20250417/)\n_By_ [ Steven Strogatz ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/stevenstrogatz/) +1 authors\n[ Janna Levin ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/jannalevin/)\nApril 17, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/can-quantum-gravity-be-created-in-the-lab-20250417/#comments)\nRead Later\n## Next article\nThe Molecular Bond That Helps Secure Your Memories\n[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-molecular-bond-that-helps-secure-your-memories-20250507/)\nLog in to Quanta\n## Use your social network\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mechanix?loginSocial=facebook)\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mechanix?loginSocial=google)\nor\nDon't have an account yet?

An interaction between two proteins points to a molecular basis for memory. \n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-molecular-bond-that-helps-secure-your-memories-20250507/#comments)\nRead Later\n## Introduction\nWhen [Todd Sacktor](https://www.downstate.edu/faculty/pharmacology/sacktor.html) was about to turn 3, his 4-year-old sister died of leukemia. “An empty bedroom next to mine. A swing set with two seats instead of one,” he said, recalling the lingering traces of her presence in the house. “There was this missing person — never spoken of — for which I had only one memory.” That memory, faint but enduring, was set in the downstairs den of their home. A young Sacktor asked his sister to read him a book, and she brushed him off: “Go ask your mother.” Sacktor glumly trudged up the stairs to the kitchen.\nIt’s remarkable that, more than 60 years later, Sacktor remembers this fleeting childhood moment at all. The astonishing nature of memory is that every recollection is a physical trace, imprinted into brain tissue by the molecular machinery of neurons. How the essence of a lived moment is encoded and later retrieved remains one of the central unanswered questions in neuroscience.\nSacktor became a neuroscientist in pursuit of an answer. At the State University of New York Downstate in Brooklyn, he studies the molecules involved in maintaining the neuronal connections underlying memory. The question that has always held his attention was [first articulated in 1984](https://doi.org/10.1038/312101a0) by the famed biologist Francis Crick: How can memories persist for years, even decades, when the body’s molecules degrade and are replaced in a matter of days, weeks or, at most, months?\nIn 2024, working alongside a team that included his longtime collaborator [André Fenton](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/andre-fenton.html), a neuroscientist at New York University, Sacktor offered a potential explanation in a paper published in _Science Advances_. The researchers discovered that [a persistent bond between two proteins](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl0030) is associated with the strengthening of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. Synaptic strengthening is thought to be fundamental to memory formation. As these proteins degrade, new ones take their place in a connected molecular swap that maintains the bond’s integrity and, therefore, the memory.\nThe researchers present “a very convincing case” that “the interaction between these two molecules is needed for memory storage,” said [Karl Peter Giese](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/karl-peter-giese), a neurobiologist at King’s College London who was not involved with the work. The findings offer a compelling response to Crick’s dilemma, reconciling the discordant timescales to explain how ephemeral molecules maintain memories that last a lifetime.\n## **Molecular Memory**\nEarly in his career, Sacktor made a discovery that would shape the rest of his life. After studying under the molecular memory pioneer James Schwartz at Columbia University, he opened his own lab at SUNY Downstate to search for a molecule that might help explain how long-term memories persist.\nThe molecule he was looking for would be in the brain’s synapses. In 1949, the psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that repeatedly activating neurons strengthens the connections between them, or, as the neurobiologist Carla Shatz later put it: “Cells that fire together, wire together.” In the decades since, many studies have suggested that the stronger the connection between neurons that hold memories, the better the memories persist.\nIn the early 1990s, in a dish in his lab, Sacktor stimulated a slice of a rat’s hippocampus — a small region of the brain linked to memories of events and places, such as the interaction Sacktor had with his sister in the den — to activate neural pathways in a way that mimicked memory encoding and storage. Then he searched for any molecular changes that had taken place. Every time he repeated the experiment, he saw elevated levels of a certain protein within the synapses. “By the fourth time, I was like, this is it,” he said.\nIt was protein kinase M zeta, or PKMζ for short. As the rats’ hippocampal tissue was stimulated, synaptic connections strengthened and [levels of PKMζ increased](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.18.8342). By the time he published his findings in 1993, he was convinced that PKMζ was crucial for memory.\nOver the next two decades, he would go on to build a body of work showing that PKMζ’s presence helps maintain memories long after their initial formation. When Sacktor blocked the molecule’s activity an hour after a memory was formed, he saw that synaptic strengthening was reversed. This discovery suggested that PKMζ was “[necessary and sufficient](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn829)” to preserve a memory over time, he wrote in _Nature Neuroscience_ in 2002. In contrast, hundreds of other localized molecules impacted synaptic strengthening only if disrupted within a few minutes of a memory’s formation. It appeared to be a singular molecular key to long-term memory.\nTo test his hypothesis in live animals, he teamed up with Fenton, who worked at SUNY Downstate at the time and had experience training lab animals and running behavioral experiments. In 2006, the duo published their first paper showing that blocking PKMζ could [erase rats’ memories](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1128657) a day or a month after they had formed. This suggested that the persistent activity of PKMζ is required to maintain a memory.\nThe paper was a bombshell. Sacktor and Fenton’s star protein PKMζ gained widespread attention, and labs around the world found that blocking it could erase various types of memories, including those related to fear and taste. PKMζ seemed like a sweeping explanation for how memories form and are maintained at the molecular level. But then their hypothesis lost momentum. Other researchers genetically engineered mice to lack PKMζ, and in 2013, two [independent](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11803) [studies](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11802) showed that these mice could still form memories. This cast doubt on the protein’s role and brought much of the ongoing research to a halt.\nSacktor and Fenton were undeterred. “We knew we had to figure it out,” Sacktor said. In 2016, they [published a rebuttal](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14846), demonstrating that in the absence of PKMζ, mice recruit a backup mechanism, involving another molecule, to strengthen synapses.\nThe existence of a compensatory molecule wasn’t a surprise. “The biological system is not such that you lose one molecule and everything goes. That’s very rare,” Giese said. But identifying this compensatory molecule prompted a new question: How did it know where to go to replace PKMζ? It would take Sacktor and Fenton nearly another decade to find out.\n## **The Maintenance Bond**\nA classic test of a molecule’s importance is to block it and see what breaks. Determined to pin down PKMζ’s role once and for all, Sacktor and Fenton set out to design a way to disrupt it more precisely than ever before. They developed a new molecule to inhibit the activity of PKMζ. It “worked beautifully,” Sacktor said. But it wasn’t clear how.\nOne day in 2020, Matteo Bernabo, a graduate student from a collaborating lab at McGill University, was presenting findings related to the PKMζ inhibitor when a clue emerged from the audience. “I suggested that it worked by blocking the PKMζ’s interaction with KIBRA,” recalled [Wayne Sossin](https://apps.mni.mcgill.ca/research/sossin/), a neuroscientist at McGill.\nKIBRA is a scaffolding protein. Like an anchor, it holds other proteins in place inside a synapse. In the brain, it is abundant in regions associated with learning and memory. “It’s not a protein that a lot of people work on,” Sossin said, but there is considerable “independent evidence that KIBRA has something to do with memory” — and even that it is [associated with PKMζ](https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.12480). Most research has focused on KIBRA’s role in cancer. “In the nervous system,” he said, “there are only three or four of us [studying it].” Sacktor and Fenton joined them.\nTo find out if KIBRA and PKMζ work together in response to synaptic activity, the researchers used a technique that makes interacting proteins glow. When they applied electrical pulses to hippocampal slices, glowing dots of evidence appeared: Following bursts of synaptic activity that produced long-term synaptic strengthening, a multitude of KIBRA-PKMζ complexes formed, and they were persistent.\nThen the team tested the bond during real memory formation by giving mice a drug to disrupt the formation of these complexes. They saw that the mice’s synaptic strength and task memory were lost — and that once the drug wore off, the erased memory did not return, but the mice could acquire and remember new memories once again.\nBut are the KIBRA-PKMζ complexes needed to maintain memory over the long term? To find out, the researchers disrupted the complex four weeks after a memory was formed. Doing so did indeed wipe out the memory. This suggested that the interaction between KIBRA and PKMζ is crucial not only for forming memories, but also for keeping them intact over time.\n“It’s the persistent association between two proteins that maintains the memory, rather than a protein that lasts by itself for the lifetime of the memory,” said Panayiotis Tsokas, a researcher working with Sacktor and lead author on the new _Science Advances_ paper.\nThe KIBRA and PKMζ proteins stabilize each other by forming a bond. That way, when a protein degrades and needs to be replaced, the other remains in place. The bond itself and its location at the specific synapses that were activated during learning are preserved, allowing a new partner to slot itself in, perpetuating the alliance over time. Individually, PKMζ and KIBRA don’t last a lifetime — but by binding to each other, they help ensure your memories might.\nThe discovery helps addresses the conundrum first identified by Crick, namely how memories persist despite the relatively short lifetimes of all biological molecules. “There had to be a very, very interesting answer, an elegant answer, for how this could come about,” Fenton said. “And that elegant answer is the KIBRA-PKMζ interacting story.”\nThis work also answers a question that researchers had put on the shelf. Sacktor’s earlier study showed that increasing levels of PKMζ strengthened synapses and memories. But how did the molecule know where to go within the neuron? “We figured, well, one day, maybe we’ll understand that,” Sacktor said. Now, the researchers think that KIBRA acts as a synaptic tag that guides PKMζ. If true, this would help explain how only the specific synapses involved in a particular physical memory trace are strengthened, when a neuron may have thousands of synapses that connect it to various other cells.\n“These experiments very nicely show that KIBRA is necessary for maintaining the activity of PKMζ at the synapse,” said [David Glanzman](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/david-l-glanzman/), a neurobiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. However, he cautioned that this doesn’t necessarily translate to maintaining memory because synaptic strengthening is not the only model for how memory works.\nGlanzman’s own past research on sea slugs at first appeared to show that disrupting a molecule analogous to PKMζ erases memory. “Originally, I said it was erased,” Glanzman said, “but later experiments showed we could bring the memory back.” These findings prompted him to reconsider whether memory is truly stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections. Glanzman, who has worked for 40 years under the synaptic model, is a recent proponent of an alternative view called the molecular-encoding model, which posits that molecules inside a neuron store memories.\nWhile he has no doubt that synaptic strengthening follows memory formation, and that PKMζ plays a major role in this process, he remains unsure if the molecule also stores the memory itself. Still, Glanzman emphasized that this study addresses some of the challenges of the synaptic model, such as molecular turnover and synapse targeting, by “providing evidence that KIBRA and PKMζ form a complex that is synapse-specific and persists longer than either individual molecule.”\nAlthough Sacktor and Fenton believe that this protein pair is fundamental to memory, they know that there may be other factors yet to be discovered that help memories persist. Just as PKMζ led them to KIBRA, the complex might lead them further still.\nThe Quanta Newsletter \n_Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox_\n[ Recent newsletters ](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=0d6ddf7dc1a0b7297c8e06618&id=f0cb61321c)\n## Also in Biology\n[ AI Is Nothing Like a Brain, and That’s OK ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-is-nothing-like-a-brain-and-thats-ok-20250430/)\n[neuroscience](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/neuroscience/)\n### [ AI Is Nothing Like a Brain, and That’s OK  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-is-nothing-like-a-brain-and-thats-ok-20250430/)\n_By_ [ Yasemin Saplakoglu ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/yasemin-saplakoglu/)\nApril 30, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-is-nothing-like-a-brain-and-thats-ok-20250430/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ How a Biofilm’s Strange Shape Emerges From Cellular Geometry ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-a-biofilms-strange-shape-emerges-from-cellular-geometry-20250421/)\n[biophysics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/biophysics/)\n### [ How a Biofilm’s Strange Shape Emerges From Cellular Geometry  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-a-biofilms-strange-shape-emerges-from-cellular-geometry-20250421/)\n_By_ [ Carrie Arnold ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/carrie-arnold/)\nApril 21, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-a-biofilms-strange-shape-emerges-from-cellular-geometry-20250421/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ Touch, Our Most Complex Sense, Is a Landscape of Cellular Sensors ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/touch-our-most-complex-sense-is-a-landscape-of-cellular-sensors-20250416/)\n[perception](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/perception/)\n### [ Touch, Our Most Complex Sense, Is a Landscape of Cellular Sensors  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/touch-our-most-complex-sense-is-a-landscape-of-cellular-sensors-20250416/)\n_By_ [ Ariel Bleicher ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/ariel-bleicher/)\nApril 16, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/touch-our-most-complex-sense-is-a-landscape-of-cellular-sensors-20250416/#comments)\nRead Later\n## Next article\nDimension 126 Contains Strangely Twisted Shapes, Mathematicians Prove\n[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/dimension-126-contains-strangely-twisted-shapes-mathematicians-prove-20250505/)\nLog in to Quanta\n## Use your social network\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mechanix?loginSocial=facebook)\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mechanix?loginSocial=google)\nor\nDon't have an account yet?

After all, adding another dimension simply creates a new direction to move around in. It doesn’t change the defining features of space: its endlessness and its uniformity.\nBut different dimensions have decidedly different personalities. In dimensions 8 and 24, it’s possible to [pack balls together](https://www.quantamagazine.org/sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions-20160330/) especially tightly. In other dimensions, there are “exotic” spheres that look irremediably crumpled. And dimension 3 is the only one that can contain knots — in any higher dimension, you can untangle a knot even while holding its ends fast.\nNow, mathematicians have put the finishing touches on a story of dimensional weirdness that has been 65 years in the making. For many decades, researchers have wanted to know which dimensions can host particularly strange shapes — ones so twisted that they cannot be converted into a sphere through a simple procedure called surgery. The existence of these shapes, mathematicians have shown, is intimately intertwined with fundamental questions in topology about the relationships between spheres of different dimensions.\nOver the years, mathematicians found that the twisted shapes exist in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30 and 62. They also showed that such shapes could not possibly exist in any other dimension — save one. No one could determine the status of dimension 126.\nThree mathematicians have now settled this final problem. In a [paper posted online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879) last December, [Weinan Lin](https://waynelin92.github.io/) and [Guozhen Wang](https://pouiyter.github.io/) of Fudan University in Shanghai, along with [Zhouli Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuzhouli) of the University of California, Los Angeles, proved that 126 is indeed one of the rare dimensions that can host these strangely twisted shapes.\nIt’s “a very long program, finally finished,” said [Ulrike Tillmann](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/), a mathematician at the University of Oxford and the director of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences.\nThe proof, which uses a combination of computer calculations and theoretical insights, is “like a monumental engineering project,” said [Michael Hopkins](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/) of Harvard University. “It’s just jaw-dropping how they did it.”\n## **The Doomsday Hypothesis**\nIn the 1950s, the mathematician [John Milnor](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jack/) astonished the mathematical world by showing that dimension 7 is [home to “exotic” spheres](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=0082103). An exotic sphere looks exactly like an ordinary sphere from the perspective of topology, which only considers the features of a shape that don’t change when it is stretched or deformed. But the two spheres have incompatible definitions of smoothness — a curve that’s smooth on an ordinary sphere might not be considered smooth on an exotic sphere. Milnor was eager to explore and classify these exotic spheres, which in some dimensions turned out to be rare and in others numbered in the thousands.\nTo do this, he [introduced a technique](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=0130696) called surgery, a controlled way to simplify a mathematical shape, or manifold, and potentially convert it into an exotic sphere. The method would become essential to the study of manifolds more generally.\nAs its name suggests, surgery involves slicing out a piece of a manifold and then sewing in one or more new pieces along the boundary of the cut. You must sew in these new pieces smoothly, without creating sharp corners or edges. (When it comes to questions about twisted shapes, mathematicians also require the surgery to respect the manifold’s “framing,” a technical attribute of how the manifold sits in space.)\nTo see this process in action, let’s surgically transform a torus (the two-dimensional surface of a doughnut) into a sphere (the two-dimensional surface of a ball):\nThe result is an ordinary sphere — in fact, there are no 2D exotic spheres. But in certain dimensions, surgery converts some manifolds into ordinary spheres and others into exotic spheres. And sometimes, there’s yet another possibility: manifolds that can’t be converted into a sphere at all.\nTo visualize this last scenario, we can again look at a torus, only this time we’ll give it some special twists to obstruct surgeries:\nMathematicians have proved that there is no surgery that can transform this twisted torus into a sphere, whether regular or exotic. It’s an entirely different class of manifold.\nIn 1960, the French mathematician Michel Kervaire came up with an [invariant](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02565940) — a number you can calculate for a given smooth manifold — that equals zero when the manifold can be surgically converted into a sphere, and 1 when it cannot. So the ordinary torus has a Kervaire invariant of zero, while the twisted torus has a Kervaire invariant of 1.\nKervaire used his invariant to explore the menagerie of possible manifolds in different dimensions. He even used it to come up with a 10-dimensional manifold that has no Kervaire invariant, either zero or 1 — meaning that this manifold must be so crooked that it can have no sensible notion of smoothness at all.\nNo one had imagined that such a manifold could exist. Faced with the power of the new invariant, mathematicians rushed to determine the Kervaire invariants of manifolds in different dimensions.\nWithin a few years, they’d proved that twisted manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1 exist in dimensions 2, 6, 14 and 30. These dimensions fit a pattern: Each number is 2 less than a power of 2 (for example, 30 is 25 − 2). In 1969, the mathematician William Browder [proved that dimensions of this form](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970686?origin=crossref) are the only ones that might host shapes with a Kervaire invariant of 1.\nIt was natural to assume that twisted manifolds would exist in all dimensions of this form: 62, 126, 254 and so forth. Based on this assumption, one mathematician even built an entire edifice of conjectures about exotic spheres and other shapes. But the possibility that the original assumption might be false still loomed. It came to be known as the doomsday hypothesis, since it would falsify all these other conjectures.\nAnd indeed, while mathematicians showed in 1984 that [twisted manifolds exist in dimension 62](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/jlms/s2-30.3.533), no one could prove that such manifolds exist in any of the remaining dimensions. As search after search came up dry, mathematicians eventually ran out of steam, and the problem became a backwater.\nIn 2009, “to stem the tide of oblivion,” the mathematician [Victor Snaith](https://victorsnaith.com/) wrote a book exploring the implications of having manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1 in all the dimensions on Browder’s list. But, Snaith warned in the preface, “this might turn out to be a book about things which do not exist.”\nIf Snaith had published his book a year later, it might have read very differently. For within weeks of the book’s publication, Hopkins and two other researchers confounded mathematicians by announcing that Snaith’s warning to readers had been all too apt: The doomsday hypothesis was true. Manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1, [they had proved](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3724), cannot exist in dimensions 254 and higher.\nThe result left mathematicians in a curious position. Out of the entire infinitude of possible shapes in possible dimensions, the shapes in precisely one dimension still resisted classification. In the words of [Douglas Ravenel](https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/), a mathematician at the University of Rochester and one of the co-authors of the doomsday-hypothesis proof, there was “a big loose end.” It took the form of dimension 126.\n## **Surviving to Infinity**\nIn 2011, Zhouli Xu arrived at the University of Chicago as a new graduate student planning to study computational aspects of manifolds. His adviser, [Peter May](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/), proposed the problem of dimension 126, which mathematicians thought was likely to involve massive computations. May sent Xu to Mark Mahowald of Northwestern University, an expert on the Kervaire invariant problem who had even named his sailboat after one of its key symbols — θj, or “Thetajay.”\nBut Mahowald, who died in 2013, immediately vetoed the proposal. The dimension 126 problem was too hard, he told Xu — “a lifelong problem.” Instead, he guided the young mathematician toward related problems [in lower dimensions](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2017/186-2/p03).\nBut for Xu, the dimension 126 problem remained “a constant source of fascination,” he said.\nThe potential strategy to settle the problem was no mystery. Mathematicians had long known that crucial secrets about exotic spheres and other manifolds are encoded in objects known as [stable homotopy groups](https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-old-conjecture-falls-making-spheres-a-lot-more-complicated-20230822/) of spheres. These are collections of functions, or “mappings,” that send points from a high-dimensional sphere to a lower-dimensional one.\nImagine, for instance, a mapping that sends every point in a 44-dimensional sphere to a point in a 33-dimensional sphere. This mapping essentially crushes down 11 dimensions’ worth of the bigger sphere. If you choose some point on the smaller sphere and find all the points on the bigger sphere that got mapped to it, these points will typically form an 11-dimensional manifold.\nNow consider all the different points on your smaller sphere. Roughly speaking, each point gives you another 11-dimensional manifold. So your mapping doesn’t just create a single 11-dimensional manifold. It creates a bucket of 11-dimensional manifolds.\nA stable homotopy group is a set in which each element is a collection of mappings like this one.\nMathematicians knew that to settle the Kervaire invariant question in a given dimension, they only needed to understand the [stable homotopy group](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=0148075) for that dimension. There’s just one difficulty: Understanding stable homotopy groups is one of the most challenging and foundational problems in topology. “I do not expect it to be solved within the lifetime of my granddaughters,” Ravenel said.\nSo instead, mathematicians approach this problem by degrees. Since 1958, they’ve been organizing information about the structure of stable homotopy groups into an enormous but unfinished atlas of dots called the [Adams spectral sequence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02564578).\nImagine a book with an infinite number of pages, each of which consists of infinitely many columns of dots. Let’s open the book and examine a single page. Each column on this page represents a dimension. Each dot in a given column represents a different potential “flavor” for sphere mappings in that dimension. The flavor always comes in two types, like “regular” or “extra-crispy” (or, say, Kervaire invariant zero or 1).\nIn some ways, the book is exceedingly repetitive — each page has the same list of columns, and many of the same dots in each column. But as you turn the pages, you’ll notice a key difference: Each page captures successively finer details of sphere mappings and manifolds. The atlas’s early pages are only approximations of the truth. The approximations get better as you turn the pages, until on the final page of the atlas — known as the “infinity” page — the representation is perfect.\nNavigating the atlas is like exploring the universe of manifolds with increasingly powerful telescopes. On page 1, the details of each manifold are hazy, and many manifolds that don’t really belong have been erroneously included. But if you make a better telescope, you may be able to detect that a manifold has some “flaw” that would exclude it from the atlas. In that case, you would delete the relevant dot on all subsequent pages of the atlas. If your telescope doesn’t find any flaws, then the dot survives to the next page, where you might hope to turn an even stronger telescope on it.\nIn 1969, Browder showed that [one specific dot](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970686?origin=crossref) in the 126th column of the atlas holds the key to the Kervaire invariant problem in that dimension. If this dot survives to the infinity page, then buckets of 126-dimensional manifolds must come in both flavors: Half of the buckets will consist of manifolds with Kervaire invariant zero, and half will consist of manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1. If the dot doesn’t survive, then 126-dimensional manifolds come in just one flavor, Kervaire invariant zero.\nFor the special dot in column 126, there were 105 different hypothetical ways that it might vanish before the infinity page. To get a handle on these possibilities, Xu partnered with Guozhen Wang, his longtime collaborator and former college roommate. As they developed new computational techniques, they passed them along to Weinan Lin, a mathematician Xu had known since graduate school. Lin wrote a program that was able to rule out 101 of the possibilities. Then, over the course of another year, the researchers painstakingly developed new methods to rule out the last four. Browder’s special dot, they concluded, does survive to the infinity page — meaning that dimension 126 has manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1.\nPrior to the team’s announcement, mathematicians thought such a computation was way out of reach, Hopkins said. The new work is “heroically computational,” he added. Its methods may eventually help mathematicians chart even more of the giant atlas.\nWhile the new paper proves that strangely twisted shapes exist in dimension 126, it gives no hint of how to construct them. Researchers have identified specific twisted shapes in the first four special Kervaire dimensions: 2, 6, 14 and 30. But no one has found one yet in dimension 62 or 126, even though in each dimension where these shapes exist, they make up fully half of all possible shapes. Despite their abundance, “we can’t actually point to one,” Tillmann said.\nIf mathematicians do figure out how to construct twisted shapes in dimensions 62 and 126, it might give them some clue about what makes these six dimensions special — why it’s possible to build such twisty shapes in those and only those dimensions. “Usually when [something like] that happens, there’s some very beautiful construction,” Hopkins said. “It’s very ephemeral, because it’s got to only work five or six times, and not infinitely many times.” The new work “makes it more inspiring to really try to find the special construction of these six things.”\nAnd the Kervaire problem is just one type of dimensional weirdness encoded in the Adams spectral sequence. The special Kervaire dimensions correspond to six special dots in the second row of the atlas. Recently, Xu and [Robert Burklund](https://burklund.github.io/) of the University of Copenhagen [figured out](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-024-01298-6) that a handful of special dimensions seem to exhibit another kind of oddball behavior in the third row of the atlas. No one knows yet what kind of strange manifolds correspond to the special dots in these dimensions — but mathematicians hope to find out.\nDiscoveries about subsequent rows will likely also be forthcoming, Xu said. “There should be a lot more stories later on, waiting for us to explore.”\nThe Quanta Newsletter \n_Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox_\n[ Recent newsletters ](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=0d6ddf7dc1a0b7297c8e06618&id=f0cb61321c)\n## Also in Mathematics\n[ Mathematical Beauty, Truth and Proof in the Age of AI ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematical-beauty-truth-and-proof-in-the-age-of-ai-20250430/)\n[foundations of mathematics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/foundations-of-mathematics/)\n### [ Mathematical Beauty, Truth and Proof in the Age of AI  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematical-beauty-truth-and-proof-in-the-age-of-ai-20250430/)\n_By_ [ Jordana Cepelewicz ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/jordana-cepelewicz/)\nApril 30, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematical-beauty-truth-and-proof-in-the-age-of-ai-20250430/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ New Proof Settles Decades-Old Bet About Connected Networks ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-proof-settles-decades-old-bet-about-connected-networks-20250418/)\n[graph theory](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/graph-theory/)\n### [ New Proof Settles Decades-Old Bet About Connected Networks  ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-proof-settles-decades-old-bet-about-connected-networks-20250418/)\n_By_ [ Leila Sloman ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/leila-sloman/)\nApril 18, 2025\n[ ](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-proof-settles-decades-old-bet-about-connected-networks-20250418/#comments)\nRead Later\n[ Where Does Meaning Live in a Sentence?

A big challenge is that LLMs are black boxes; they can make predictions and decisions on the order of words, but they cannot communicate the reasons for doing so.\n[Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/) at Brown University is building models that could help understand how LLMs process language compared with humans.

Hi.\n**STROGATZ:** Hey Janna, how’s it going?\n**LEVIN:** Good. I wanted to tell you about this conversation I had about AI and large language models, but it took turns so I’m interested to see your reaction to it. Have you been thinking about AI a lot right now? Is it on your mind?\n**STROGATZ:** Sure, can’t resist.

I mean, it’s not as though I can explain to you the neuroscience of my mind as I’m talking to you, right? I don’t know how this black box is working.\n**STROGATZ:** There’s an old essay by Louis Thomas, at one point says something like, if I had to do consciously what my liver does, I would just be vibrating, you know.\n**LEVIN:** Right. A lot of what we consider consciousness, I sometimes think is because we can’t process that much data. So we need the consciousness as a very quick approximation so we can do lots of tasks. We have to be able to breathe automatically. We have to be able to recognize a chair versus a person instantly and loosely. And these have all been difficult things to teach an AI.\n**STROGATZ:** Oh, huh… because of its nature to want to be exact?\n**LEVIN:** I mean, I guess the AI will have to learn. The fact that it makes mistakes to me is almost reassuring.\n**STROGATZ:** Oh, that’s interesting. What a cool thought because we so often make fun of them for hallucinating and that never occurred to me that that might be a sign of being on the road to real intelligence.\n**LEVIN:** I think these advances in AI and language specifically these large language models have been really intriguing, So I had the chance to talk with Ellie Pavlick. She’s a computer scientist and linguist at Brown University. And she heads this Language Understanding and Representation Lab, which is trying to understand not just language and language models, but how they actually work. And we had a chance to talk about all of this. So, let’s hear from Ellie.\n**STROGATZ:** Fantastic.\n[_Music plays_]\n**LEVIN:** So, Ellie, welcome to The Joy of Why. We’re thrilled to have you today.\n**ELLIE PAVLICK:** Thank you. Yeah.\n**LEVIN:** This topic is really all over the news right now, and it’s in our lives, actually, this issue of AI. Before we get too deep into it, I’m curious about your own trajectory. You started in economics and you started playing saxophone. How did you go from that to studying computers and how they encode semantics?\n**PAVLICK:** I always wish I had a really like, literary answer where all comes full circle. It’s like, only because I began where I did, could I have ended up where I am.\n**LEVIN:** Some profound life lesson.\n**PAVLICK:** Exactly. It turns out it wasn’t like scripted and perfect. So, I think the path into CS was very much through econ because I had a research gig with a microeconomics professor, and the grunt work I was given was to like make plots in MATLAB and that was overwhelming for someone with no CS background. And I was like, okay, maybe I need to learn how to code. So, I took an intro class, just so I didn’t feel so out of my element, and there’s this very pleasant nature to like writing a little thing and running it and it works and it does what you said.\nAnd then I’ve always thought I liked the idea of research, so I started working with the one professor who was doing language stuff. But then really kept working with him because he was working more and more on semantics, and that resonated like that, like, tapped into something I think I was always interested in.\n**LEVIN:** Slightly the overachievers response. I have to make a plot, therefore I must get a degree in computer science.\n**PAVLICK:** It I wish it was that, but I think it was like absolute confusion about what, like what I didn’t know what skill I was missing.\n**LEVIN:** Right.\n**PAVLICK:** I was just like, I don’t even understand what’s going on. I don’t even know what question to ask.\n**LEVIN:** So I can imagine years ago, if you had said to somebody, oh, I work on how computers encode semantics at a dinner party. You might have ended the conversation, but these days has reaction changed when you tell people you’re working on things like large language models?\n**PAVLICK:** Absolutely. I’ve said this as like a blessing and a curse. So I used to say I do natural language processing, which is getting computers to understand languages like English or Chinese or Spanish as opposed to computer languages like Python or Java.\nAnd yeah, most people were zoned out, but now it’s like an open invitation to talk about all of the kind of science philosophical questions that’s on everyone’s mind.\n**LEVIN:** And we’re gonna ask you all of those too. Before we get into the philosophical aspects, which I do believe you integrate into your work, give us a little synopsis of what it is that you do. You said natural language processing. You said large language models, LLMs.\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. So natural language processing is like the broader field that kind of gave rise to LLMs that could encompass anything that involves getting computers to work with human language. NLP isn’t really about the approach you’re using, it’s about the kinds of problems you’re trying to solve.\nSo before large language models, maybe you would have something like a sentiment classifier or a spam filter or information retrieval like Google search or machine translation, right? All of these tasks would be NLP and they might use machine learning or they might not. And if they use machine learning, they might use neural networks and deep learning, or they might not.\nAnd so then large language models are like one type of model that are neural networks predicting the next word. And it’s turned out that as a consequence of building these things, they can be used to solve lots of different tasks. And so there’s this feeling that they’re subsuming a lot of the things that traditionally other models in NLP were being created to solve. But definitely I would say NLP is a broad field that cares about solving language problems using computational tools.\n**LEVIN:** Excellent. And then what exactly is it that you’re looking into around things like large language models and ChatGPT?\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. So right now, when I talk about what my lab does, we’re basically working on large language models. The kinds of questions we’re really interested in is the same questions we would’ve asked about humans and still do ask about humans, which is just like, how do they represent language such that they do the things they do, right? What does it mean to represent language and how does that representation of language support the various kinds of interesting linguistic behavior that we get and other behavior.\nNow that you have language models that produce often human-like behavior — and then sometimes a little bit alien, weird behavior — but obviously are so linguistic in a way that non-human things have never been before. It’s just interesting to ask how they do it, and then ask in what ways is that the same or different from humans, and is that a difference that really matters for something we might care about, like comprehension or meaning?\n**LEVIN:** Hmm. So let’s think about this relationship between how these large language models are processing language versus how humans are. I think that’s very intriguing. Now I understand why we don’t have immediate transparency and how humans are processing language. We didn’t make humans. Evolution made humans, and we are these black boxes. We can interrogate ourselves. We can self-reflect, we can analyze other humans. Why is a computer a black box, if it’s human made? That is something I think people struggle with. What do you mean you don’t know how it’s doing what it’s doing? You made it.\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. It’s somewhat unique where we are right now, that it’s a computational system that we’re treating as though it’s an organic system, like as though it was created by something that wasn’t us. It’s a hard one to answer because you really have to answer with some kind of an analogy and it’s like, what’s the right analogy?\nSo the direct answer is like, well we understand the actual code we wrote. You can go through line by line and say this is what this line of code is doing. But what that code is doing is it’s calling a machine learning program, which means it’s setting up a set of principles and rules, but then the model’s going to follow these to gradually fit patterns of data, right? We understand the basic constraints on how that learning happens, but you can’t then explain exactly the system that comes out the other side. And in particular, you can’t explain why the system that comes out has the properties and the behaviors it does. There’s not a direct kind of reduction of the behavior you see from an LLM to the lines of code and the principles that that gave rise.\nSo there’s different analogies you can play with. One I really like is we have a recipe for how to make large language models and you can understand the recipe, like you know what the steps are that you’re doing and you understand some levels. Like, if I don’t put baking soda in the cake, it will turn out… I actually don’t know what’ll happen, I’m not a very good baker. Like it’ll turn out too flat, too chewy, something. And you can even do some kind of substitutes like, oh, if I don’t have eggs, I can use smashed banana or whatever, and it’ll have these different consequences, but that doesn’t mean you understand the chemistry. Like you can’t precisely say exactly why the cake is this exact way that it turned out.\nAnd so I think there’s like an important distinction to manage from being able to build something or create something and understanding how it works. And as we’ve moved towards machine learning and deep learning that just pulls those two things apart\n**LEVIN:** So, the large language model — do I call it a computer. It must be a network of computers. How do I refer to this entity? I don’t want to anthropomorphize.\n**PAVLICK:** I actually think this is an interesting issue even in like how to talk about them. Because they’re producing behaviors that until recently only humans produced. We just don’t have the language for talking about that thing without using anthropomorphized language.\n**LEVIN:** So, you call them LLMs?\n**PAVLICK:** I call them large language models. And they sometimes are on one computer. There’s sometimes on many computers. It’s like a virtual entity. It’s not a physical entity.\n**LEVIN:** It’s a meta something. So, here’s this meta black box that’s still a mystery. Why can’t we ask it? Hey, what are you doing? How’d you do that?\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. So, we have a complicated mathematical model. The whole goal of which is to say, given a sequence of words, predict the next word. So, if I just say I just saw a school bus drive past my house, car, yard, whatever, like, you can predict what the next word might be. And that’s primarily what they’re optimized to do. That’s what they’re designed to do and then they’re doing all kind of crazy math to support that.\nBut then if you say something like, why did you just say what you said? The objective is not to faithfully explain why it just said what it said — if it even knows what “you” refers to here, which it doesn’t — but instead to say what kinds of words are likely to come next after that question, right? And it’s gonna be sourcing its understanding of what’s likely to come next from having seen lots and lots of data of questions similar to that, followed by answers.\nAnd so that in and of itself is completely untethered to any reference to the language model’s internal state, for example. The way the systems are designed and trained, right, there’s absolutely nothing that constraints its answer to this question to be useful or correct or accurate. There’s nothing that guarantees that its explanation of its behavior not only is not right, but has anything to do with its behavior.\nAnd we have some studies that look at these explanations where we’re trying to see how much, what it explains its behavior actually aligns with what it does. And I’ve just been surprised by the degree to which they are consistent with each other and we’re trying to figure out why that is, because there’s nothing that would objectively require it.\nIt’s the same kind of argument of like, why can’t I just ask you, like, how your nervous system works, how your brain works. Like, you’re using it, you’re using it to not know. Like, it’s your brain that’s telling me you don’t know how your brain works, right? And you’re like, what do you mean?\nOf course, the mechanism by which the language model doesn’t know how it works is very different than the mechanism by which humans don’t know how they work. But it’s still this kind of point that those two things don’t really operate that way.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah, it does make me wonder if trying to crack the neuroscience of how a human mind works, will be equally challenging problems in parallel. Are you working on sort of neuroscience aspects in how to think about this?\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah, that’s a direction I’ve been super excited about every time you work with a new discipline, it just brings in a whole new set of types of ways of thinking about things, terminology, insights, right? So it brings new stuff. There are ways in which I think neuroscience is going to be very informative here on certain aspects.\nWe often talk in AI and in cognitive science about levels of analysis, which is just saying there’s many different ways to understand a system. It’s like this idea that like what level should we be trying to understand them.\nIf we’re trying to analogize them to humans, is it more like the brain? Is it more like the mind? Is it more like society? Is it like a chaotic system that’s more like multiple people and we’re looking at emergent behavior because it is trained on the whole internet?\nAnd there’s nothing that’s like the one true analogy. And so neuroscience brings this really low-level way of thinking about how might lot of small numerical operations allow certain more complex behaviors to emerge, and cognitive science can provide other kinds of insights.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah. So, but we do know some things that they’re doing. Which, for instance, they’re looking at these semantic relationships as you described. they’re guessing what word comes next. And they’re doing this mathematically. How has that process achieved for them?\n**PAVLICK:** So there’s different types of math that are relevant here. The go-to is like the probabilistic model, estimating what are the probability of the next words. And so you’re just saying, I’ve seen a set of words so far and I need to encode this into some state. And then you’re saying, what is the probability of a next word given this state?\nBut then something that becomes quite complex, and one of the reasons they are harder to explore is that the way of representing that state, it’s not like the coin-flipping example where you say it’s either heads or it’s tails, right, ‘cause there’s an infinite number of these things. And so the way that gets encoded is more of a linear algebraic notion or even more calculus. It’s like this high dimensional space where there’s a ton of different states here, and it’s really hard to know exactly what the shape of this thing is and how you move around it.\nAnd so this is where a lot of the complexity comes in. Like on the one hand, we can fairly easily think about the probability of next word given a state, and we can think about, kind of, there are similar states in this space and similar states will give rise to similar probabilities.\nThere’s stuff we understand about that, but it’s not at a complete enough level that we can, for example, place guarantees or even predict the behavior of a system without just running it.\n**LEVIN:** I know that you’ve been really careful not to invest too much emotion in this idea that they’re thinking. But how can we tell what they’re understanding or if they know the information that’s being provided?\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. I wouldn’t say I don’t invest emotion in this. I feel like I’ve, I spent a lot of time thinking about this and worrying about it and caring about it. But I haven’t picked a side because, like, the thing that I’m most excited about in terms of what we can get from language models is being forced to be precise about what we mean by these things.\nSo the thing I’m quite sure, like, no, they’re not human like in these intangibles that we’re thinking about when we ask these questions about like meaning and understanding and stuff. I don’t think they have it, but I think the thing that’s so hard is how intangible that thing is.\nThe truth is we don’t know what those words mean. We don’t really know what we mean when we say those things. Like understanding, meaning, thinking, knowing like any of these very anthropomorphized, very loaded words.\nWe kind of know how little we understand what those things mean because when we talk we have to say stuff like, “Yeah, they know, but they don’t really know,” and bank on the fact that the person we’re talking with kind of gets it. Like these are very intuitive concepts and what LLMs are forcing us to do is make them precise and scientific. And I think my feeling is as we try to do that, these words will very much fall apart into many smaller concepts that can be made precise.\nSo the thing that we refer to as knowing or understanding is not one thing that you have or you don’t have. It’s like a shorthand for a collection of things, one of which might just be being human, right? Like it might be that part of what we mean when we say “really know” or “really understand” is being a human and having all these other properties, like making a correct prediction given a certain thing, and making these inferences and behaving consistently across so many states or whatever.\nBut I think that none of these words are actually, they’re just not scientific words. And we are, like, feeling obligated as scientists to confront them. So the thing I stubbornly push back on is saying whether or not they’re thinking. Because on some aspects of what it means to be thinking they are right. And it’s actually more productive to, say what are we actually going for? What does it mean? And very importantly, why does it matter? If we’re asking it for some technical, practical reason, they might be good enough for many cases. If we’re asking it for so much deeper, much more existential reason, then they’re probably not. But like actually teasing those apart is really important.\n**LEVIN:** It’s interesting to me that you’re not dismissing it outright. You’re not saying, “No, it’s just MATLAB,” you know, which is a kind of computer code that you can write. But you’re not doing that right now, which is very intriguing.\n**PAVLICK:** I’m not, and definitely not everyone in my field. A lot of people in my field really don’t reserve anything in the human mind that’s not computational, right? So saying something like it’s just math is like a weird dismissal. It’s not clear to me that that same thing couldn’t be used to dismiss what we would call natural intelligence. Because almost by definition, somebody who’s working on trying to understand the human mind scientifically thinks that there’s ultimately some model there. So it’s like the dismissal on the grounds that the thing isn’t human and therefore not thinking, invalidates the whole field that we’re in, and like, what was the point?\n**LEVIN:** If you look back to when [Alan] Turing began to think about mechanizing thought, which led him to algorithms and the idea of a universal machine that is a computer, that used to be, human beings were called computers. He also reflected back and said, well, you know, we are machines too. Our thought is mechanized. I mean, were born out of laws of physics. Do you feel that it’s feeding back into your understanding of human intelligence. You’re talking about it in a way where you’ve already said things that are very provocative along those lines, but is it making you think, well, we are kind of computational in the way structure of our minds work too?\n**PAVLICK:** I wouldn’t say feeding back because I think, I thought that originally hence my attraction to the field. Again, I think there’s plenty of people who work in both cognitive science and AI who think you can make a ton of technological progress and never need to go as far as saying it’s possible to build actual intelligence. But many do. Many, whether they admit it or not, are drawn for a more romantic notion of what it is possible to do in AI, which is that you think humans ultimately are computational things and that there’s nothing outside, something metaphysical to humans that couldn’t be replicated in a computer.\nThere’s actually a lot of interesting debates on this about what kinds of properties might be inherent to a digital computer versus something else. There’s a lot of room for talking about whether the digital computer itself is the right medium for replicating human intelligence. I’m open to the possibility that that’s the difference, but I don’t have any particular data to point to that convinces me that’s the case.\nAnd so yeah, I would say that I do have a fundamental belief that things are computational, right? Again, it’s based on nothing, right? This is a personality trait.\nBut if you do believe it ultimately is, then I think you actually have a pretty hard argument to make for why being a computer precludes you from thinking, right. For why, you can say it’s not thinking because it’s just compiling or something. I think that’s actually a pretty hard philosophical argument that I haven’t heard made particularly well. People are kind of holding out something special which is the human part of what we mean when we say something like understanding.\n[_Music plays_]\n**STROGATZ:** I love it. Deep question there.\n**LEVIN:** It’s almost like the soul-free will questions, right? What is it that’s intrinsic about us? And is it the mind now? Now it’s the mind?\n**STROGATZ:** Right. It used to be that living things had some vital essence that made them different from non-living things. But when we came to believe in atoms, and that we’re all atoms in various states of organization, it was hard to see where the soul or the vital essence fits in there. So now what we’ve retreated to saying, well, at that level, yes, we’re all atoms, but intelligence—that’s something else. Only we get to be intelligent. The machines are just doing math.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah, it sounds like you don’t buy it.\n**STROGATZ:** I don’t, but I was interested in the comment that Ellie makes that maybe there’s a way out by talking about digital versus, I don’t know what, analog? That somehow that’s where we get to keep the special ownership of intelligence, because we’re analog? The way our neurons work is not exactly digital, is that…, I mean, she doesn’t seem to believe that, but if I heard her right, makes it sound like some people think that might be the escape hatch.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah, I get the impression she is quite open to these digital machines “thinking” and that we’re starting to understand how to even formulate the question now. We’re being pressed by these advances to formulate the question better. What does it mean to be computational? I don’t think we’re doing something magical. We’re doing it gooey, and maybe sloppier, magically, right? This idea that consciousness is this magic kluge for the fact that we’re not infinitely computational is really interesting to me.\nBut I do think the mind is computational. And so why couldn’t a digital machine achieve something like a mind. I just wonder if we’ll be able to recognize, it if it will need consciousness the way that you and I do?\n**STROGATZ:** Aha. That’s another question right?\n**LEVIN:** Yeah. Will it recognize it far before we do? Will it know, it’s aware? Will it be having conversations? And also even it, even that I’m saying it, we’re gonna have to start thinking differently. It’s not even a single entity, right? There’s multiple computers that can go into a single large language model. By being in the thick of it, I think we’re starting to get more precise in it and also realizing, wow, we haven’t ever really tackled this.\n**STROGATZ:** Beautiful.\n**LEVIN:** Well, there’s a lot more to contemplate. So think about it during the break, and we’ll be right back.\n[_Music plays_]\n**LEVIN:** Welcome back to The Joy of Why. We’ve been speaking with computer scientist Ellie Pavlick about AI, language and the human mind.\n**LEVIN:** Now, when, these language models are first trained on these enormous data sets, do they continue to learn and develop in their relationship, let’s say with the user or as new ideas are fed into the internet? Or are they kind of frozen until there’s a big new training initiative?\n**PAVLICK:** Everything comes down to definitions, right? It kind of depends on what you mean by learn and develop. There’s what we call the weights, which is basically, it solved some really complicated set of equations to be really good at predicting next words. And those equations are stored somewhere in a file, right? And if you want to talk to this particular instance of ChatGPT or this particular instance of Claude, you basically load those equations from that file and that’s who you’re talking to. And so those are called the weights. And often what we think of as updating the weights as being this kind of initial learning.\nAnd there’s lots of different ways to update those weights. There’s update the weights themselves. There’s like basically add a little side file that tells you how to pretend you updated those weights. So that can allow you to spawn different models that feel like different models, but you could argue about whether they’re like clones of the same model or they’re different models.\nThat’s a conceptual question. But, also a lot of the things that are being sold as learning and adapting have to do with storing a side knowledge base that could be specific to you. You have a chat with the model and say I’m planning my daughter’s birthday, and I have a whole discussion about budget and her name and her friend’s names and who I want to invite and where I live and that. And then I come back the next day and it like remembers this stuff. It’s not like everyone who’s using Claude or chat GPT now has access to my daughter’s name and my address. That didn’t get pushed into the main model, but it still feels like it learned or developed because it has information now that didn’t have yesterday, and it’s retained that information.\nSo, there’s different mechanisms for models to learn and adapt. And depending on the particular tool and the endpoint you’re using, it might be any combination of these different things.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah. I’m wondering if chat GPT is going to behave differently after lots of interaction with me than yours will with you, for instance. And as though, you know, I have my dog, and my dog is trained to behave a certain way and react to me in a certain way, it’s sort of wondering if it keeps learning and keeps feeding back in that way.\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. There’s lots of ways to customize a model to you and maybe a useful differentiating factor is like how easy it is to reset the model so that we have the same model. In some of these versions, if there’s like this add-on file that contains some information about you, that this model is reading from maybe some small things that adapt weights, you could basically delete that file and get straight back to the exact same base model that I have.\nThere’s another version in which, like, if I take ChatGPT yesterday and I train it on today’s news and it updates the weights, it would actually be really hard for me to, like, get back to yesterday’s version. I don’t know which weights to go and reset. I would have to, like, go retrain the whole thing exactly as it was up until I retrained it today in order to get back. And even then, it might be hard.\nAnd both types of things are learning. Both things have made a change and allowed the model to develop and adapt and stuff. But like some of them we can easily undo and others you can’t. So, they’re qualitatively very different types of learning that probably have different consequences and different interpretations.\n**LEVIN:** It is fascinating in the human analogy where I can teach a group of students a subject, even a very mathematical subject that we consider concrete and objective, and we don’t really understand how they learn it. Why some understand it more deeply and can take it further than what you taught them. And it’s just fascinating that this is happening in parallel in a machine.\n**PAVLICK:** Absolutely, like I think an area that I haven’t really collaborated with yet, but would like to is the cognitive science of education because there’s so much interesting about like how do humans learn and how do we teach them and what’s going on there and how do people misunderstand things. And I think there’s like a lot to be shared in like when we’re thinking about the black box of a LLM and the black box of a human from like, education sciences.\n**LEVIN:** Fascinating. So you use large language models as well as study them. What’s your relationship like with these large language models?\n**PAVLICK:** I mostly use them when I study them. I’ve tried to use them for a few things. I would be embarrassed to be on the record, but I’ve already admitted, I recently got tenure and as a consequence became involved in administration.\n**LEVIN:** Oh, yes. No good deed goes unpunished.\n**PAVLICK:** Exactly. And so as soon as I got involved in administration instead of research, I was like, oh, I start to see the use for large language models. So I tried to do it, to do things like generate the minutes of a faculty meeting, help me sort through some data I was trying to process. And actually, they weren’t good enough, like for even these very basic tasks.\nBut beyond that, I haven’t actually used them for many things in my day-to-day life. And I don’t know if it’s because a few experiences weren’t quite good enough, or because I’m like jaded and cynical about them despite everything I just said.\n**LEVIN:** Let’s say there was never another update. This is it. These are the models that we’re all gonna be using. So, we trained them on all of our examples. For instance, translating English to French to Swahili in back again, and now it’s training us. Where does that put us in this chain? And will we cease to expand? Language modernizes all the time. We speak differently than we did a hundred years ago? Are we gonna kind of freeze in time because we’re in a loop with something? Now, all our students are learning to write and speak from the ChatGPTs or the Claudes as opposed to the other way around.\n**PAVLICK:** The classic academic answer is, like, nothing is that new. I actually remember a talk. I saw like early in grad school about how basically Google had trained people to use keyword searches. And this was an example of humans adapting their language to technology. Early information retrieval would just delete out all of your words.\nIf you said, “Who was Thomas Jefferson’s wife?”, it would just say “Thomas Jefferson wife”, right? And just scramble it. Alphabetize it, right? Like that’s what got you the best result out of the system at the time.\nNow they actually wanted the full language back and they were really struggling to get people to write full questions. And so, there’s already, this example of people talking to a computer and adapting their language to get the best results out of that computer.\nAnd so, I think you will see this. People are getting good at prompting language models and talking to language models in this way. I haven’t yet seen it carry over into how people talk to each other, but technology definitely does influence how people talk to each other. Like, my Gen Z students say punctuation when they’re talking. They’ll say something like, “Do you think this is a good idea, question mark?” Like, they’ll say that. And I’m like, I think this is like a spillover from, like, texting.\nIt almost makes me optimistic. Language has always been very dynamic and very responsive to the technology and the context. And still, I think as long as we continue talking to humans as humans, I think it’s really cool and like cute when you see things like people saying the word “question mark” and “dot dot dot” out loud. It’s like a sign of how plastic and dynamic and interesting language is.\nI would worry about the kind of collapse of linguistic diversity and innovation if people start talking to language models almost exclusively. I don’t know, I guess I’m an optimist. I imagine that people do like to talk to people. Even speaking as an introvert who doesn’t particularly love talking to people, like, I think that people will continue to have human interactions and that will save language.\n**LEVIN:** I appreciated when you pushed back at this idea that when computers are just doing math, that was different than when computers create poems or novels or artwork or songs. What do you think this means for human creativity? This is of course, a question that people are semi-panicked about.\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah. So, I’ve been teaching this class this semester with a professor at Brown named John Kaley, who’s a literary artist, does poetry and other language arts projects, and has always used technology in the course of doing that.\nAnd I think it’s exactly this question about are humans mathematical objects. Like even if you agree or grant that some neurons firing in your brain in a particular way caused you to write this poem, it doesn’t devalue the poem in a particular way. Like I don’t think you have to assert divine intervention was involved in the creation of the poem to believe that the poem itself has aesthetic and artistic value.\nLike, I don’t think we have to reduce it to the thing that created it in a human. And even if I understood the brain activations, it doesn’t mean there’s not value in analyzing this poetry.\nAnd I think the same argument could apply to language models. There is a way of thinking about what they create on its face without caring about what math and whether it was math that caused it.\nAnd there’s probably room for criticism. Depending on what you’re going for, depending on what you care, depending on who you’re talking to in the context, there’s a sense in which you can say, this came from a language model and therefore it’s not interesting… it’s meaningless and everything in between. but I don’t think like humans being mathematical devalues our creativity in any particular way.\n**LEVIN:** Hmmm. It reminds me of the sort of infinite loops of the free will and soul arguments that were unresolvable and are still debated and might be forever. But here we are, and we care if people intentionally do harmful things or not, or intentionally make beautiful things. That’s just how we are. That’s the human condition.\n**PAVLICK:** Exactly. Again, everyone kind of relates to these situations differently. But like, if I’m thinking about a time, I was like particularly connected to a piece of literature, piece of art. I don’t think I spent a ton of time thinking about how causal the person was in it. Right? Sometimes you care about the person’s story. But I’m rarely like hung up on whether this was preordained by the universe. Like that’s not interfering with my ability to appreciate it.\n**LEVIN:** You can be a physical determinist and still right, enjoy the Tate Modern. So, I wonder if even though you were thinking about these things and deep in this subject, if the revelation of the functional LLMs that came out practically as tools, if you were surprised by them? And also do you feel in a position to predict what the future’s gonna be like, how rapid is this change gonna be?\n**PAVLICK:** Hmm, I don’t think I’ve been like super-surprised by the technology, but I think I’ve been a little surprised by the pace of the rollout. I wouldn’t even say surprised because I think it’s economically driven. not technologically driven, right? It’s not like the technology is moving faster than I realized, or at least not now, maybe.\nMy early surprise moments were back in like 2018, 2019, with what would say were the precursors to the large language models. There’s one called ELMO, one called BERT. There was a little cute period where we had a Sesame Street theme going, unfortunately died after a stretch of a few models. It was like very exciting time where it felt like research was turning a corner, and I think a lot of people in academia would point back to that time as being like, “Oh, we’re at a pivoting moment in NLP.”\nAnd then there was like the chat GPT moment, which is where it was like suddenly pulling back the curtain and like now everyone’s involved. And so that was a really important time that I think surprised me in that pace at which then the world was paying attention and the reaction and then the deployment.\nIt does surprise me how quickly people are pushing things out and how willing people are. I’m generally an optimist, but it does scare me a little bit. I think we’re gonna have a few, like, ‘oh crap’ moments that could have been avoided, right?\n**LEVIN:** What would you imagine would be moment like that?\n**PAVLICK:** I could imagine some kind of big security things, some kind of either intentional or unintentional glitch or attack where a lot of systems are implicated. AI, it seems like it’s lots of different technologies, but they’re actually all the same technology, which makes you think they’re deeply correlated errors or vulnerabilities. There’s like a small amount of open-source software that many things are based on. And I mean, it could be overblown because a lot of things are based on the Linux kernel, and that’s quite safe.\n**LEVIN:** The Linux kernel being pre-Unix, which a lot of our Apples run on this kind of operating system.\n**PAVLICK:** Exactly. It’s like kind of core operating system code that is then repurposed and reused.\n**LEVIN:** But Linux was free, right. And it was open source, and it was part of that utopian idealistic movement.\n**PAVLICK:** And obviously could still have bugs in it, and things, but was like understood at a level that is different from large language models. I think there’s also the obvious one that people talk about, which is just the proliferation of scams and this lack of trust. Because if you don’t know that language is coming from a human anymore, you can just fundamentally start doubting everything. Like, I’ve already felt myself do this every time I see a news story or an image. If I didn’t see it on kind of mainstream media, then I just preface everything with I haven’t fact checked it myself. So, I think there are a lot of these things that it’s surprised me how willing people are to try things out so far.\n**LEVIN:** We go right back to it. Human beings, man, we try to be suspicious and we just kind of can’t help ourselves.\n**PAVLICK:** Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.\n**LEVIN:** So there’s a question I always like to ask of our guests, what about your work brings you joy?\n**PAVLICK:** I’m glad we turned that, because now we just talked about the pessimistic thing, but I think I ultimately am extremely optimistic, right? Like, I think the potential value of the systems far outweighs the costs. A lot of people come into AI more as dreamers than anything else. It is just very exciting. It’s fascinating. Like, there’s nothing more fascinating than the human mind and brain. Of course we’re obsessed with this thing. We’re like a narcissistic species. It’s like, we’re so great. We’re so incredible. Like, how do we work? Then the concept that we would stumble upon something computational that replicates parts of that. Being able to study these things and ask questions that seem like they don’t have answers, but then take them seriously as though they do have answers. I feel like it feels like a big privilege.\n**LEVIN:** Treating these philosophical questions is rigorous, scientific, concrete questions that you can actually make progress on.\n**PAVLICK:** A lot of people get a few late nights in college to like think about these things, you like stay up late with your roommate, like having this, and then you go and have a real job where you don’t get to think about it again. Yeah, that’s my whole real job. And that’s wonderful.\n**LEVIN:** Ellie, thanks so much for joining us. It’s been a real pleasure.\n**PAVLICK:** Oh, it’s a pleasure.\n[_Music plays_]\n**STROGATZ:** What a charming take on this, that she gets to think about what she wanted to think about as a college student. I think a lot of scientists feel this way, that it’s a privilege to be able to really spend our time doing what we want to do. Our hobby is our job.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah, and hers seems to me particularly elusive in the science space. It’s getting so philosophical, right. That how do you make progress in the same way that you do in science? I mean, philosophy can really spin your wheels for a very long time.\n**STROGATZ:** Yeah, that makes me wonder, does philosophy always turn into science, just a matter of time? It used to be a question, how is life different from non-life? But after Watson and Crick it started to really look like it’s gonna boil down to molecules and atoms.\n**LEVIN:** And Bertrand Russell, of course, famous British philosopher, also turned to science in many ways. I mean, he was trying to write a kind of mathematical principia, right? Logic, science were involved with things that we’re setting up what Turing, did, what Cantor did, what Godel did. I don’t know. It’s an interesting question. You can send all your mail to Steve…\n**STROGATZ:** But, seriously let’s just ask what are gonna be the longest holdouts? For instance, most people would say values are not something that can be quantified. But I’m not even sure about that because with morality being studied nowadays through evolution of cooperation, from a biological perspective. I’m not even sure that values are outside of science. I guess I’m espousing what the critics call scientism.\n**LEVIN:** Mmmm… uh-oh…\n**STROGATZ:** That it’s all science at the bottom. And that’s a big naughty thing to do, isn’t it? Huh? Okay, just, just thinking out loud here.\n**LEVIN:** I feel like you’re lost in thought. And I need to give you some space to ponder and process. Always great talking to you.\n[_Music plays_]\n**STROGATZ:** Can’t wait to see you again. This is fun.\n**LEVIN:** Yeah. See you next time.\n**LEVIN:** Still have questions about AI’s impact?

CZ resigned as CEO and served four months in U.S. custody as part of the plea deal reached with the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, and the CFTC.\nThe senators warned that Binance’s use of a Trump-affiliated stablecoin “raises even more urgent questions” about the exchange’s compliance. They also [cited reports](https://crypto.news/strategy-coinbase-binance-toncoin-weekly-recap/) that Zhao had lobbied for a potential presidential pardon and that the Trump family discussed acquiring a stake in Binance.US.\nLawmakers are requesting updates by May 21 on Binance’s adherence to its plea agreement, its timeline for leaving the U.S., and any communication with federal agencies regarding USD1 or pardons. \nThe letter comes as Senate Democrats [recently blocked](https://crypto.news/us-senate-votes-against-genius-act-after-democrat-pushback/) a stablecoin bill, citing the lack of provisions to bar Trump and other senior officials from profiting from crypto ventures while in office.

Pepe and other Ethereum meme coins tend to perform well when Ether is in an uptrend.\nIt also coincided with a broad rally in crypto and stock markets ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland. The hope is that the world’s two biggest economies will de-escalate tensions and possibly reduce tariffs.\nYou might also like:  [ Pepe price prediction for May 2025 – the biggest run about to begin for PEPE? ](https://crypto.news/pepe-price-prediction-for-may-2025/)\nPepe’s price also climbed as smart money investors bought the dip. Nansen data shows that there are now 16 smart money investors, up from 12 earlier this month. These investors have increased their holdings to 3.20 trillion PEPE, up from 2.76 trillion earlier this week.\nPepe’s surge also happened as the daily volume in decentralized and centralized exchanges jumped to over $4.7 billion, higher than Dogecoin’s ([DOGE](https://crypto.news/price/dogecoin/)) $3.14 billion and Shiba Inu’s ([SHIB](https://crypto.news/price/shiba-inu/)) $702 million. \nAdditional data shows that futures open interest rose to over $530 million, the highest level since January 17 and well above the year-to-date low of $137 million. A rising open interest is a bullish sign, indicating growing demand. Pepe’s funding rate in the futures market has remained positive in recent weeks.\n## Pepe price technical analysis\nThe daily chart shows that Pepe found a strong bottom around the $0.000060 level throughout 2024. It has failed to break below this price at least three times, forming a triple-bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.00002835, its all-time high. A triple bottom is a popular bullish reversal pattern.\nPepe has also formed a mini golden cross pattern, with the 50-day and 100-day Weighted Moving Averages crossing each other.\nTherefore, the most likely price action is a short-term drop to retest support at $0.0000097, as retail investors take profits. It may then rebound and target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.000017. A breakout above that level could open the door for more gains, potentially retesting its all-time high at $0.00002835.\nYou might also like:  [ How high can Pepe price jump after flipping key resistance? ](https://crypto.news/how-high-can-pepe-price-jump-after-flipping-key-resistance/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

Now, with momentum building and a massive resistance level in sight, traders are watching closely for what comes next.\nMoondeng’s ([MOODENG](https://crypto.news/price/moo-deng/)) explosive rise began after it found solid footing at $0.03, aligning with key technical indicators. As momentum increases, the next test lies at the $0.20 resistance, where bulls will need significant strength to break through.\nMoondeng has caught the attention of traders and speculators alike after a remarkable 200% price rally. The move began from a clean bounce at $0.03, a level supported by strong technical confluence, including a long-term point of control and the value area low. \nNow, with the price heading toward a technically dense resistance zone, the market is preparing for potential consolidation or a breakout that could carry prices even higher.\n## Key technical points\n  * **Strong Support at $0.03:** Confluence of value area low and long-term POC created a strong base for the bullish reversal.\n  * **Next Resistance at $0.20:** Aligned with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, bearish order block, and VWAP from all-time high.\n  * **Momentum Still Rising:** Volume profile indicates a climatic breakout, but a healthy consolidation may be imminent.\n\n\n## Technical analysis and market behavior\nThe initial bounce from $0.03 was no coincidence, this level coincided with the point of control pulled from Moondeng’s all-time high, as well as the value area low. These overlapping indicators created a high-probability zone for demand to step in, and it did, leading to the rapid 200% spike.\nCurrently, Moondeng trades in a zone of heightened attention. The $0.20 region represents a major resistance, combining several technical tools: the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the all-time high, a key bearish order block, and VWAP resistance from the same high. This cluster of resistance is not only a technical challenge for bulls but also a make-or-break area that could dictate the medium-term trend.\nYou might also like:  [ Bitcoin and Ethereum on alert as $3b worth of options expire on Friday ](https://crypto.news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-on-alert-as-3b-worth-of-options-expire-on-friday/)\nDespite the strength of the move, traders should watch for potential consolidation. The volume profile shows a climatic spike, a signal that often precedes sideways action. A higher low forming during this phase would be constructive, preserving the bullish market structure and setting the stage for a breakout above $0.20.\n### What to expect in the coming price action\nIf Moondeng manages to hold its recent gains and establish a higher low, the bullish trend could continue toward the $0.20 resistance, and beyond. A successful breakout from this level would likely open the door to $0.31, marking the next major technical target. Traders should monitor consolidation zones and volume shifts closely, as these will guide the next significant move.\nRead more:  [ Coinbase to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading in U.S. ](https://crypto.news/coinbase-to-launch-24-7-bitcoin-and-ethereum-futures-trading-in-u-s/)\nSign up for crypto news and market insights \nGet crypto market analysis and curated news delivered right to your inbox every week. \nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list. \n  * [News](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [All](https://crypto.news/)\n    * [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/bitcoin/)\n    * [Blockchain](https://crypto.news/tag/blockchain/)\n    * [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/tag/ethereum/)\n    * [DeFi](https://crypto.news/tag/defi/)\n    * [Altcoin](https://crypto.news/tag/altcoin/)\n    * [Regulation](https://crypto.news/tag/regulation/)\n    * [Solana](https://crypto.news/tag/solana/)\n    * [Shiba Inu](https://crypto.news/tag/shiba-inu/)\n  * [Feature](https://crypto.news/feature/)\n  * [Opinion](https://crypto.news/opinion/)\n  * [Follow-up](https://crypto.news/follow-up/)\n  * [Markets](https://crypto.news/markets/)\n  * [Prices](https://crypto.news/market-cap/)\n  * [Learn](https://crypto.news/learn/)\n  * [Free Bitcoins](https://crypto.news/free-bitcoins/)\n  * [Buy Crypto](https://crypto.news/buy-crypto/)\n  * [Events](https://crypto.news/events/)\n  * [Meme Coins](https://crypto.news/meme-coins/)\n  * [Tap-to-earn](https://crypto.news/tap-to-earn-games/)\n  * [Newsletters](https://crypto.news/newsletters/)\n\n\n[ Advertise ](https://crypto.news/advertise/)\nInfo\nTerms\n[ ](https://t.me/cryptodotnews) [ ](https://youtube.com/@cryptodotnews)\nOur site uses cookies and similar technologies.

On Friday, May 9, major U.S. stock indices were down across the board. The Dow Jones lost nearly 200 points or 0.48%, the S&P 500 fell 0.24%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq declined 0.19%.\nYou might also like:  [ Dow inches higher while S&P 500, Nasdaq climb as U.S.-China trade talks loom ](https://crypto.news/dow-inches-higher-while-sp-500-nasdaq-climb-as-u-s-china-trade-talks-loom/)\nThe markets are eagerly awaiting developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China. U.S. President Donald Trump signaled that he was prepared to lower tariffs on all Chinese goods to 80%. He added that the decision would ultimately be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nWhile this rate remains prohibitively high for many exporters, it is lower than the previous 145% imposed earlier. More importantly, Trump’s rhetoric suggests a tone of de-escalation ahead of the crucial trade negotiations with China. The talks could help reduce reciprocal tariffs between the two countries, as China had retaliated with its own 125% tariff on U.S. goods.\n## Strategy, Palantir, among the biggest losers, gold gains\nAmong tech stocks, Palantir was among the worst performers, down 2.23% today. The stock is set to close the week down 5% as investors reassess its high valuation. Notably, on Tuesday, its shares dropped 12%, losing 35 million in market cap due to a [drop in quarterly earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-stock-slides-after-earnings-spotlight-international-weakness-irrational-valuation-125321531.html). \nYou might also like:  [ Strategy grows Bitcoin war chest, Nexo returns to US, former Celsius CEO faces 20 years | Weekly Recap ](https://crypto.news/strategy-bitcoin-war-chest-nexo-celsius-weekly-recap/)\nInterestingly, shares of Strategy, a leveraged Bitcoin investment firm, were also down 1.78% since market open. This is despite Bitcoin [(BTC)](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/) posting a 1.23% increase over the last 24 hours and a 5% increase over seven days. \nOn the other hand, bearish sentiment in the stock market prompted many traders to increase their gold exposure.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "# UMG Seeks Dismissal of Drake's Lawsuit Over Kendrick Lamar's Diss Track\n## Legal Drama Intensifies Between Drake and His Own Label\nThe heated rap feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has now reached courtrooms, with Universal Music Group (UMG)--Drake's own record label--seeking once again to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the rapper. The conflict revolves around Lamar's explosive diss track _Not Like Us_ , which Drake alleges was promoted by UMG despite containing damaging lyrics.\n## The Backstory: Drake's Accusations\nDrake first filed a lawsuit in January 2025, accusing UMG of launching a \"smear campaign\" against him by actively supporting and promoting Lamar's track. The rapper claimed that the song included defamatory lyrics aimed at damaging his reputation, specifically referencing a now-notorious line that labeled Drake and his associates as \"certified pedophiles.\"\nDrake's legal team argued that UMG's involvement in promoting the track, coupled with its exposure at high-profile events like the Super Bowl and 2025 Grammy Awards, contributed to public belief in the defamatory claims.\n## UMG's Initial Response\nUMG quickly countered with a motion to dismiss in March, calling Drake's accusations baseless and misleading. They emphasized that their role as a music distributor does not equate to endorsement or responsibility for an artist's lyrics.\n## Drake Doubles Down With Amended Complaint\nIn April, Drake's legal team refiled an amended complaint, doubling down on his claims. The updated filing introduced new elements:\n  * The inclusion of _Not Like Us_ in Kendrick Lamar's widely-watched Super Bowl halftime show.\n  * Its prominent presence at the Grammy Awards, where it received widespread media coverage.\n  * Allegations that UMG promoted the track despite knowing its controversial nature.\n\n\nDrake also attempted to support his claim by referencing online reactions from social media users, podcasters, and commentators who interpreted Lamar's lyrics as factual.\n## UMG's New Motion: \"Cherry-Picked Conspiracies\"\nUMG filed a new motion on May 7, repeating their argument that the case lacks legal merit. They claimed that Drake's team had removed earlier \"obviously false\" allegations--like claims that UMG used bots to inflate streams--and replaced them with equally weak ones.\nIn their court filing, UMG attorneys highlighted that:\n  * Lamar's Super Bowl performance did not include the most controversial lyric.\n  * The lyric in question was artistic hyperbole, not a factual statement.\n  * Drake's reliance on anonymous online comments does not meet legal standards for defamation.\n\n\n## UMG Blasts Drake's Legal Strategy\nIn a statement to _Variety_ , a UMG spokesperson slammed Drake's approach: \"Nowhere in the hundred-plus page 'legal' blather written by Drake's lawyers do they bother to acknowledge that Drake himself has written and performed massively successful songs containing equally provocative taunts against other artists. Nor do they mention that it was Drake who started this particular exchange.\"\nThe label insists that Drake's lawsuit is a distraction, built on \"wild conspiracies\" and unverified claims from social media. They also emphasized their ongoing business partnership with the rapper, pointing to his continued success under the UMG banner.\n## What's Next\nThe court will now evaluate UMG's motion to dismiss and determine whether Drake's amended complaint has enough legal standing to proceed. If the judge agrees with UMG, the lawsuit could be thrown out altogether. If not, the case could head to trial--adding a legal layer to one of the most watched rap feuds in years.\nFor now, the legal saga continues as fans, critics, and industry insiders wait to see how this dramatic chapter between two of hip-hop's biggest names--and one powerful record label--unfolds.",

    "content": "# Tish Cyrus Shuts Down Rumors of Feud With Daughter Miley Cyrus\n##  _\" I Would Never Unfollow Miley\" -- Tish Clears the Air on Social Media Mix-Up_\nTish Cyrus, the beloved mom of pop superstar Miley Cyrus, is setting the record straight after fans suspected a falling-out between the mother-daughter duo. The buzz started when eagle-eyed followers noticed that Tish had apparently unfollowed Miley on Instagram -- sparking speculation of a family rift. But now, Tish is clearing the air, and her response proves the bond between them is stronger than ever.\n* * *\n## The Instagram Unfollow That Sparked a Storm\n### Fans Thought Tish and Miley Were on Bad Terms -- But It Was All a Mistake\nOn May 7, Tish Cyrus responded to a curious fan on Instagram who asked why she had unfollowed her daughter Miley. Her reply? Short, sweet, and straightforward:\n> \"Have no idea how that happened, but it's fixed now!\"\nThat single comment immediately calmed some of the storm online, but the rumors had already begun spreading. People speculated whether there had been tension between the Cyrus women, especially following personal family developments like Tish's marriage to actor Dominic Purcell and Billy Ray Cyrus' remarriage to Firerose.\n* * *\n## Tish Doubles Down on Twitter (Now X)\n### \"We're As Close As Ever\" -- Public Statement Ends the Drama\nTo make her stance crystal clear, Tish followed up with a post on X (formerly Twitter) on May 8:\n> \"I would never unfollow Miley. She and I are as close as we've always been. Period. Love you, Little.\"\nThe warm declaration ended any doubt for fans who wondered if something deeper was going on. Tish's words showed just how committed she is to supporting her daughter publicly and privately.\n* * *\n## Miley and Tish: A Stronger Bond Than Ever\n### From the Grammys to Personal Tributes, Miley's Love for Her Mom Shines\nFar from being distant, Miley and Tish's relationship appears to be thriving. Tish has been Miley's plus-one at major events, including the 2025 Grammy Awards where Miley took home her first Grammy for her smash hit _Flowers_. The pair posed for photos and looked closer than ever.\nIn a heartfelt 2024 interview with David Letterman on _My Next Guest Needs No Introduction_ , Miley shared how much her mother means to her.\n> \"Honestly, my mom is my hero,\" she said, reflecting on how different her bond is with Tish compared to her relationship with her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus.\nThis wasn't the first time Miley honored her mom. Back in 2019, she released the song _Mother 's Daughter_ as a tribute to Tish. Not only did she dedicate the lyrics to her mother, but Tish even starred in the official music video.\n* * *\n## The Ultimate Momager: Tish's Role in Miley's Life\n### From Disney Days to Global Fame, Tish Has Always Had Miley's Back\nTish Cyrus isn't just Miley's mom -- she's been a rock-solid manager, fashion guide, and creative partner. Over the years, fans have admired how Tish stood by Miley through her most transformative career phases, including her time at Disney Channel and her boundary-pushing evolution into one of today's biggest music icons.\nMiley has often called her mom the ultimate boss lady. During the promo for _Mother 's Daughter_, Miley wrote on Instagram:\n> \"BOSS LADY. Momager, Producer, Interior Designer, Fashion Icon, Defies Time & Age, most badass mom of all f--king time!\"\n* * *\n## A Close-Knit Family -- Despite Public Scrutiny\n### Tish and Her Five Kids Continue to Stay United\nTish shares five children with ex-husband Billy Ray Cyrus -- Brandi (37), Trace (36), Braison (30), Miley (31), and Noah (25). Despite going through a very public divorce and eventual remarriage, she's managed to maintain close ties with all her children.\nIn recent interviews and social media posts, Tish and her kids frequently express affection for one another, suggesting a tight-knit family that's still very much connected -- even as they lead separate public lives.\nTish is now married to _Prison Break_ star Dominic Purcell, and by all accounts, the blended family dynamic is working well. Miley even attended her mother's wedding in 2023, further showing that any talk of a lasting rift is far from reality.\n* * *\n## Social Media Mishaps: A Modern-Day Family Drama?\n### When Accidental Unfollows Spark Unwanted Gossip\nIn today's hyper-connected world, even a simple unfollow can spark wild conspiracy theories. It's a reminder of how closely celebrity families are watched -- and how quickly fans can jump to conclusions.\nBut thankfully, Tish handled it with class and clarity. Her response not only shut down the feud rumors but reinforced how much she values her bond with Miley.\n* * *\n##  A Loving Mother-Daughter Duo Standing Strong\n### The Cyrus Women Aren't Feuding -- They're Thriving\nAt the end of the day, the so-called feud between Tish and Miley was nothing more than a social media fluke. With open communication, public affirmations, and shared love for each other, the Cyrus women have shown once again that their family bond runs deep.\nFrom heartfelt tributes to real-life support, their relationship is an inspiring reminder that even in the spotlight, family love can weather any rumor.",

The film stars Dakota Johnson as a matchmaker who suddenly finds her own heart caught in a tangled web between Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal.\nDirected and written by Celine Song, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind _Past Lives_ , this romantic drama explores the chaos that unfolds when someone who helps others find love ends up lost in it herself.\n* * *\n## What Is Materialists About?\n### A Matchmaker's Perfect Business Collides With Her Messy Love Life\nAccording to the official synopsis, _Materialists_ follows Lucy, a successful matchmaker who has built a thriving business helping others find love. But her carefully crafted world is turned upside down when she becomes involved in a toxic love triangle that threatens her career and emotional stability.\n> _\" A matchmaker's lucrative business is complicated when she falls into a toxic love triangle that threatens her clients.\"_\nLucy finds herself torn between:\n  * John (played by Chris Evans): her flawed ex-boyfriend, who brings out the worst and best in her.\n  * Henry Castillo (played by Pedro Pascal): the seemingly perfect man who makes her feel loved and seen.\n\n\nCaught between old habits and new possibilities, Lucy must choose between her past and her future.\n* * *\n## Watch the Trailer: Romance, Drama, and Heartbreak Collide\nThe trailer begins with a fast-paced look at Lucy's world - dinner dates, flirty consultations, and sharp-tongued advice. She's confident, composed, and coldly efficient when it comes to others' emotions. But when it comes to her own, things start to unravel.\n> \"No one plays the game better than Lucy, but love isn't part of her equation,\" the voiceover warns.\nSoon, Lucy is seen clashing with John in the middle of the street -- an intense moment showing their emotional baggage. Moments later, she shares a magical meet-cute with Henry at a client's party, and the chemistry between them is immediate.\nAs the romance with Henry deepens, Lucy opens up:\n> \"You make me feel valuable,\" she tells him -- a rare moment of vulnerability for the fiercely independent matchmaker.\nBut no matter how perfect Henry seems, something keeps pulling Lucy back toward John -- leading to a love triangle that's as passionate as it is painful.\n* * *\n## Meet the Stars of Materialists\nThis A-list trio promises to deliver strong performances:\n  * Dakota Johnson (_Persuasion_ , _Fifty Shades of Grey_) plays Lucy, the complicated matchmaker.\n  * Chris Evans (_Knives Out_ , _Avengers: Endgame_) stars as John, the emotionally messy ex.\n  * Pedro Pascal (_The Last of Us_ , _The Mandalorian_) plays Henry, the dream man with charm and depth.\n\n\nWith three powerhouse performers at the center, _Materialists_ promises rich character drama and on-screen chemistry that sizzles.\n* * *\n## Director Celine Song Returns After Past Lives Success\n _Materialists_ is directed by Celine Song, whose 2023 romantic drama _Past Lives_ was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards, earning her a spot among today's top cinematic storytellers.\nSong is known for her thoughtful explorations of love, longing, and identity -- and _Materialists_ looks set to continue that legacy, but with a more modern and messier twist.\nShe also wrote the script, ensuring that her distinct storytelling voice remains central to the film.\n* * *\n## Behind the Scenes: Producers and Studio\nThe film is produced by:\n  * Christine Vachon and Pam Koffler of Killer Films\n  * David Hinojosa from 2AM\n\n\nA24, the studio behind award-winning films like _Everything Everywhere All At Once_ and _Lady Bird_ , is backing the project. Known for stylish and bold indie films, A24's involvement suggests _Materialists_ will be equal parts artistic and emotional.\n* * *\n## When Does Materialists Come Out?\n_Materialists_ is set to be released in theaters on June 13, 2025.\nThis summer release positions it as a perfect date night drama -- and potentially an early Oscar contender depending on reception. No streaming release has been confirmed yet, but A24 titles typically hit platforms like Max or Apple TV after their theatrical runs.\n* * *\n## Why This Love Triangle Feels So Real\nWhat makes _Materialists_ different from other romantic dramas is its grounded, modern take on love. Lucy isn't just caught between two men -- she's torn between two versions of herself:\n  * The safe, polished professional who helps others with love.\n  * The messy, emotional human who struggles to find it for herself.\n\n\nThis duality adds emotional weight to every romantic interaction, making the story relatable for anyone who's ever had to choose between \"what looks right\" and \"what feels right.\"\n* * *\n## A Must-Watch Romance With a Sharp Edge\nWith its emotional depth, modern sensibility, and a stellar cast, _Materialists_ is shaping up to be one of the most compelling romantic films of 2025. Whether you're here for the sizzling chemistry, the emotional stakes, or Celine Song's storytelling, this film is one to watch.\nIf you've ever been caught between the past and the future, this messy, beautiful love triangle will hit home -- and leave you thinking long after the credits roll.",

However, given the massive success of the overall universe, future spin-offs or prequels -- especially involving The Nun or Annabelle -- are always possible.\nBut for Ed and Lorraine, this is their last mission together.\n* * *\n_The Conjuring: Last Rites_ promises to be a thrilling, emotional, and frightening farewell to two of horror's most beloved characters.

    "content": "## Blake Lively to Testify in Trial Against Justin Baldoni\n### Actress Will Speak Out in Court Over Sexual Harassment Allegations\nHollywood star Blake Lively is preparing to take the stand in a highly publicized trial against her _It Ends With Us_ co-star Justin Baldoni. Her lawyer has confirmed she will testify during the proceedings, which are set to begin in March 2026. The case, which started with Lively's sexual harassment lawsuit, has evolved into a major legal drama filled with accusations, counterclaims, and public attention.\n* * *\n## What Started the Legal Battle\nIn December 2024, Blake Lively filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Baldoni, alleging misconduct that occurred on the set of their romantic drama _It Ends With Us_ (IEWU).\nNot long after, Justin Baldoni--best known for _Jane the Virgin_ --hit back with a defamation and extortion countersuit, claiming Lively's allegations were false and damaging to his reputation.\nSince then, the case has become a media spectacle, with the court labeling it a war of public relations strategies as much as a legal issue.\n* * *\n## Lively Will Testify:Ultimate Moment for Her Story\nBlake Lively's attorney, Mike Gottlieb, confirmed to _PEOPLE_ that she will absolutely testify in court.\n> \"We expect her to be a witness at her trial. Of course, she's going to testify,\" Gottlieb said. \"It's the ultimate moment for a plaintiff's story to be told.\"\nThe confirmation comes after months of speculation, especially following Lively's emotional speech at the TIME100 Gala in April 2025.\n* * *\n## A Personal Story Hinted at Something Deeper\nDuring her TIME100 speech, Lively spoke about her mother's harrowing past--a story of survival after being attacked by a workplace acquaintance. The actress added that her mother survived a murder attempt before she was born.\nMany fans believed that Lively was drawing a parallel between her mother's story and her own experience. She said, \"I have so much to say about the last two years of my life,\" hinting that the events on the IEWU set had a lasting impact.\n* * *\n## Not Just Lively: Others to Testify Too\nLively won't be the only one speaking out.\nHer legal team says that other witnesses--including individuals who allegedly saw or experienced misconduct during filming--will also testify live in court.\n> \"We expect their testimony, particularly about what took place on set, will come out through live witness testimony,\" said attorney Gottlieb.\n* * *\n## What Evidence Will Be Presented\nLively's team isn't only relying on words. According to Gottlieb, they will also bring documents, statements, and supporting evidence to court. This includes:\n  * Testimonies from producers\n  * Internal communications from Sony Pictures\n  * Written statements from eyewitnesses\n\n\nThis multi-pronged approach shows that Lively's team plans to build a strong and detailed case in front of the judge and jury.\n* * *\n## What Justin Baldoni Says\nBaldoni's legal response has been firm. His countersuit claims that the allegations are completely false and part of an attempt to extort him. His legal team has denied all accusations and stated that Baldoni looks forward to clearing his name.\nAs of now, Baldoni has not publicly commented in detail about Lively's planned testimony, but the legal clash is expected to intensify as the trial date approaches.\n* * *\n## Trial Set for March 2026\nThe courtroom showdown is scheduled to begin on March 9, 2026. With two of Hollywood's most recognized actors involved, this trial is expected to gain massive media coverage and could have broader implications for how misconduct on film sets is addressed in the entertainment industry.\n* * *\n## What This Means for Hollywood\nThe case has already reignited discussions about:\n  * Set safety and power dynamics\n  * Workplace harassment in the entertainment industry\n  * The role of studios in protecting (or failing) their stars\n\n\nIf Lively's team delivers strong witness testimony and evidence, it could mark a significant moment in celebrity legal accountability.\n* * *\nThis upcoming trial isn't just a legal battle between two stars--it could change how the entertainment industry handles claims of misconduct. With Blake Lively prepared to testify, the world will be watching closely. And as the countdown to March 2026 begins, more details are likely to emerge, making this case one of the most important--and controversial--in recent Hollywood history.\n* * *",

The beloved Netflix series, which follows the life of Georgia Miller and her teenage daughter Ginny, is about to bring even more drama, twists, and family moments. Season 3 will hit Netflix on June 5, and it promises to be the most explosive season yet!\n**What 's Happening in Season 3**\nWhen we last saw Georgia (played by Brianne Howey), she was being arrested for murder right after her wedding. That left the fate of the Miller family hanging in the balance. With Georgia facing a murder trial, and her children Ginny (Antonia Gentry) and Austin (Diesel La Torraca) stuck in the middle, the tension is higher than ever. Season 3 will explore Georgia's efforts to fight her way out of trouble while dealing with the emotional toll of the situation.\nGeorgia's journey is going to get even more intense in this season, as she's faced with scenarios she's never had to deal with before. In an exclusive interview with Tudum, Howey said, \"Georgia is definitely pushed to her limits this season, and she has to survive scenarios she's never had to survive before.\"\n**What to Expect from Ginny in Season 3**\nFor Ginny, it's going to be a season of self-discovery. In Season 2, we saw Ginny struggle with her identity and her relationship with her mother. But this time, we'll see a more confident Ginny who is ready to make tough decisions. According to Gentry, \"We see a new side of Ginny where she's really coming into her own, accepting her decisions, standing by them, and making hard choices without being riddled with guilt or shame.\"\nIn Season 3, Ginny is no longer just trying to survive the chaos of her life; she's learning to control her own narrative and fight for the people she loves.

The cast and crew have been hard at work bringing this explosive season to life. Antonia Gentry shared her excitement about wrapping the season, stating, \"I just want to see what we've managed to create this season, and see if people love it.\"\nBrianne Howey also reflected on the bittersweet feeling of finishing production: \"It's so close, but there's so much exciting stuff to do! We've worked so hard, and the scripts are amazing. We're just so proud.\"\n**What Happens Next in the Story**\nSeason 2 left us with Georgia's arrest for the murder of Tom, a comatose man she killed to protect his family. This shocking twist set the stage for Season 3, where Georgia will have to deal with the fallout of her actions. _Ginny & Georgia_ has always been about the complicated relationship between mother and daughter, but in Season 3, we'll see how Georgia's past continues to haunt her and what lengths she'll go to in order to protect her family.\nWhile Georgia deals with her trial, Ginny and Austin will have to navigate the pressure of potentially losing their mother to prison.

    "content": "**The Survivors: A Gripping Murder Mystery Coming to Netflix This June**\nNetflix is gearing up to release a brand-new, limited six-episode series, _The Survivors_ , which will surely keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The show combines the intrigue of a murder mystery with deep emotional drama, all set against the stunning yet eerie backdrop of a small Tasmanian town. Premiering on June 6, 2025, _The Survivors_ promises to be a must-watch for anyone who loves gripping drama, unforgettable characters, and breathtaking scenery.\n### The Story Behind _The Survivors_\nSet in the picturesque yet haunting coastal town of Evelyn Bay, _The Survivors_ delves into the lives of Kieran Elliott and Mia Chang, a couple who return to Kieran's hometown to visit his ailing father and distant mother. As they reconnect with family, the couple is forced to confront ghosts from their past, revealing dark secrets and buried truths. When a body is discovered on the beach, the town is thrown into turmoil once more, uncovering long-forgotten mysteries and triggering a murder investigation that could change everything.\n#### What's at Stake for the Characters\n _The Survivors_ is more than just a whodunit. Showrunner Tony Ayres describes it as \"a family melodrama disguised as a murder mystery,\" with the heart of the story focusing on emotional struggles like a son's yearning for his mother's love and a mother's inability to provide it. The show delves into themes of grief, family dynamics, and the stories people tell themselves to move on from tragedy. For Kieran and Mia, and the people of Evelyn Bay, these long-hidden stories are about to unravel in a spectacular and heartbreaking way.\n### The Cast You Can't Miss\nThe talented cast of _The Survivors_ brings these complex emotional themes to life. Leading the charge are:\n  * Charlie Vickers as Kieran Elliott\n  * Yerin Ha as Mia Chang\n  * Robyn Malcolm as Verity Elliott\n  * Damien Garvey as Brian Elliott\n  * Thom Green as Sean Gilroy\n  * Jessica De Gouw as Olivia Birch\n  * Miriama Smith as Detective Senior Sergeant Sue Pendlebury\n  * Johnny Carr as Detective Alex Dan\n\n\nEach actor brings a unique energy to their role, making the characters of _The Survivors_ both relatable and unforgettable. From Kieran's struggle with guilt to Mia's emotional journey, this is a show about people who are forced to face their darkest fears.\n#### The Emotional and Physical Landscape of _The Survivors_\nThe series was filmed in Tasmania, specifically in the region around Eaglehawk Neck, which perfectly captures the gothic and mysterious tone of the show. Ayres points out that, though Evelyn Bay itself is fictional, the landscape of Tasmania, with its dramatic cliffs and stormy seas, provides the perfect backdrop for the intense emotions that play out throughout the series.\nTasmania's striking beauty is matched only by the emotional scale of the series. The vastness of the landscape amplifies the characters' personal struggles, creating a visually and emotionally powerful narrative.\n### Based on the Bestselling Novel by Jane Harper\n _The Survivors_ is adapted from Jane Harper's bestselling novel, which expertly weaves together a murder mystery with complex themes of grief and loss. Ayres, who served as the show's showrunner, praised Harper for her exceptional storytelling and ability to create gripping narratives.

    "content": "Let's be real--life can throw some pretty unpredictable curveballs. Whether it's an unexpected medical bill, a car repair, or a job loss, these emergencies can often lead us straight into the trap of debt. And without a financial cushion, we're left scrambling to find money, turning to high-interest loans or credit cards to cover the costs. One of the main reasons so many people fall into this cycle is simply that they don't have enough money in savings to handle these surprise expenses. According to a recent study from the Federal Reserve, nearly 37% of Americans don't even have $400 saved for an emergency. That's a scary statistic when you think about how easily an emergency can turn into a debt crisis.\nIf you're part of that 37%, it's time to take action. But here's the good news: building savings for both today and tomorrow is within your reach, and you can start making progress right now. While it may seem like a big challenge, breaking it down into small, manageable steps will help you create a solid foundation for your financial future--and avoid the stress of living paycheck to paycheck.\nBefore you dive into the details of how to save, you might feel overwhelmed by the idea of dealing with debt. In cases like this, looking into options like [Freedom Debt Relief reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/freedomDebtReliefUSA/comments/1gkm1l1/ever_wondered_is_freedom_debt_relief_legit/) can give you an understanding of how debt relief programs work and whether they're the right choice for your situation. While these services can be helpful for managing existing debt, building your savings will be the key to preventing future financial problems.\n**The Importance of Starting Small**\nOne of the biggest reasons people struggle to save is that they think they need a huge amount to start. But the truth is, even small amounts add up over time. The key to building savings is starting with what you can afford, and gradually increasing the amount as you get more comfortable with saving. For example, if you can put away just $20 a week, you'll have saved $1,040 in one year. While it might not feel like much at first, it's a step in the right direction.\nIt's important to remember that saving isn't about making huge, dramatic changes to your lifestyle right away--it's about being consistent and intentional. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase your savings rate. Start with a small, achievable goal, like saving $100 or $200 per month, and once you've mastered that, try for more.\n**Setting Up a Dedicated Savings Account**\nWhen it comes to saving money, it's easy to let the funds slip away if you keep them in your main checking account. To build effective savings, set up a dedicated savings account that's separate from the money you use for daily expenses. Having a separate account helps prevent you from dipping into your savings for non-emergencies and makes it easier to track your progress.\nMany banks and credit unions offer high-yield savings accounts, which provide better interest rates than traditional accounts. Though the returns may be modest, over time, the interest will add up, giving you a small but helpful boost to your savings efforts. If you're really serious about your savings goals, consider automating your contributions so that a portion of your income is automatically transferred into your savings account each pay period. This way, you won't have to worry about forgetting to save or spending the money on impulse purchases.\n**Building an Emergency Fund**\nOne of the most important things you can do when building savings is to [establish an emergency fund](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/an-essential-guide-to-building-an-emergency-fund/). This fund is there for unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss, and should be kept separate from other savings goals. Financial experts generally recommend saving at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund.\nBut here's the thing: It's okay to start small with your emergency fund. If you don't have a large amount to put away right now, aim for your first goal of $500 or $1,000. Once you've hit that mark, gradually build it up to cover a few months' worth of expenses. Having this cushion will give you peace of mind, knowing that you're prepared for whatever life throws your way without needing to rely on credit cards or loans.\n**Cutting Expenses to Save More**\nTo really boost your savings, you'll need to take a close look at your expenses and identify areas where you can cut back. The idea isn't to live in deprivation, but rather to find ways to be more intentional with your spending. Start by reviewing your monthly bills--things like subscription services, dining out, and entertainment. Are there any subscriptions you're not using that you can cancel? Can you cut back on eating out and cook more meals at home?\nEven small adjustments can make a big difference over time. For example, packing your lunch instead of eating out or brewing your own coffee instead of buying it at a cafe can save you hundreds of dollars each year. Once you identify areas to trim, put that extra money directly into your savings account. Over time, these little changes can lead to a more significant savings boost.\n**The Power of Investing for the Long Term**\nWhile building an emergency fund and [saving for short-term goals](https://www.fastcompany.com/91324987/3-tips-balance-short-term-long-term-savings-goals) are crucial, it's also important to think about the future. Once you've established some financial security, consider investing your savings for long-term growth. Investment options like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can help your money grow over time, allowing you to build wealth for retirement or other future goals.\nStart by contributing to a retirement account like a 401(k) or an IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages, which can help your savings grow faster. If you're unsure where to start with investing, look into low-cost index funds, which are designed to track the performance of the overall market and provide steady, long-term returns.\nKeep in mind that investing does come with some level of risk, so it's important to do your research or consult with a financial advisor before jumping in. But even a small amount of money invested wisely can grow into a significant nest egg over time.\n**Staying Consistent and Patient**\nThe key to building savings for today and tomorrow is consistency. Whether you're building an emergency fund, cutting expenses, or investing for the future, the most important thing is to stick with it. It might not seem like much at first, but over time, your savings will grow, and you'll feel more secure knowing that you have a financial cushion.\nIt's also important to stay patient. Building savings isn't something that happens overnight, and there will be times when it feels like progress is slow. But as long as you keep putting in the effort, you'll see results. Every small step you take now will pay off in the long run, giving you the freedom to face life's challenges without the stress of debt.\n**The Path to Financial Security**\nBuilding savings for today and tomorrow is not just about putting money away--it's about creating financial security that lets you live with peace of mind. Starting with small, manageable goals, setting up a dedicated savings account, cutting expenses, and investing wisely are all important steps in the process. By staying consistent and patient, you'll not only avoid falling into the trap of debt but also set yourself and your family up for a more financially secure future.\nRemember, the journey to financial security doesn't happen overnight, but the sooner you start, the better off you'll be in the long run. So take control of your finances today--and set yourself up for a brighter tomorrow.",

Let's dive into what Affleck had to say about the paparazzi frenzy and his thoughts on the collective cruelty he believes celebrities face.\n* * *\n## Ben Affleck Reflects on Britney Spears' Paparazzi Struggles\n### The Paparazzi's Role in Spears' Breakdown\nAffleck, who is promoting _The Accountant 2_ , recalled how he was not only aware of Britney's struggles but also felt a deep sense of sympathy for her due to the overwhelming media attention. He explained that he had seen Spears being hounded by paparazzi during her difficult moments, a time that ultimately led to her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.\nThis period in Britney's life was marked by intense media coverage and relentless harassment, which many believe played a role in her mental health struggles. In 2008, Spears was involuntarily placed under a conservatorship, which lasted until 2021, after years of public scrutiny and pressure.\n* * *\n## Ben Affleck's Personal Empathy for Britney\n### A Star's Perspective on the Paparazzi Cycle\nAffleck shared that while he didn't know Britney personally, he couldn't help but empathize with her given his understanding of the toll paparazzi harassment can take on someone. He said:\n> _\" I remember it seemed like... these people are following her around in a time where she may or may not have been having difficulty.\"_\nThe Good Will Hunting actor elaborated on the impact of having cameras constantly following a person, especially when they might already be going through personal struggles. According to Affleck, this constant pressure from the paparazzi seemed to fuel the situation, worsening what was already a difficult time for the singer.\n* * *\n## The Unseen \"Cycle\" of Paparazzi Aggression\n### Affleck Highlights the \"Unintentional Collective Cruelty\" of Fame\nAffleck didn't stop there. He took a deep dive into the larger picture of how the paparazzi system works and how it affects celebrities in general. He described the situation as a \"cycle of harassment\"--a constant barrage of media attention that doesn't allow celebrities to have a moment of peace.\n> _\" I do know that the cycle of having people harangue you and yell at you and hassle you and follow you... It seemed like that itself was kind of whipping up the whole thing into a tizzy,\"_ Affleck said.\nHe reflected on the fact that paparazzi often seem to provoke stars by yelling at them or making them uncomfortable. This, in turn, makes the stars look annoyed or upset, feeding the public's perceptions and continuing the cycle of harassment and misinterpretation. According to Affleck, this isn't just an individual issue--it's a larger, culturally ingrained problem.\n* * *\n## Ben Affleck on Celebrity Life and Public Scrutiny\n### Understanding the Constant Pressure of Fame\nThe actor also spoke about the psychological toll that fame can take on celebrities, particularly those like Britney Spears, who were thrust into the limelight at an early age. He emphasized how the constant harassment and attention from photographers and media outlets can create a toxic environment for celebrities who are just trying to live their lives.\nThis constant invasion of privacy is not only mentally draining but also exacerbates personal struggles, which can lead to misunderstandings, meltdowns, and public controversies--much like what happened with Britney.\n* * *\n## Ben Affleck's Upcoming Project: _The Accountant 2_\n### What's Next for the Star?\nDespite the intense discussion about Britney Spears and paparazzi culture, Ben Affleck continues to focus on his career. The actor is gearing up for the release of his upcoming film, _The Accountant 2_ , where he reprises his role as Christian Wolff, a mathematical genius with a criminal past.\n_The Accountant 2_ promises to bring more high-stakes action, and Affleck's portrayal of Wolff continues to captivate audiences. In addition to Affleck, the film also stars Jon Bernthal and is set to hit theaters soon.\n* * *\n##  The Impact of Paparazzi on Celebrities\n### Ben Affleck's Heartfelt Remarks Shine Light on the Issue\nBen Affleck's comments on his sympathy for Britney Spears shed light on a troubling issue that many stars face today--the relentless scrutiny of the paparazzi. Whether it's harassment, public meltdowns, or personal struggles, the pressure placed on celebrities often seems unbearable. Through his words, Affleck provides a glimpse into the unseen emotional toll of fame and the unintended cruelty that can come with constant media attention.\nBy sharing his thoughts, Affleck not only shows his understanding of Britney's experiences but also highlights the need for more compassion toward public figures who are continuously chased by the spotlight.",

    "content": "## BLACKPINK's Lisa Breaks Silence at Met Gala 2025 with Controversial Louis Vuitton Look\nLouis Vuitton Confirms Portraits on Lisa's Dress Aren't of Rosa Parks After Online Backlash\nBLACKPINK star Lisa made headlines at the 2025 Met Gala with a striking all-black Louis Vuitton outfit--but not just for her bold fashion choice. Social media erupted when users believed her lace ensemble featured a portrait of Rosa Parks, the legendary American civil rights activist. The backlash came quickly. But now, Louis Vuitton has issued an official clarification: the artwork on the dress does not depict Rosa Parks.\nLet's break down what really happened, the real inspiration behind the outfit, and what the luxury brand had to say.\n* * *\n## Lisa's Bold Entrance at the Met Gala 2025\n### An All-Black Look That Matched the Theme\nLisa, known for her daring style and fearless red carpet choices, showed up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday night in an elegant all-black outfit designed by Louis Vuitton. The ensemble was part of the 2025 Gala's theme, _\" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\"_ which celebrated Black fashion, culture, and influence in haute couture.\nThe 28-year-old K-pop icon wore a form-fitting black blazer with sheer side panels. She completed the look with lace underwear featuring printed portraits, a sleek LV purse, and black heels. Her hair was styled in a voluminous updo, and she chose subtle makeup to keep the focus on her outfit.\nBut what was meant to be a fashion-forward tribute quickly turned controversial.\n* * *\n## Social Media Reacts: Was That Rosa Parks on Lisa's Outfit?\n### Backlash Begins Over Alleged Rosa Parks Portrait\nAlmost immediately after Lisa's Met Gala appearance, social media platforms lit up with reactions. Many users claimed they recognized Rosa Parks' face on Lisa's underwear, accusing the outfit of being disrespectful and tone-deaf.\nFans and critics alike questioned whether it was appropriate to place such a significant historical figure on a part of clothing generally considered intimate or provocative.\nSome online posts called it _\" a tasteless use of Black history,\"_ while others speculated whether Louis Vuitton or Lisa herself approved of the portrayal.\n* * *\n## Louis Vuitton Responds: \"It's Not Rosa Parks\"\n### Clarification on the Portraits by Henry Taylor\nFollowing the online uproar, Louis Vuitton issued a formal statement clarifying the artwork's origin. Contrary to online assumptions, the portraits on Lisa's outfit were not of Rosa Parks or any other well-known civil rights icons.\nInstead, the artwork was created by Henry Taylor, an American contemporary artist known for his expressive portraiture.\n> \"The faces seen on this look, as well as on previous LV garments featuring Taylor's artwork, are all drawn from his personal life -- family members, friends, and neighbors,\" said an LV representative in a statement released via People magazine.\nThe brand further confirmed that these portraits were part of Taylor's original artworks, shared with LVMH during the creation of Pharrell Williams' debut collection as Louis Vuitton's creative director in 2023.\n> \"None of the individuals depicted in the garments are Rosa Parks or other well-known figures from Black cultural history,\" the statement emphasized.\n* * *\n## Who Is Henry Taylor and Why Was He Chosen?\n### Celebrating Black Art in Fashion\nHenry Taylor is a renowned Black artist known for humanizing everyday people, especially from African-American communities. His collaboration with Pharrell Williams aimed to bring raw, emotional realism into luxury fashion, merging culture and couture in a meaningful way.\nUsing his personal subjects--neighbors, friends, family--Taylor's work avoids using celebrities or public figures. His aim is to spotlight real people often ignored by mainstream media and art.\nLisa's look, though misinterpreted, was intended to honor this spirit, not to exploit historical imagery.\n* * *\n## Lisa's Met Gala Look: Style Breakdown\n### The Outfit in Detail\n  * Top: Sharp black blazer with sheer side panels\n  * Bottoms: Custom lace underwear with Henry Taylor's portraits\n  * Accessories: Black Louis Vuitton clutch and matching black pumps\n  * Hair & Makeup: High-volume updo and soft neutral makeup tones\n\n\nDespite the controversy, fashion critics praised Lisa for taking a creative risk and embracing the Gala's theme with authenticity.\n* * *\n## Met Gala 2025: Bigger Than Ever\n### Record-Breaking Fundraiser\nThe annual Met Gala is not just a fashion event--it's a major fundraiser for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. According to organizers, this year's Gala raised $31 million, thanks to ticket sales, high-profile sponsorships, and celebrity-driven media buzz.\nLisa's appearance--controversial or not--definitely kept the Gala in the headlines and added to its cultural impact.\n* * *\n##  Fashion, Misinterpretation, and Cultural Sensitivity\nLisa's Met Gala appearance has sparked a larger conversation about representation, intention, and how quickly misinformation can spread online. While her outfit was falsely accused of portraying Rosa Parks in a questionable way, the truth highlights a more thoughtful and artistic collaboration.\nLouis Vuitton's prompt clarification may not reverse all public criticism, but it helps set the record straight.\nAs for Lisa, she has not yet publicly commented on the backlash--but knowing her, she'll continue to push boundaries while respecting the stories behind what she wears.",

In her signature deadpan delivery, Plaza's MJ helps Honey with her investigation, kicking off an adventure full of absurdity and intrigue.\nSoon, Honey arrives at the scene of a suspicious crash involving Mia Novotny, a woman who was found dead in her car. Honey spots a ring that hints at the Four-way Temple's involvement.\n* * *\n##  Suspicions and Seductions\n### Chris Evans Breaks the Mold as Reverend Drew\nOne moment in the trailer shows Evans' Reverend Drew getting _very_ unholy with two women--until the moment is interrupted by gunfire. Clearly, this isn't your average priest.\nHoney's suspicion of Drew grows when she visits Mia's house and uncovers hidden clues that the police have overlooked--or purposely ignored. She soon realizes this case is bigger and darker than it first seemed.\n* * *\n##  Comedy Meets Chaos: A Signature Coen Twist\nWhile the plot deals with murder and cults, the tone stays light with quirky humor and razor-sharp dialogue. A hilarious exchange between Honey and Reverend Drew serves as the trailer's comedic high point, filled with misdirection and awkward tension.\nThis balance between dark themes and laugh-out-loud moments is a signature Ethan Coen move, and it looks like _Honey Don 't!_ is following in the footsteps of classics like _Burn After Reading_ and _The Big Lebowski_.\n* * *\n##  Star-Studded Supporting Cast\nAside from the main trio, _Honey Don 't!_ boasts a vibrant ensemble:\n  * Charlie Day\n  * Billy Eichner\n  * Kristen Connolly\n  * Lena Hall\n  * Don Swayze\n  * Talia Ryder\n  * Gabby Beans\n  * Christian Antidormi  \n…and many more.\n\n\nEach actor seems perfectly cast to contribute to the film's chaotic and offbeat world.\n* * *\n##  Premiere and Release Details\n### Cannes Midnight Screening and Theatrical Release\nThe film will have its world premiere at the Midnight Screenings section of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, a spot often reserved for boundary-pushing, cult-favorite titles. From there, the movie will head to theaters across the United States on August 22, 2025.\nThis late summer release positions _Honey Don 't!_ as a must-see indie comedy with major mainstream appeal.\n* * *\n##  Why You Should Be Excited\n### Cult Thrills, Killer Cast, and Ethan Coen's Dark Humor\nIf you love:\n  * Coen brothers-style black comedies\n  * Detective mysteries with absurd characters\n  * Chris Evans playing _very_ against type\n  * Sharp, dry humor from Aubrey Plaza\n\n\n…then _Honey Don 't!_ is likely going to be your new favorite film of 2025.\n* * *\n##  What to Expect from _Honey Don 't!_\nElement| Details  \n---|---  \n**Genre**|  Dark Comedy / Crime Caper  \n**Director**|  Ethan Coen  \n**Main Cast**|  Margaret Qualley, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza  \n**Plot Focus**|  Cult-related deaths, private investigation, offbeat humor  \n**World Premiere**|  2025 Cannes Film Festival - Midnight Screenings  \n**US Release Date**|  August 22, 2025  \n**Trailer Tone**|  Witty, violent, mysterious, absurd  \n_Honey Don 't!_ looks like a bold and hilarious mix of murder mystery, cult weirdness, and quirky comedy.

    "content": "When you're planning a trip with friends, there's a good chance your group chat will be full of links to and screenshots of places you want to visit or cafes you want to hit. \nTo help you keep track of all that, Google is now rolling out a new feature to add [multiple locations to a Google Maps list for you using screenshots](https://blog.google/products/maps/how-to-google-maps-screenshot-save-gemini/ \"open in a new window\"). This feature scans your phone and uses [Gemini AI](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-ai-features-vacation-planning) to work out the places mentioned in your screenshots. It's starting out first first on iPhones (which is odd for Google), and it's limited to the US for now. However, Android and global releases are planned for the future.\n## How to automatically add places to Google Maps using screenshots\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nHere's how the new feature works. After updating the Google Maps app to the latest version, head over to the You tab. Here, you'll see a new list up top called Screenshots.\nTap on it, and Google Maps will ask for access to your photo library. Here, you can allow it full access to enable the auto-scan feature, or you can simply choose the photos you want it to scan manually. The feature works slightly differently based on what you choose. I'll start with the auto-scan instructions.\nIf you're on automatic, simply go about your life, taking screenshots of locations you're interested in as you normally would. These can include the name of a location, an address, or even a photo of a place. Once you're ready to add them to your Google Maps list, open the Google Maps app again. If the Maps app automatically recognizes a location, it will show a message saying that there are new places that are ready for you to review.\nTap the Review button and choose if you want to save the image and the places Google found to your Screenshots list or not. Once that's done, you can also add the places to a different list.\nHere's a detailed video on how the feature works:\n## How to manually add places to a Google Maps list using screenshots\nAlternatively, you can also manually add places to your Google Maps app using the Screenshots list, for more privacy.\nGo to the You tab and choose the Screenshots list. Here, upload the screenshots that you want the list to pull from.\nNow, Google Maps will analyze the images and will come back to you with the Review screen. Simply go through the locations that Google Maps found, and add the ones you want to the Screenshots list.\n## Should you let AI go through your screenshots?\nAs useful as this feature can be, the question remains, should you let Gemini access all the photos in your iPhone library just to save a couple of seconds searching for a place on Google Maps?\nIf that makes you uncomfortable, be sure to deny Google Maps full access to your photo library, even if you're not regularly using the Screenshots list feature. It's also good practice to periodically check on your photo permissions, which you can [read more about here](https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-should-double-check-which-apps-can-see-your-iphone-photos).",

    "title": "Google Messages Will Soon Let You Delete Messages for Everyone",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Not that long ago, sending a message was final. It didn't matter if you had an embarrassing typo, or you sent a message to the wrong person: Once you tapped that \"send\" button, you were locked in, and whoever that message was sent to would have it as long as they wanted. \nThese days, however, we have the technology to save ourselves from such embarrassment. Many chat apps now have options to retrieve a message after it was sent, whether by editing the message to fix a mistake, or the ability to delete a message from everyone in the chat. It doesn't guarantee that the people who received the message didn't see it, but it does remove that message from view. If they didn't catch it, they never will. \nPlenty of chat apps have this delete option today, from [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1370476507114859/?cms_platform=web \"open in a new window\") to [iMessage](https://lifehacker.com/you-can-finally-edit-and-undo-sent-messages-on-iphone-1849167883). But one notable exception has been Google Messages. If you send a message you didn't mean to send, you can edit it for up to 15 minutes, but you can't undo it. Luckily, that's beginning to change. 9to5Google originally [spotted the ability to delete messages from everyone back in February](https://9to5google.com/2025/05/08/google-messages-delete-for-everyone/ \"open in a new window\"). Now, it appears to be rolling out, slowly but surely. \nTo get specific, RCS, the messaging protocol that Google Messages now defaults to, has had this option since last July's \"Universal Profile 2.7\" update, which allowed users to \"Edit, Recall and Delete [messages] that they sent earlier for themselves and the message recipient.\"\n## How \"Delete for everyone\" works in Google Messages\nWhen the feature hits your Google Messages app, you'll now have two options when you delete a message. You'll have the \"Delete for me\" option, which behaves the same as deleting a message always has: it'll delete on your end, but not for anyone else. However, there's also now \"Delete for everyone,\" which will delete the message for all users running a compatible version of Google Messages. \nThat's the key here. While the message will be removed from users who have an updated, compatible version of Google Messages, it _won't_ be deleted from older app versions. It's the Achilles' heel of the feature, and it applies to most chat apps that offer it: You'll never _really_ know whether the message was deleted, unless you're certain all parties involved are running an up-to-date version of Google Messages.\nAccording to 9to5Google, the feature is also rolling out rather slowly at this time. They highlight [one user running the Google Messages beta](https://old.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ki4bpz/rcs_message_delete_is_also_rolling_out_to_beta/ \"open in a new window\") who has the feature for a group chat of 12 participants, but not for single chats. 9to5Google doesn't have the option on their end. \nFor the best shot at trying out the feature as soon as possible, you might want to enroll in the Google Messages beta. If you're OK risking a more unstable version of the messaging app, head to the [Google Messages Play Store page](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.messaging \"open in a new window\"), choose **BECOME A TESTER** , then follow the on-screen instructions to enroll.",

    "title": "20 of the Best Apple TV+ Original Movies",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nThough relatively new on the Hollywood scene (its first original film was released in 2019), Apple TV+'s slate of original films has included not just charming indies, but award-winning prestige pictures. _CODA_ was Oscar's best picture just a couple of years ago (the first film from a streaming service to claim the honor), and the streamer's movies earned it [13 nominations for 2023](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/where-to-stream-2024-oscar-nominees), even if it got nothing for 2024. (We all have off years.)\nGiven the complexities of film financing today, you might be excused for believing that many of these movies were typical theatrical releases--but, strictly speaking, these are all Apple TV+ originals. Sometimes they're only available through the app, but other times they have small (or significant) theatrical releases built in to their distribution model, if only to ensure they're eligible for major awards like the Oscars.\n## _The Gorge_ (2025)\nMiles Teller, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Sigourney Weaver star in this sci-fi/action/romance that became Apple TV's most-streamed movie launch ever upon its February release. Teller and Taylor-Joy play snipers tasked by a mysterious woman (Weaver) with guarding two sides of the title's gorge: He's a former U.S. Marine with symptoms of PTSD, she's a a Lithuanian covert operative with a dying father. The two are to stand watch for a full year in complete isolation to ensure that nothing comes out of the gorge, but things get complicated when the bored snipers start sending each other messages, increasing their communication until they start to question just what it is that they're meant to be guarding. **You can stream _The Gorge_ [here](https://zdcs.link/zjpMR1?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=zjpMR1&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Fly Me to the Moon_ (2024)\nThe sort of goofy rom-com that they don't make anymore (or so it's said), _Fly Me to the Moon_ rides on the strong chemistry between leads Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, as well as a premise so outrageous that it just about works. Tatum is Cole Davis, a (fictional) NASA launch director during the Apollo 11 era. He finds himself saddled with Johansson's Kelly Jones, a slightly unscrupulous marketer publicly charged with helping to sell the public on the importance of a Moon landing. But she has a secret mission, as well: She's charged with preparing a fake landing video to air if the real one fails. These two lock horns as the actual launch approaches, with Kelly coming to question her methods in the face of true-believer Cole. Director Greg Berlanti, best known for about a million DC Comics TV shows, follows up 2018's _Love, Simon_. **You can stream _Fly Me to the Moon_ [here](https://zdcs.link/QbbmJA?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QbbmJA&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Killers of the Flower Moon_ (2023)\nThough [it didn't take home Oscar gold](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/where-to-stream-2024-oscar-winners) (let's put Lily Gladstone in more movies, please), Martin Scorsese's latest has more than proven the octogenarian filmmaker hasn't lost a step. A story of creeping dread and existential terror in the American west, it chronicles the injustices that follow the discovery of oil on Osage tribal land in the 1920s. A good thing quickly goes bad when white political leaders plot a string of murders to keep the wealth from staying where it belongs. The film might have gone deeper in presenting the true story from its natural Indigenous perspective, but the finished product still represents an important and harrowing story well told. **You can stream _Killers of the Flower Moon_ [here](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/killers-of-the-flower-moon/umc.cmc.5x1fg9vferlfeutzpq6rra1zf \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Tragedy of Macbeth_ (2021)\nJoel Coen's sole (thus far) solo directing project represents a bold choice: a beautiful, strikingly minimalist adaptation of the Scottish play--lean and mean in its production and its impact. Only a director of Coen's confidence would mount a production like this without feeling the need to reinvent the wheel, letting Shakespeare dialogue and the performances of Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand do the heavy lifting. During the 2021/22 awards season, it received far more nominations than wins, but still stands as one of the best cinematic takes on Macbeth since Kurosawa's _Throne of Blood_. **You can stream _The Tragedy of Macbeth_ [here](https://zdcs.link/aBglwb?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=aBglwb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Blitz_ (2024) \nBritish director Steve McQueen (_Hunger_ , _12 Years a Slave_ , _Widows_) takes on the Blitz in this historical drama that's rousingly old-fashioned while also being revisionist in its willingness to upend our notions of the fighting spirit of British civilians during World War II. Saoirse Ronan plays Rita, single mom to a biracial son--her Grenadian partner was hounded by racists until he was forced to leave the country. She's a factory worker and a singer, struggling to survive in London's East End, where the poor are offered less protection than those in better-off parts of the city, and a single mother with a biracial child is treated a bit less well than that. It's not an entirely downbeat movie, and it's full of uplifting moments, but it's also not afraid to suggest that the Blitz of 1940 wasn't all \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\" **You can stream Blitz[here](https://zdcs.link/9YWkyx?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=9YWkyx&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Come From Away_ (2021)\nA full cinematic adaptation of this musical about the events that unfolded at a rural airport on 9/11 was in the works before the pandemic put a stop to them. Thus, a special stage production was mounted using members of the original cast, filmed before an audience of 9/11 survivors and frontline workers. While it's impossible to know what that other version might have been like, this one is probably better. The musical, which opened on Broadway in 2017, takes place in the Newfoundland town of Gander following the 2001 attacks. Gander had once been a major refueling hub, but that changed over time, leaving the town with an enormous airport and relatively little traffic--until airplanes were diverted there in the wake of the terrorist attacks. The stranded plane passengers briefly more than doubled the town's population, and Gander leaders and residents pulled out all the stops to care for the unexpected guests. Based on a true story, the show has a smart sense of humor and, while it's not cynical, it never succumb to schmaltz either. **You can stream _Come from Away_ [here](https://zdcs.link/aebMJA?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=aebMJA&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Wolfs_ (2024)\nJon Watts steps away from Marvel's _Spider-Man_ movies to direct this action comedy led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt; it's still a little hard to process that we're in a world where two A-list stars would get paired with a director whose grosses are in the multiple billions, and yet we're direct-to-streaming (technically, this did get a one-week pro forma theatrical release). Regardless, the finished product is quite fun: Amy Ryan plays Margaret, a Manhattan District Attorney who meets a young man in a bar who ends up dead(-ish) in her hotel room. She contacts a fixer (Clooney) to help clean up the mess and keep her out of trouble. Meanwhile, the hotel's owner (voiced by Frances McDormand) witnesses much of what went on, and has brought in a person of her own (Pitt) to protect her hotel from blowback. The two very solitary fixers are forced to work together, and, naturally, things get increasingly complicated: The dead young man isn't entirely dead, as it happens, but was involved in shenanigans that include drugs and the Albanian mafia. **You can stream _Wolfs_ [here](https://zdcs.link/aDgbOb?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=aDgbOb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues_ (2022)\nSacha Jenkins does an awful lot right in this biographical documentary about the American jazz legend, starting by offering new and archival interviews with musicians who've been influenced by Satchmo and his art: Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis, Amiri Baraka, Ossie Davis, etc. But what he really gets right is in allowing Armstrong to tell his own story--the legend kept shelves worth of diaries on reel-to-reel tape, and it's quickly clear that there's no one better suited to tell his story, his instantly recognizable voice offering frank insights that no one else could. It's a love letter to the jazz giant, one that, smartly, doesn't try to smooth out the rough edges. **You can stream _Black & Blues_ [here](https://zdcs.link/9gbeDG?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=9gbeDG&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Cha Cha Real Smooth_ (2022)\nYou might have missed Cooper Raiff's 2020 indie _Shithouse_ , a movie that earned great reviews on a $15,000 budget but couldn't overcome its unfortunate title. His follow-up, _Cha Cha Real Smooth_ , got a bit more attention. Andrew is a bar/bat mitzvah party planner who falls for Domino, a mom 10 years his senior (Dakota Johnson). It's occasionally cloying, but Raiff's complex script and range of characters make for a charming movie from a filmmaker to keep an eye on. **You can stream _Cha Cha Real Smooth_ [here](https://zdcs.link/z7O2V7?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=z7O2V7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie_ (2023)\nThe easy route would have been a tearjerking portrait of an inspirational figure--a one-time Hollywood golden boy bravely faces life with a debilitating illness. There's a bit of that in this documentary, but whenever that mood does overtake the film, it feels earned. Director Davis Guggenheim documents Fox's life with a thematic narrative through-line (an actor who could never be still in body or mind now struggles to do just that), even as it refuses to shy away from the knocks and bruises that attend any life with Parkinson's, nor from Fox's own complicated personality. The film works best when dealing with the overlaps, and disconnects, between Fox as a person and Fox as a public face of Parkinson's. **You can stream _Still_ [here](https://zdcs.link/91jLdw?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=91jLdw&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _CODA_ (2021)\nI'm not sure it was the _most_ worthy Best Picture Oscar winner, that doesn't detract from _CODA_ as a charming and altogether likable film about Ruby (Emilia Jones), a young musician who is the only hearing member of her family. She struggles with the demands of the family's fishing business even as she discovers a passion for singing and a new boyfriend. The premise involves a worn and silly trope about deaf people not understanding music, but it also depicts its characters as capable, complicated community leaders with actual sex lives. Emilia Jones is great in the lead, as are Marlee Matlin and Oscar-winner Troy Katsur as her parents. **You can stream CODA[here](https://zdcs.link/Q47vKG?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=Q47vKG&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Finch_ (2021)\nIn a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a dying engineer named Finch (Tom Hanks) works to build a robotic companion--not to serve as his companion, but to take care of his dog when he dies. Which is 1000% relatable, and more or less the extent of the plot. As end-time movies go, this one is surprisingly charming and family-friendly--Tom Hanks is a genial companion at the end of the world, and you won't be surprised that a story of a man having adventures just to make sure that his dog has a friend is definitely going to make you cry. **You can stream _Finch_ [here](https://zdcs.link/aAglA5?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=aAglA5&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Napoleon_ (2023)\nSandwiched between 2021's superior _The Last Duel_ and _Gladiator 2_ , Ridley Scott's 2023 somewhat-accurate biopic about the one-time emperor of France proves his is the only name in town when it comes to historical epics. The shorter, theatrical version of this one is a slightly muddled affair, turning on a sly, subtly comedic lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix while also building to a number of massive, more traditional set pieces (Scott smartly doesn't ask us to be overly enamored of the man himself). When it works, it offers up the old-fashioned thrills of a gorgeously designed period drama, with the types of grand battle sequences that we don't get in a world where every movie fight involves superheroes and spaceships. The director's cut (my preferred version), also on Apple TV+, is, surprisingly, sharper and funnier--but it adds nearly an hour to an already-long movie, so manage your time accordingly. **You can stream the theatrical cut[here](https://zdcs.link/QP8Y4W?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QP8Y4W&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****, and the longer director's cut[here](https://zdcs.link/985J77?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=985J77&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Pigeon Tunnel_ (2023)\nThe great Errol Morris (_Gates of Heaven_ , _The Thin Blue Line_ ,_The Fog of War_) turns his camera on writer David Cornwell, better known as John le Carre, one-time spy and preeminent writer of espionage novels. The title comes from a memory from the author's youth: visiting his father who was part of a pigeon-shooting concession--the pigeons were bred in captivity and then forced through a tunnel so that they'd be right in line for rich men to shoot them, just at what seemed like their moment of freedom. The metaphor of an escape that's actually a trap became a potent one in the author's life and work, and Morris drives into that lifelong theme with his typical depth and style. **You can stream _The Pigeon Tunnel_ [here](https://zdcs.link/QKglwn?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QKglwn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Wolfwalkers_ (2020)\nRobyn Goodfellowe is apprenticed to her father as a hunter, the two of them traveling to Ireland to wipe out the last of the land's wolves. Going off on her own, she encounters a free-spirited girl who needs Robyn's help to find her mother; the girl's tribe is rumored to have the ability to change into wolves, and Robyn's alliance with her new friends threatens her relationship with her father. This stunningly hand-drawn animated film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination, and follows a thematic trilogy that began with the same filmmakers' _The Secret of Kells_ (2009) and _Song of the Sea_ (2014). They're all independent of one another story-wise, but if you love this one, you'll undoubtedly enjoy all three. **You can stream _Wolfwalkers_ [here](https://zdcs.link/QWYXym?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QWYXym&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Hala_ (2019)\nMost audiences seemed to overlook Apple's first original narrative movie when it was released back in 2019, and that's too bad. Written and directed by Minhal Baig, a native of Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, the movie has a distinctive sense of place, particularly for anyone who grew up in the Chicago area. But its primary strength is as a smart, sensitive coming-of-age story. Geraldine Viswanathan plays the title's Hala Masood, a teenager from a strict Muslim family who falls for a non-Muslim boy at school, setting up a conflict that also brings a few family secrets out into the open. **You can stream _Hala_ [here](https://zdcs.link/9YWkVd?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=9YWkVd&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Elephant Queen_ (2018)\nChiwetel Ejiofor narrates this nature documentary from directors Victoria Stone and Mark Deeble, following 50-year-old mother elephant Athena as she leads her family from their bucolic home into more treacherous terrain after a drought threatens their survival. The team kept track of the family in the African savannah over the course of four years, charting the intelligence and familial bonds of the animals, as well as the harsh choices imposed on them by the natural environment. **You can stream _The Elephant Queen_ [here](https://zdcs.link/zEgl5y?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=zEgl5y&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Swan Song_ (2021)\nWriter/director Benjamin Cleary presents a poignant existential dilemma in this low-key science fiction drama starring Mahershala Ali as Cameron Turner, a husband and father suffering from a terminal illness. To spare his wife (Naomie Harris) and children from the trauma and pain of his impending death, he's considering a new procedure offered by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close): He'll continue to hide his illness from his family, and be replaced by a clone with all of his memories. He'll spend his last months alone, but knowing his family won't have to confront his loss. In the best sci-fi tradition, the film explores the questions of identity, meaning, and loss that such hypothetical technology raises--without feeling like an overlong episode of _Black Mirror._**You can stream _Swan Song_ [here](https://zdcs.link/QVXrgY?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QVXrgY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Velveteen Rabbit_ (2023)\nIt's only around 40 minutes, so this blend of live-action and animation is more of a short than a feature, but its length and refusal to belabor its own point are strengths, not weaknesses.Seven-year-old William (Phoenix Laroche) moves with his family to a new home, where he struggles to settle in and make friends. A Christmas gift of the titular rabbit sets William's imagination free, and the boy's love gives the rabbit a life of its own alongside the other toys in the playroom. When William gets sick, the Velveteen Rabbit has a tough choice to make and, if you know the story, this is _approximately_ when the tears start welling up in your eyes. The animated segments use a variety of gorgeous animation styles, which really sells the complexity and variety of William's imagination. **You can stream _The Velveteen Rabbit_ [here](https://zdcs.link/aMJGrg?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=aMJGrg&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Sidney_ (2022)\nReginald Hudlin (_House Party_ , _Marshall_) directs this straightforward, nevertheless essential portrait of actor, director, and diplomat Sidney Poitier. The film not only captures the scope of one of the most significant and consequential figures in film and American culture in the 20th century--it also has the poignant virtue of being Poitier's last onscreen appearance before his death at the age 94. **You can stream _Sidney_ [here](https://zdcs.link/QVXrw3?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=here&short_url=QVXrw3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Now more than ever, it's time to curb your [online shopping habit](https://lifehacker.com/money/what-todays-tariff-update-means-for-your-online-shopping-habit). The Trump administration's tariffs will hit American families hard, with [_estimates ranging_](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025 \"open in a new window\") from nearly $4,000 to almost $8,000 per household. With a general attitude of \"[recession indicators\"](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/tech/recession-indicators-tariffs-memes-cec \"open in a new window\") all around us, one thing is clear: Times are tight.  \n  \nAnd as time goes on, your restrictive behavior can swing too far in the other direction, leading to something called \"revenge spending.\" If you've found yourself responding to tight times with overcompensatory spending, here's what you can do to get your budget back on track.\n## What is \"revenge spending\"?\nAs the name suggests, revenge spending occurs when you throw your money around as a way to \"get back\" after experiencing a period of financial hardship--whether a job layoff or, say, [a trade war](https://lifehacker.com/money/tariff-scams-to-watch-out-for). This sort of spending behavior can be thought of as a backlash to the scarcity mindset. You're suddenly spending more money to make up for lost time. It doesn't sound rational, because it isn't. \nI've [argued before](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-treat-your-budget-like-a-healthy-diet-1850860460) that sticking to a budget is like sticking to a diet. And if you've ever tried restricting your calories, you know that a binge is inevitable. Revenge spending is like that binge. And like with yo-yo dieting, you could soon you find yourself trapped in a cycle of behavioral extremes.\n## Create a values-based budget\nFor any trouble with spending and saving, making a [budget](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-budget-for-summer) is necessary--something like the [50/15/5 rule](https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you) is a great place to start. Of course, following it easier said than done, especially when there's an emotional issue at the root of your spending.\nRather than focusing on restriction, the [_values-based budget_](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-make-a-values-based-budget) aligns spending with your personal values and priorities. To start, make a list of the things that matter most to you financially. This may include saving for retirement, taking dream vacations, buying a home, or building an emergency fund. Define specific goals within each value category and determine how much money you'll need to fulfill them. Then, as you're mapping out your budget, allocate more resources to high-value categories. On the flip side, reduce spending in areas that don't align with your core values.\n## Try cash stuffing\nIf you need a mental nudge to stick to your budget, the physicality of being faced with an empty envelope is much more powerful than checking your online bank account.\nHere's where[ cash stuffing](https://lifehacker.com/start-cash-stuffing-to-curb-your-spending-1849945750) comes in. Label different physical envelopes and fill them with cash earmarked for different expenses. Stuff each envelope with a budgeted amount of cash for that month (or pay period). The key is, you can only spend money in a certain category from the cash in its designated envelope--once the envelope is empty, that's that for the month.\nCash stuffing works because it forces you to be more intentional (deciding how much money gets allocated into your envelopes) and more disciplined (you can't put more money into the envelope once it runs out).\n## Stick to a \"to-buy\" list\nAnother place to start with your specific spending goals is to **physically write down the things you want to buy _before_ you buy them**. Use those bank statements to inform what items make your official \"to-buy list.\" When you read over items on this list, you'll be able to make a more thoughtful decision as to what you really _need._\n## Recognize your spending triggers\nLike I mention above, revenge spending doesn't feel \"rational.\" You may not be proud of your revenge spending habit, but you can tackle it in a rational way. \nTake time to reflect on your recent revenge-buys. What emotional state were you in? Were you stressed about something else in your life? Write down any patterns you can see, so you can regain control over those moments where your desire to spend is strongest. \n## Remember: moderation is key\nRemember, too much restriction is what led to your revenge spending problem in the first place. Forming a healthy relationship money means indulging _thoughtfully_. Ask yourself, \"How do I expect this purchase will make me feel? What do I want it to make me feel? What feelings am I trying to _avoid_ by buying it?\"\nOnly you can determine what is truly valuable in your life, whether that's the occasional latte from your local coffee shop or saving up for a luxurious vacation every year. Allow yourself to indulge, especially if these indulgences improve your overall relationship with money.\nFor more, check out how you can [curb your unconscious spending here](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-unconscious-spending).",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "I don't really use AI. At least part of this, I think, is the user interface most large language models (LLMs) are presented in: the chatbot. I never think to open a dedicated window and ask a fictional person for help--I find it a clumsy way to interact with a computer. Why can't the AI help me in the places I'm already working?\nThat's the idea behind [Cotypist](https://cotypist.app/ \"open in a new window\"), a (currently) free Mac application by developer [Daniel Grafe](https://gloria.social/@daniel \"open in a new window\") that adds mobile-style autocomplete to every application on your Mac. The tool, which uses an offline LLM running on your device, requires an Apple Silicon processor (16 GB of RAM is recommended).\nWhile you're typing, predictive text (in gray) appears to the right of your cursor, no matter what application you're using. You can hit \"Tab\" to accept everything suggested or \"`\" (the key right above Tab) to accept the next word. The idea is that the AI makes writing faster by suggesting words you were going to type anyway--accept the words you wanted and ignore the ones you didn't. Grafe calls this kind of writing \"dancing with the AI,\" which is a romantic notion.\nSetting things up is fairly straightforward. After installing the application and launching it, you'll get a short tutorial. You'll need to enable the permissions needed by the application. You'll also need to wait for the application to download a large language model (the application automatically picks the most powerful model likely to run well on your device). After that's set up, you'll start seeing suggestions.\nThe menu bar icon allows you to disable suggestions in particular apps. Credit: Justin Pot\nYou can configure a few things using the menu bar icon; e.g., you can disable suggestions in a particular application for a set amount of time or indefinitely. This is helpful if you're tripping over the suggestions in some apps but find them useful in others. You can also click the settings option to change the keyboard shortcuts for accepting suggestions.\nSetting a custom set of instructions for the AI in Cotypist. Credit: Justin Pot\nYou can also set system-wide instructions for the bot. This is basically a block of text that the AI will use to guide the suggestions it makes--the documentation suggests you include information like your name, your profession, and any guidance you want the AI to follow while writing.\nI've been using Cotypist, off and on, for about a week now. Every once and a while it accurately predicts where I'm going and suggests the right words, saving me a few keystrokes. Most of the time, though, I find myself distracted by the suggestions. This might have something to do with my writing style--I'm a pretty fast typist, and I usually know the next word I'm going to type before I actually type it.\nThe thing about writing, though, is that it's intensely personal--everyone does it a little bit differently. I can imagine this being a useful tool for someone whose brain works a little differently than mine, or someone who struggles with typing. If you're curious whether this tool will fit your workflow, I highly recommend giving it a spin.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "AI bots want to help with your web searches as well as everything else, and [Claude](https://claude.ai/ \"open in a new window\") is the latest artificial intelligence assistant to get the ability to look up information online--whether that's the latest news headlines or the latest prices on gadgets.\n\"With web search, Claude has access to the latest events and information, boosting its accuracy on tasks that benefit from the most recent data,\" [says developer Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search \"open in a new window\"). The feature is available now across all paid plans, and is \"coming soon\" for free users.\nWeb search is a different kind of challenge for AI models, testing their ability to sift through and assess content published on the web, rather than embedded in its training data. Here's how Claude gets on--and compares to Google Gemini and ChatGPT.\n## Using web search in Claude\nEnabling the web search feature. Credit: Lifehacker\nTo give Claude web access, click the sliders button in the prompt box, and enable the **Web search** toggle switch. The AI bot will then refer to the web at large as and when it deems it appropriate to your query, but if you want to make sure it uses online information as part of its response, include something like \"search the web\" in your prompt.\nWhen a web search is invoked, Claude will notify you as part of the response, and typically takes a little longer to come back with an answer. When the answer does appear, you get small citation buttons at the end of certain sentences, so you know where the information has come from. Click any citation to jump to that website in a new tab.\nYou can run just about any query you might type into Google, covering everything from weather forecasts and sports scores to deep dives into music history and help with fixing computer problems. As usual, you can then follow up with more questions about the results Claude has given you.\nIt's easy to see the potential for AI to upend the way we search the web, in how it offers a more natural, nuanced experience than the standard list of links on Google. It's not without its problems though--not least whether these AI bots [can be trusted](https://lifehacker.com/tech/ai-models-hallucinating-more), and where they're going to get their information from if real human beings have no incentive to [publish on the web](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/maybe-ai-slop-is-killing-the-internet-after-all \"open in a new window\") any more.\n## Getting the news of the day\nPicking out the current tech news. Credit: Lifehacker\nI tasked Claude with bringing me the tech news headlines of the day, and in fact it ran two web searches to make sure it got everything. I read the tech news every day, and Claude did an okay job, here: The stories were mostly new, and mostly relevant, though the citation links tended to go to front pages of news sites, rather than individual articles.\nGemini was about on a par with Claude, though it did manage to link to specific articles, not just news hubs. Almost every result was from the last few days, taken from a reputable source, and relatively significant in the world of tech news, though there were some misses--a new Samsung phone in India, for example, which I don't really care about.\nOver to ChatGPT, and the OpenAI bot was probably the worst of the lot when it came to returning results I cared about from sites that are the most respected in the tech news space (though you could argue that's a subjective call). It still did fine, but I preferred the results I got from Claude and Gemini.\nWhen asked to return the latest news from Lifehacker, Claude couldn't do it, and ChatGPT just listed the headlines from the current home page without links. Gemini actually gave me the latest stories, complete with links, so works the best here--though the better option is probably just to open Lifehacker in your browser.\n## Checking facts online\nClaude knows its movies... or rather, knows to check Wikipedia. Credit: Lifehacker\nOnto fact checking: I tested Claude with a movie question I already know the answer to. How many Oscars were won by _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_? It got the right answer, and the right year, and gave the context that it's only the third film in history to get all five big Academy Awards: Best director, best actor, best actress, best picture, and best adapted screenplay (see if you can guess what the other two movies are).\nGemini also got the answers and the context of the big five win. Its sources covered a wider variety of sites and even YouTube, whereas Claude stuck to Wikipedia and the official Oscars site. It gave a shorter, more terse response than Claude, and didn't include background information on box office takings.\nAs for ChatGPT, it again managed to put together an accurate answer, with the useful context about the big five success and the other movies that have managed the feat. Like Claude, it stuck mainly to Wikipedia, but it did something neither Claude nor Gemini did: It included a video from YouTube of the best picture Oscar presentation.\nThese kinds of web searches aren't particularly taxing. More complex questions may pose more problems, especially if the answers aren't readily available and the AI gets tempted to make them up. I did try and trick these AI bots into thinking Daniel Day-Lewis won two best actor Oscars in consecutive years, but all three correctly identified that this never happened.\n## Going shopping with AI\nClaude isn't much use for shopping on the web. Credit: Lifehacker\nOnline shopping could be transformed by AI. While actual people will always be [better than bots](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-for-gift-ideas) at picking out the right purchases, AI can quickly scrape and summarize the opinions of real human beings and package them in a clean, friendly interface while taking a cut of the sales. It's like having a smart assistant with you, with no need to wade though masses of information or search results.\nI asked Claude to recommend a quirky present for myself, based around sports or movies, and it dutifully searched for pages listing quirky sports and movie gifts. It did fine at picking out some ideas, but I think this is one query I could've just run myself through Google without troubling AI.\nGemini gave a more personalized, chattier response. It didn't provide any web links in this case, perhaps because Google wants to keep you going to its main search engine for these sorts of queries: Unlike Claude or ChatGPT, Google already makes a lot of money getting users to click through on purchasing links from its shopping search results.\nChatGPT gave the most useful results here, perhaps thanks to [its recent shopping upgrade](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11146633-improved-shopping-results-from-chatgpt-search \"open in a new window\"). The sources it listed were similar to the ones Claude used, but it provided some distinct top picks, together with pricing and links to buy them on the web. Further down the line, this could well be one of the ways OpenAI makes back some of its money.\nWeb search is clearly still a work in progress for all these AI tools. In some cases it works better than a traditional Google search, but not always, and there's always the issue of how far you can trust these confident, polished answers without checking on the original sources they're getting their information from.\n_Disclosure: Lifehacker 's parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems._",

It handles the basics just fine, but you might notice some lag when jumping between menus or loading up bigger libraries. It also skips out on Apple AirPlay and Google Cast, so screen mirroring from an iPhone or iPad is not an option. Also, since it runs on Wi-Fi 5 instead of Wi-Fi 6, your streaming speeds could take a hit if your network's already busy.

    "title": "That Online Joann Fabric and Crafts Sale Is a Scam",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "When a big-box store files for bankruptcy and goes out of business, there's often an opportunity to buy its products at rock-bottom prices. But scammers are taking advantage of our love of a good deal: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [is warning consumers](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/05/avoid-online-joann-impersonators-and-their-fake-sales \"open in a new window\") about online clearance sales being advertised by fraudsters impersonating Joann Fabric and Crafts. \nJoann Fabric and Crafts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (twice) and in February 2025 [announced plans to shutter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/24/joann-closing-stores-locations/80022854007/ \"open in a new window\") its stores with going-out-of-business sales. On March 5, the business disabled purchases on its website, but scammers have been promoting online clearance sales using ads on social media sites and running away with customer payments. \n## How the Joann sale scam works\nAccording to the FTC notice, fraudsters are posting ads for an online Joann bankruptcy sale on Facebook, Pinterest, and Nextdoor. When you click the ad, you'll land on a fake sale site with deals listed and the ability to actually \"purchase\" inventory items. You'll even get a receipt. \nUnfortunately, that money is going directly into scammers' pockets--the charge on your credit card will be something other than Joann, and you won't receive what you ordered. \n## How to avoid online sale scams\nWhether it's Joann's going-out-of-business event or another sale with supposedly great deals, use caution before buying. Scams of all kinds prey on emotions based in urgency, so don't immediately pull out your credit card for limited-time deals or too-good-to-be-true prices. \nDon't click on ads for online sales--always go directly to the company's website by typing in the URL to verify that a sale is real. In Joann's case, there is a notice on the website about fraudulent online sales that states, \"There are no other authorized Joann shopping sites.\" \nIf you do shop clearance sales, pay with a credit card and keep receipts. Credit cards have more protections than debit cards in cases of fraud and non-delivery of items you paid for--you can [dispute charges](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products#disputing \"open in a new window\") and receive a refund.",

    "title": "Five Ways to Get More Out of Letterboxd",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Letterboxd is the best thing to happen to film nerds since IMDb, which is almost surprising given how straightforward it is. Like the Film Twitter answer to Goodreads, it is a social network/online catalogue where you can rate or review movies, pick a few of your favorites to highlight on your profile, and follow your friends and favorite critics. Yet, Letterboxd is more than just \"what if social media, but for movies?\" Dig a little deeper and you'll find some useful tools for managing your cinema obsession.\nIf you haven't used Letterboxd before, it's available for [_Android_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.letterboxd.letterboxd \"open in a new window\"), [_iOS_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/letterboxd/id1054271011 \"open in a new window\"), or on [_the web_](https://letterboxd.com/ \"open in a new window\"). Anyone can access it to browse movies, read reviews, and see user ratings, but in order to make a watchlist or leave your own reviews, you'll need to create a (free) account. \nAnd that's where the fun begins. You can assemble and share your own lists of movies group by any classification you want, from [WWII movies in chronological order](https://letterboxd.com/mike_v_e/list/ww2-cinematic-universe/ \"open in a new window\") to [movies with the highest kill counts](https://letterboxd.com/pretzeljack/list/high-kill-count-movies/ \"open in a new window\"). You can add tags to organize your collections of films you've watched or want to watch, get recommendations from the community, and (with a paid subscription) even customize the display page for every movie and get notified when stuff on your to-watch list arrives on streaming.\nHere are five ways to get more out of Letterboxd.\n## Create custom watchlists\nA huge part of what makes Letterboxd so appealing is that when you find a movie you want to see, you can add it to your Watchlist to remember for later. (Just press the big + button on the bottom right, then tap Watchlist.) This is also _kind of_ the app's biggest weakness. It's nice at first, but as your Watchlist grows, it becomes just as difficult to choose something to watch from it as it is [scrolling endlessly through Netflix](https://theonion.com/netflix-introduces-new-browse-endlessly-plan-1819595604/ \"open in a new window\"). \nThis is where custom lists come in handy. A bit below the Watchlist button, you'll see \"Add to lists,\" which lets you create your own public or private lists. Instead of dumping everything into your standard Watchlist, you should create lists for different genres, different actors, different decades, or even solely based on vibes. \nI can't recommend this practice enough. It's a couple of extra steps, especially as you first start to create lists, but it makes Letterboxd so much more useful. My partner and I use a shared list for movies we want to watch together when we have a movie night. I keep a separate list for horror movies I know they won't want to see, and another list for my favorite movies I know I can rewatch over and over. This simple feature turns Letterboxd into your own personal Spotify for movies, albeit one where you are in sole control of the \"algorithm.\"\n## Get better recommendations with public lists\nYour own lists are a great way to organize your collection of movies you've watched or want to watch, but you may not even need to bother creating them, since Letterboxd users _love_ to create their own lists and share them. If the almighty algorithm on your favorite streaming service isn't coming up with a good recommendation, browse Letterboxd's public lists.\nWhen I say users love making these lists, I mean it. Take, for example, this list of movies \"[_for when you want to feel something_](https://letterboxd.com/ellefnning/list/for-when-you-want-to-feel-something/ \"open in a new window\")\" that not only has great recs like _Up_ or _Parasite_ , but is organized by _poster color_. Or this creative list that [_pairs classic romantic films with similar modern counterparts_](https://letterboxd.com/stateofhailey/list/if-you-like-this-romcom-watch-this-older/ \"open in a new window\") to help you find older films you might like.\nSince these public lists are created by actual humans, if you find a person whose tastes you like, you can follow them. If someone puts a ton of work into curating one list, there's a decent chance they have others you might also like. Unlike most algorithm-controlled social media apps, Letterboxd makes it easy to see a real, human connection to another person.\n## Organize your collections with tags\nSeparate lists are better than one giant Watchlist, but for my money, tags are a superior organizing system (though they both serve their purposes). You can create your own custom tags when adding or editing a review of a movie--as many as you want--and give as many movies those tags as you deem necessary.\nTags work best for marking genres or traits movies have in common, but that don't necessarily need their own dedicated list. For example, you might tag some of your movies as \"wholesome\" or \"gut wrenching\" depending on [_what happens to the dog in the end_](https://www.doesthedogdie.com/ \"open in a new window\").\nYou can also get more creative with your tags. For example, one of my favorite tags is  \"mental health metaphors,\" for films that have interesting allegories for mental illness; or \"eat the rich,\" a very particular subgenre that is [_surprisingly robust_](https://letterboxd.com/search/lists/eat+the+rich/ \"open in a new window\"). I even have the tag \"haha what the f\" for those movies that are just [too incomprehensible to explain](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/weirdest-movies-you-wont-believe-exist).\nYou can add tags by selecting to \"Review or log\" a movie, though you can leave the review text blank. As you add more tags, you can browse and sort movies with them. On your profile, you'll find a tab for your tags, and you can browse all the tags you've created and see all the movies that match them.\n## Get notified when movies hit streaming (with a Pro subscription)\nThe free version of Letterboxd is pretty great, but a Pro subscription takes it a step further. The Pro tier costs $19 per year, which averages out to about $1.58 per month. (Though there's no month-to-month option, only an annual plan.).\nOn the Pro tier, you won't see any ads on the service, which is already a win--sometimes Letterboxd's ad placement is so weird that it obscures the site's key features. (Hot tip: scroll past the ad on your profile to find your reviews and lists!) If you use the app a lot, getting rid of ads is already worth the entry fee.\nThe star of the Pro show, though, is the streaming service filter: Add the streaming services you use, and any time any movie on your watchlist comes to one of those services, you'll get a notification in the app. \n## Pick your posters and get your name featured (with a Patron subscription)\nOne level above the Pro tier is the Patron subscription, which costs $49 a year. This is the tier you want to go with if you're feeling Letterboxd so much you want to throw extra support to the developers. Which is fair--it's kind of incredible how much of this app's functionality is completely free.\nOn the Pro tier, you do get a couple of extra perks. You can customize the poster that is displayed for the movies you've logged or added to a list. These alternate posters will be visible to you, as well as any other users who have opted in to seeing different posters in their settings. You can also add backdrops to your profiles, lists, and reviews to make them look a bit flashier.\nSpeaking of, since this is a social site, you'll also have a blue \"Patron\" label next to your username (Pro supporters get an orange \"Pro\" badge). It's nothing more than a cosmetic addition, but it is a nice way to feel a part of a community of film nerds all sharing what they love. If you're obsessed with movies and want to share that passion with everyone else, Letterboxd is for you.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "If you've had your Apple devices for a while, you probably think you know them pretty well. You have your various routines, habits, and hacks and you do what you need to do. But over the years, Apple has added a _lot_ of features to its flagship products--[including plenty of hidden gestures you might not know about](https://lifehacker.com/weird-hidden-iphone-gestures-you-probably-never-knew-ex-1848749693). As [MacRumors reminded us this week](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/instantly-share-photos-apple-devices \"open in a new window\"), one of those gestures is actually well-suited for sharing photos and videos across your various Apple devices, and in some cases, is probably faster than AirDrop.\nThe gesture itself is simple enough: Just open a photo or video, then take three fingers (your thumb, index, and middle finger) and pinch in on the image. If done successfully, you'll see a \"Copy\" pop-up appear at the top of the display. (Due to the gesture, you may also dismiss the image as well, but as long as you copied it, you're good to go.) You can also simply copy text or an image the old-fashioned way, by highlighting the text and copying it, or long-pressing on an image and tapping \"Copy.\" \nFrom here, you could paste the photo or video wherever you want it to go, by either tapping a text field and choosing \"Paste,\" or by pinching out with three fingers instead of pinching in. However, the real convenience of this trick is to take advantage of the Apple ecosystem's Universal Clipboard feature, which lets you copy and paste items across devices. So, you could copy a photo on your iPhone and instantly paste it on your Mac, or copy a video from your iPad and paste it to your iPhone. (This gesture unfortunately doesn't work on Mac, even those with trackpads.) \nIn order for this to work, your devices need to be signed into the same Apple Account and be connected to the same wifi network with Bluetooth enabled. In addition, you need to turn on Handoff on all devices. You might already have this setting on, but just in case, go to**Settings (System Settings on Mac) > General > Airplay & Continuity > Handoff**. \nWith Handoff enabled on all devices, rinse and repeat: On your iPhone or iPad, go ahead an try a three-finger pinch on any photo or video you have loaded up. Then, paste it to another device you have open. \nThe next time you have a photo or video on one device you need on another, give this a shot over other methods, like AirDrop or texting yourself. Not only is it quicker to share the file, you'll already have pasted the media where it needs to be. Win-win.",

    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\n_Welcome to \"_Cookbook of the Week._\" This is a series where I highlight cookbooks that are unique, easy to use, or just special to me. While finding a particular recipe online serves a quick purpose, flipping through a truly excellent cookbook has a magic all its own._ \nMy sweet tooth has been nagging me lately. I expect this is because I've been trying to eat more vegetables and my dopamine hormones find this to be disrespectful. I like veggies, but I'm only so powerful to resist the call of sweets. In one of my bookstore browsings, I came upon a cookbook with hefty slices of lemony-looking pie with a chocolate crust scattered across the cover and snapped it up. It's not a new book, but that's one of my favorite things about cookbooks: they don't have to be new or trendy to be great. This week's Cookbook of the Week is _Justice of the Pies_.\n## A bit about the book\n _Justice of the Pies_ is a cookbook as well as a bakery by the same name in Chicago, Illinois, with Maya-Camille Broussard at the wheel. The bakery was created to honor her late father, a criminal defense attorney and a man that brought joy to those around him with his Saturday pies. (As a big fan of puns and desserts, brava on the name.)\nThis book has over 85 recipes and, as expected, most of them are pies or tarts, and if they're not, well then they're at least circular (like whoopie pies or biscuits). Don't expect your typical panel of pie flavors from Broussard. You thought strawberry-rhubarb was clever? How about roasted Brussels sprouts and cherry? Perhaps a slice of bleu cheese praline pear pie is more your speed? Prepare to explore your creative side with some interesting flavor combinations. \nFor those who don't think much of dessert pies, don't fret, because not everything in here is sweet. Check out chapters like Savory Pies, Quiches, and Tarts for some savory numbers.\n## A great cookbook for some freakin' positivity\nThere are loads of absolutely mouth-watering recipes in _Justice of the Pies_ , complemented by moody, rich photography. Every recipe is designed to light up your taste buds, fill your belly, and satisfy that pang in your sweet tooth. I made the sweet potato praline pie (more on that in a moment) and from what I can tell in making that recipe and studying others, there is no pretense here for diet food. These are meals and desserts that have been crafted to elicit a smile or a gasp of excitement from your family and friends. (There is also a peaches and herb cobbler in here that might make you feel good in other ways if you choose to make the weed-infused butter.) \nScattered in between the recipes are human spotlight stories. They each tell an uplifting story about a person or group of people who wanted to bring positive change to their communities, whether it's addressing food insecurity or resolving to throw birthday parties for children who are housing insecure. These stories deliver a dose of positivity and hopefully provide inspiration to support community efforts in our own ways. These stories echo back to Broussard's own initiatives, like her I Knead Love workshops that provide food education to children right there in the bakery. It's food with intention. \n## The dish I made this week\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nLike I teased above, I made the sweet potato praline pie this week. I didn't make it easy on myself, as this recipe has three different parts. It's a reminder that if I plan on making more pies this summer that it's not a bad idea to double or triple her all-butter pie dough recipe and just keep a few stored in the freezer for future use. \nThe crust is a classic butter recipe with only four ingredients, so you don't have to worry about reinventing the wheel here. There are some recipes that add an egg or drop in some vodka, and it all gets a little irritating. (I'm guilty of overcomplicating pie crust.) It turns out, [_pie crust just doesn 't need to be hacked_](https://lifehacker.com/pie-dough-doesnt-need-to-be-hacked-1840002661).\nThe filling is what I was most interested in. I adore sweet potatoes at all times, but they're especially charming when mashed up with brown sugar and loads of butter and baked into a pie shell. This pie preparation was straightforward and positively laden with those two important ingredients. I appreciated Broussard's clear instructions and tips; they told me what to look out for without being long winded. For example, after the filling is completely mixed, it looks like a mistake. All of the butter specks separate from the mixture and I could see this breaking someone's heart if they didn't know any better. Broussard drops in a quick line that you'll know it's done mixing when you see those very specks show up.\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nAs for the flavor, all sweet potato fans will be in tuber heaven. This recipe instructs you to mash the sweet potatoes rather than blend them, which gives the pie a little more structural integrity, rather than a baby food texture I've gotten with other recipes. The pie finishes with a slightly puckered look due to the butter specks melting away, and the high sugar content gives it a caramelized top. This pie is rich and sweet; perfect for a cup of coffee. I'm looking forward to that tomorrow morning. \n## How to buy it\nYou can buy the hardcover (which is beautiful) of [__Justice of the Pies__ _online_](https://zdcs.link/9l3MgW?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Justice%20of%20the%20Pies%20online&short_url=9l3MgW&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), and because it's a couple years old, you can find a good deal.

Or, if you're a bookstore butterfly like myself (bookstore bee? Still workshopping it), check out your local Barnes & Noble, stop into Warwick's, or call up your neighborhood independent bookstore to see if they can order it for you.\n[ Justice of the Pies: Sweet and Savory Pies, Quiches, and Tarts plus Inspirational Stories from Exceptional People: A Baking Book  $4.99 at Amazon Shop Now  Shop Now  $4.99 at Amazon ](https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJustice-Pies-Quiches-Inspirational-Exceptional-ebook%2Fdp%2FB09QP98D5D%2Fref%3Dtmm_kin_swatch_0&template=Opinions&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&position=1&element_label=Justice+of+the+Pies%3A+Sweet+and+Savory+Pies%2C+Quiches%2C+and+Tarts+plus+Inspirational+Stories+from+Exceptional+People%3A+A+Baking+Book&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&product_uuid=03MlqpeoXUQ6u8aXdI8B5xz&offer_uuid=05RW0Yifa181S55txcyjx9n&pageview_type=RSS&object_type=05RW0Yifa181S55txcyjx9n&object_uuid=03MlqpeoXUQ6u8aXdI8B5xz&data-aps-asin=B09QP98D5D&data-aps-asc-tag=lifehack088-20&data-aps-asc-subtag=05RW0Yifa181S55txcyjx9n \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "YouTube is an amazing tool. If there's anything you want to do, from playing an instrument to fixing household appliances, there is a video on the site somewhere outlining exactly how to do it. The problem: YouTube doesn't always act like a tool. It's easy to get sucked down a rabbit hole of related videos, comments, and other distractions (mostly because the site it designed to make sure you do exactly that). \nIf you wish YouTube behaved more like a tool and less like a dopamine factory, I recommend [Untrap](https://untrap.app/ \"open in a new window\"). This browser extension, available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, lets you make almost 300 tweaks to the YouTube website, allowing you to remove the distracting features and enable a few useful ones by default.\nTo get started, install the extension and click the icon. You will see a few useful options, including the ability to hide all shorts, but to find the really useful things, click the **All Settings** box at the bottom. This lets you browse tweaks for every page on the YouTube website, including video pages, the home page, and the search results.\nI suggest starting with the place you spend most of your time: video pages. Scroll through the list and you'll find various tweaks you can make. The first thing I did was turn on \"Hide Related Videos\" and turn on \"Automatically Show Chapters.\" This immediately transforms the space to the right of the video from a rabbit hole of distractions into a tool you can use to browse the currently playing video with intention to find the exact information you're looking for. \nCredit: Justin Pot\nThere are more great features here. You can disable the suggestions that show up at the end of the video. You can force the theater mode, meaning the video will always take up the full width of the screen. You can automatically extend the video description, meaning you'll never again have to click the little \"More\" button in order to find the link that you're looking for. You can even disable the comments completely, if you wish you spent less time scrolling through them. You're in control. \nThere are similar options for YouTube's homepage, the subscriptions page, and even the search results. If there's anything about YouTube's interface that you find distracting or generally not useful, just disable it. In an ideal world, YouTube (and every other site) would work this way, but it's nice that there are tools out there that let you customize things.",

Shoes are updated every year or two, depending on the model; the long-running [Nike Pegasus](https://zdcs.link/9gbeYG?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nike%20Pegasus&short_url=9gbeYG&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is up to version 41.\nAnd just as with cars, you can often snag a deal at the end of the model year when sellers get rid of their old stock to make room for the newcomers. You can follow websites like [Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a19663621/best-running-shoes/ \"open in a new window\") or [Sole Review](https://zdcs.link/jkOGv?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sole%20Review&short_url=jkOGv&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") to check out which models are being updated and when they are scheduled to launch. But an even simpler way to keep up on shoe seasons is just to check the \"new arrivals\" section on your local running store's website, or sign up for their newsletter.\nFor example, since that Asics Gel Nimbus 27 was released this year at $165, you can bet that the [Asics Gel Nimbus 26](https://zdcs.link/vdG4W?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Asics%20Gel%20Nimbus%2026&short_url=vdG4W&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is available much more cheaply. At the time of this writing, most of the color/size combinations are going for around $110--that's more than a 30% discount. \n[ ASICS Women's Gel-Nimbus 26  $109.95 at Amazon $159.95 Save $50.00 Get Deal  Get Deal  $109.95 at Amazon $159.95 Save $50.00 ](https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASICS-Womens-Gel-Nimbus-Running-Celadon%2Fdp%2FB0CN7ZC26T%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0CN7ZC26T%3Fmcid%3D928fe28360563bb28da32f064cda77b6%26hvocijid%3D11879640041577951929-B0CN7ZC26T-%26hvexpln%3D73%26tag%3Dhyprod-20%26linkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D721245378154%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D11879640041577951929%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D9198314%26hvtargid%3Dpla-2281435177658%26psc%3D1&template=Opinions&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&position=1&element_label=ASICS+Women%27s+Gel-Nimbus+26&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&product_uuid=06DQayM8zTU7gBh2ehiYqOz&offer_uuid=07FY2FAfFmQ921aXPlEo3br&pageview_type=RSS&object_type=07FY2FAfFmQ921aXPlEo3br&object_uuid=06DQayM8zTU7gBh2ehiYqOz&data-aps-asin=B0CN7ZC26T&data-aps-asc-tag=lifehack088-20&data-aps-asc-subtag=07FY2FAfFmQ921aXPlEo3br \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")\n[ ASICS Men's Gel-Nimbus 26  $109.95 at Amazon $160.00 Save $50.05 Get Deal  Get Deal  $109.95 at Amazon $160.00 Save $50.05 ](https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASICS-Gel-Nimbus-Running-Black-Graphite%2Fdp%2FB0CFNLCPH4%2Fref%3Dsr_1_5%3Fcrid%3DPM4EZL8VCHZB%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UkXHuDDWQaViRrbF0V0qgfzfzs4yRhIIsgcNmkWe_u_fWk0CZFNZvuTYRXBkLkv-FiHxOniPQ-zS3aF2kNXFiNTibJBuaBS9nKze0dPv_eslZEWnbjBJAQBk1O6ebgGR4e_PbsKrIv1ufrAMS9MhHoIpOmecAitAjlVvodaHB9YV6H18wioNISBYPILrdkBT8XaVkxEn0watYqmjldAmSOAdrm4pmXn2dPFARs9By1uduUNmm9CckSUsVrG1Q1qux_x5sISNePIy14gCgeMbojyxqDavqGRDtgIth9WCMA8.KJ0TueuHZiLDifPkDQof-e4lq4dX8c2-c0y3OqiBSeQ%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dasics%2Bgel%2Bnimbus%2Bmens%26qid%3D1746724708%26sprefix%3Dasics%2Bgel%2Bnimbus%2Bmens%252Caps%252C95%26sr%3D8-5&template=Opinions&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&position=1&element_label=ASICS+Men%27s+Gel-Nimbus+26&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&product_uuid=01UjT63OWh6ASV4fzN581cx&offer_uuid=00lPuxivHlbshUDpRX38Kb1&pageview_type=RSS&object_type=00lPuxivHlbshUDpRX38Kb1&object_uuid=01UjT63OWh6ASV4fzN581cx&data-aps-asin=B0CFNLCPH4&data-aps-asc-tag=lifehack088-20&data-aps-asc-subtag=00lPuxivHlbshUDpRX38Kb1 \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")\nThat's a pretty typical bargain, but you can do even better if you shop around--and if you don't mind choosing your shoes based on the cheapest price rather than the prettiest colors. \nThat issue of selection is a good reason to shop now rather than waiting. As the summer wears on, you may find deeper discounts on last year's model, but you'll also have fewer options. Sizes sell out, too. Here's a perfect example: the Asics Gel Nimbus 25 (that's _two_ models back) is going for [just $99.95](https://zdcs.link/zJgq6e?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=just%20%2499.95&short_url=zJgq6e&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\").

\"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")\n## But beware shoes that are _too_ old\nIf you're going to shop discontinued models, there are a few pitfalls you should know about. One is that the foam in a pair of shoes [will degrade while it sits on the shelf](https://lifehacker.com/why-older-running-shoes-probably-wont-last-even-if-the-1847417213). This isn't a problem if you're buying a model that was _just_ discontinued--those should be fine. But if you find shoes that are two or three model numbers back, they probably won't last as long as new ones. (The price might still make them worthwhile even with the shortened lifespan, but consider yourself warned.) \nThe same concern applies if you're buying last year's model as a backup and planning to stash it in your closet until your current shoes break down. Consider how long it will be until you actually use the shoes, and decide accordingly. While you're at it, apply the same logic to any gently-used shoes you might find on [eBay](https://zdcs.link/xmD7Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eBay&short_url=xmD7Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") or [Poshmark](https://zdcs.link/73eb4?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Poshmark&short_url=73eb4&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\").",

    "title": "Everything I'm Seeding in May",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "While a lot of May gardening is dedicated to moving plants into the ground, there is still plenty of seeding to be done. Inside, I'm starting late-planted vegetables like cucumbers, and a second round of annual flowers, like stock and celosia. Outside, I'm beginning to direct seed vegetables like corn and beans, and annuals like sunflowers. It's important to remember to stay on top of your succession planting during this busy time. And finally, there's no better time to start, reseed, or overseed your eco lawn. \n## Lawns\nA clover lawn before being cut Credit: Amanda Blum\nTake advantage of the last of the rains to help germinate your [eco lawn](https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-grow-eco-lawn) or clover lawn. You don't have to convert your whole yard, either, if you're anxious about it. Carve out a smaller area to seed with clover to try it. Ideally, you're not creating a monoculture of one kind of seed, so other low lying flowers can be added in like yarrow, English daisy, and multiple types of clover. I add traditional clover for winter coverage, and red and strawberry clover for the summer to get pops of color. \n## Annual flowers\nIn most parts of the U.S., you'll start to get enough sunshine this month to direct seed outside, which just means you'll plant the seeds in the soil, rather than try to grow seedlings inside to plant outside later. If you're going to try to direct-seed [annuals](https://lifehacker.com/home/these-annual-flowers-can-reseed-themselves) like wildflowers, they can start going in the ground as soon as you've reasonably passed the risk of frost. Pay attention to the packet for instructions as to the depth of seeds--many seeds cannot germinate by simply being sprinkled on top of the soil; they need cover of soil. Your sunflower seeds, for instance, need a depth of an inch or so. A good basic rule is that seeds need to be planted as deep as their size. So tiny seeds like celosia are ok to be sowed on the surface, but marigolds and zinnia must be planted about half an inch deep. If you want to scatter the seeds to get a more natural look rather than poke holes for the seeds, scratch up an area so there's soil contact for the seeds, then scatter them and cover them by sprinkling soil on top and patting it down. Finish by watering. \nI plant a row of sunflowers on the edge of my garden every year.  Credit: Amanda Blum\nRemember that summer is finite, so if you haven't planted annual flower starts and you want to direct seed, you'll want to do so before the end of May--although you may succession-seed another round of flowers later this summer, like zinnias or sunflowers. Consider ideas like a [flower wall](https://lifehacker.com/you-can-build-a-stunning-flower-wall-for-your-home-1850439853), or a row of sunflowers at the edge of the property or garden to define the area. \n## Direct sown vegetables\nWhile some people direct sow vegetables like tomatoes and peppers outside, for most of the U.S., the summer is simply too short to do so and get a reasonable yield of fruit. This is why people buy vegetable starts at the nursery. Some vegetables, though, are fast-growing and prefer not to have their roots disturbed, so seeding them in the garden is a fine idea, and now is the time to do so. \nThere's almost no reason to start beans inside; they grow quickly and have shallow roots, so they are best seeded outside. Remember that beans are either bush type or vine type, and both need [support](https://lifehacker.com/trellises-will-completely-transform-your-garden-1850422342), but vining beans can grow ten to twelve feet tall: Strong support will be needed, as beans can easily pull a trellis down. \nCucumbers on a frame trellis Credit: Amanda Blum\nCucumbers are ideal to start outside, particularly cucamelons (Mexican sour gherkins, which have become quite popular the last few years). They germinate within a few weeks and prefer not to have their roots disturbed. You can succession plant your cucumbers, so put another round of seeds in the ground in a few weeks. Cucumbers can crawl on the dirt, but you'll get better use of space and cleaner cucumbers if you use a trellis designed for them. \nwhen pumpkins are grown on trellises, you make slings for them to add support Credit: Amanda Blum\nPumpkins and squash are fine to seed in the dirt. Pumpkins benefit from a hilling process. A popular way to do this is to dump a bucket or two of compost into a pile, creating a hill, and then place two or three pumpkin seeds in each hill. If these are giant pumpkins, you'll thin the seedlings to one, but for regular size pumpkins, you can have two seedlings. I've also had tremendous success growing pie pumpkins or mini pumpkins on an arch, so the pumpkins hang down. I'll be doing that again this summer with black and white pumpkins. \nMost squash will germinate quickly, and while you can pick up summer squash and zucchini starts, you have plenty of time to grow from seed in most climates. Give it a try this summer. \nCorn should be grown in blocks for better pollination.  Credit: Amanda Blum\nCorn should always be direct seeded. It is easy to germinate, and it grows fast. Make sure you're planting corn in blocks of four by four feet, so there's enough corn to pollinate itself. Corn grows tassels, which are[ pollinated](https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-get-best-fruit-production-from-plants-trees) by the wind, so unless you have a big enough block of corn stalks, you won't get corn. Don't try to grow a short row or a few plants; you need a substantial block of plants. \nMelons are similar to squash and cucumbers and can be direct sown outside--but remember that melons and those cucurbits can cross pollinate, so don't plant them close together or you'll end up with Franken-squash, a common garden occurrence. \n## Succession seeding\nBe sure to take advantage of the last spring rain to germinate additional rounds of carrots. Since they need constant moisture during germination, the rain can carry the load here. This time of year, I leave the radish, lettuce, green onion, beet, and kohlrabi seeds outside in a protected spot so I'll remember to seed them once a week. You don't need to put out a packet's worth each week, just the number that you'll eat. It helps to mark rows as you go so you don't plant in a spot you've already seeded. \nlettuce grown in troughs Credit: Amanda Blum\nMy favorite tip for having a summers' worth of lettuce is to direct seed a long, low trough planter of lettuce, but you can just pick a corner of a planting bed. Dump the whole packet of seeds in and be sure to mix it with the top layer of soil so it's distributed evenly. Water the area and as the seeds germinate, you'll have a planter packed with lettuce. But if it's _too_ packed, it won't grow much, so each week, I grab a scoop from the end of the planter, separate those seedlings, and plant them out in the garden beds. The planter acts as a holding space for lettuce most of the summer, and each week I pluck out a few to plant. \n## Seeding inside\nThere are still seedlings I grow inside this time of year, despite the abundant sunshine because growing inside means less exposure to predators like squirrels, birds, and rabbits, and I can control the atmosphere. If it's a particularly bad year for slugs, for instance, I may choose to grow cucumbers inside as starts. Sometimes I grow them in both locations so I can sub a start in if a cucumber plant gets eaten. \nI also grow a second round of flowers inside, like stock and celosia. These are delicate seeds that benefit from a lot of attention, so I find growing them inside in a controlled environment is easier. Then I can place the grown starts precisely where I want them.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "In an ideal world, you'd lead a long and happy life only ever shutting down and restarting your PC via the Start menu. Click the power icon, choose your option, and you're done. However, life doesn't always work out like we plan it, and sometimes you may need to trigger a restart or shutdown from the command prompt instead.\nMaybe something is stopping the Start menu from working, or perhaps you find yourself on a screen where the Start menu isn't available. One of the scenarios where I use the command prompt to shut down Windows is when I'm in the initial setup phase for the operating system and don't want to complete it right away.\nThe shutdown command can turn off your PC on a timer. Credit: Lifehacker\nYou might also have loaded the command prompt interface to try and troubleshoot a problem that's stopping Windows from working--in which case you need to know how to power off or reboot your computer without pressing and holding the power button. (If you are having PC issues, see also [this lesser-known emergency restart option](https://lifehacker.com/tech/windows-has-an-emergency-restart-option-you-probably-dont-know-about).)\n## Using the command prompt\nIf you're completely new to the command prompt, it's the text-based interface hidden away in Windows, a remnant of the old days before computer operating systems had pointers and graphical user interfaces, and still useful for running a variety of low-level system operations.\nPowerShell doesn't look too different to the command prompt at first glance. Credit: Lifehacker\nThe command prompt is also accompanied by PowerShell, which is a more modern and feature-rich version of this interface. As far as these shutdown and restart commands are concerned, you can use either for the job, but if you ever need to run more advanced text commands, scripts, and automations, PowerShell is better set up to accommodate them.\nYou can launch either the command prompt or PowerShell from the Start menu: Just type the first few letters of either utility into the search box at the top to find them. There are various other options too, like right-clicking on the Start menu button and choosing **Terminal** , or by typing \"cmd\" into the search box on the taskbar and hitting **Enter**.\n## Using the \"shutdown\" command \nThe text command you need to either shut down or restart your Windows computer is 'shutdown'. If you type it into the command prompt or PowerShell and then hit **Enter** , you'll get a full description of shutdown, and all the ways you can use it (by the way, you can add \"| more\" to this or any command to see a page of text at a time).\n### Type \"shutdown /s\" to trigger a standard shutdown\nThe most basic flags you'll need are \"shutdown /s\" and \"shutdown /r\" to power off and restart your computer, respectively. In both cases you'll see a dialog box on screen telling you what's happening, and the action is taken in less than a minute. These commands will initiate a normal shutdown process, so you'll be prompted to save any unsaved work in your open programs that usually do that.\nThis will restart Windows and launch the advanced boot options screen. Credit: Lifehacker\n### Type \"shutdown /s /f\" to force a shutdown\nTo force all apps to close without any further prompting--perhaps if you need to make sure the shutdown or restart goes through without a hitch--add the \"/f\" to the end of your command (so, either \"shutdown /s /f\" for a shutdown or \"shutdown /r /f\" for a restart). You do this at your own risk though, with the risk of losing data that hasn't already been saved, and it's probably best left as a last resort.\n### Type \"shutdown /r /o\" to access advanced boot options\nFor troubleshooting purposes, the \"shutdown /r /o\" command is useful because it reboots your computer into the advanced boot options screen. That's the one that gives you access to features such as using a USB drive to recover your PC, running the built-in start-up repair utility, and rolling back recent updates to Windows. You can also get back to the command prompt from here without starting the operating system.\nThe shutdown command can also be used to stop a shutdown. Credit: Lifehacker\n### Time your shutdown by adding \"/t\"\nAnother flag that can be useful is the \"/t\" flag followed by a space and a number. This puts the shutdown or the restart on a delay, giving you time to close apps or finish downloads. The number is the number of seconds Windows should wait, and it can go from 0 (instant) all the way up to 315360000--that's 10 years, if you were wondering. If the seconds are set to anything above zero, the \"/f\" flag is also applied.\n### Stop a shutdown with \"shutdown /a\"\nOne final one that you might find helpful: You can use \"shutdown /a\" to abort a shutdown that's currently underway (perhaps one that you've set on a timer). For a full rundown of all the ways you can use this command, including some advanced options for IT managers (such as remote shutdowns), check out [the official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/shutdown \"open in a new window\").",

All are considered high severity. May's patch also addresses vulnerabilities with Qualcomm, MediaTek, Arm, and Imagination Technologies components.\n## One active exploit\nThe zero-day addressed with the latest update is a remote code execution flaw labeled CVE-2025-27363. It impacts FreeType, an open-source font rendering library, and allows attackers to exploit how the program processes certain files. The bug affects FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below and [was first reported by security researchers at Facebook](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-actively-exploited-freetype-flaw-on-android/ \"open in a new window\") in March 2025, though details as to how it has been exploited have not been disclosed. \n## What Android users need to do\nIf you have an Android device, you should get a notification to install the latest security update as soon as it's available. Google pushes patches to Pixel phones and the core Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code, while other device manufacturers--Samsung, Motorola, and Nokia--typically issue updates around the same time. \nThis month's patches apply to AOSP versions 13, 14, and 15, with separate updates dated 2025-05-01 and 2025-05-05 (the latter addresses all of the flaws identified). Note that Google [ended support for Android 12](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-ending-support-for-android-12) as of March 31, meaning devices running this and older versions won't receive security updates even though they may be affected by some of the vulnerabilities. \nIf you're not sure whether your device has been patched, check for available updates via **Settings > Security & privacy > System & updates > Security update** and follow the prompts to download and install.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nAfter more than a week of teasing it on social media, [_Whoop_](https://zdcs.link/9l3M3R?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Whoop&short_url=9l3M3R&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") has finally announced the release of its 5.0 device, along with a version called the \"MG\" (medical grade) that can do ECG readings and estimate blood pressure. Members can upgrade for a $49 fee or by extending their membership in one of the three new membership tiers: One ($199/year), Peak ($239/year, similar to current offerings) or Life ($359/year). \nWhoop is the screenless fitness tracker that [_earned four stars in my review of the 4.0 model_](https://lifehacker.com/health/whoop-40-review) for its integrated fitness and recovery tracking and its handling of strength training. It's only available by subscription, with the hardware being sort of a bonus that comes with membership. That means upgrades to the hardware are handled a bit differently than for a device you outright purchase; more on that below. \n## What's in the Whoop 5.0\nThe 5.0 device looks a lot like the 4.0, but Whoop calculates that it is 7% smaller. This change means that straps and other accessories from the 4.0 won't fit the new device. (Longstanding members with more than 1,500 recoveries will receive a \"Milestone collection\" box with extra bands.) \nThe 5.0 has a 14-day battery life, the company says, more than double that of the 4.0. There is also a new power pack (the battery that you slide on to charge the device while you wear it). Only members of the Peak and Life tiers will get the wireless power pack; the lowest tier membership comes with a wired charger. \nOtherwise, the 5.0 hardware is similar to the previous edition, but with internal upgrades--a 60% faster processor, the company says, and \"enhanced sensors.\" \n## The difference between the 5.0 and MG\nThe MG (\"medical grade\") Whoop device adds the ability to take an ECG from your wrist, in much the same way as an Apple Watch or Fitbit (you'll touch metal contacts with the fingers of your other hand while wearing it). \nThe MG device comes with a Whoop Life membership, the most expensive tier at $359/year. \n## What you get with each of the three membership tiers\nThe three new membership tiers are One ($199/year), Peak ($239/year), and Life ($359/year). One is a stripped-down membrership, Peak is similar to what Whoop users have right now, and Life is a new offering with extra health features. Here's the breakdown: \n### Whoop One ($199/year)\n[_One_](https://zdcs.link/92xP15?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=One&short_url=92xP15&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is the budget membership. You get a wired charger instead of the wireless power pack, and a \"CoreKnit\" band, which seems to be a new material that isn't as nice as the SuperKnit bands offered with the higher tiers.\nIf you downgrade to this level, you'll lose a few features that Whoop members currently all get: the Health Monitor (with its readings of HRV, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and skin temperature) or the Stress Monitor, which tells you in real time how much stress you seem to be under.\n### Whoop Peak ($239/year)\nPeak is the most similar to the single subscription level that was offered with the 4.0, both in price and features. If your subscription renews without you choosing a tier, you'll end up on Peak. \nYou'll also get the new Healthspan feature that tells you your \"Whoop age\" and your \"pace of aging,\" and gives recommendations to improve those metrics. \n### Whoop Life ($359/year)\n[_Life_](https://zdcs.link/QObXgE?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Life&short_url=QObXgE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is the top tier membership, and comes with the MG rather than 5.0 hardware. It includes everything in Peak, including the Healthspan feature. \nWith the MG you'll be able to take ECG readings, and Whoop is also introducing a feature (currently in beta) to estimate your blood pressure. You'll need to calibrate it with readings from a blood pressure cuff to start using it. \n## How upgrades to the Whoop 5.0 or MG will work\nIf you're currently a Whoop member, and were looking forward to upgrading your hardware for free (as the [_Whoop FAQ states_](https://www.whoop.com/eu/en/thelocker/your-top-questions-answered/ \"open in a new window\")), here's the fine print. \nWhoop tells me that members _who pay for another 12 months of membership_ will get the 5.0 (or MG) hardware for free. So if you're six months into your current membership, you can buy a 12-month extension, thus having 18 months left on your membership, and get a new device. \nIf you don't want to extend your membership, you can opt to pay a $49 upgrade fee to get the 5.0 device to use on your current membership term. \nWhoop says that when you upgrade, they'll send you a \"gift kit\" that you can use to pass along your old 4.0 device to a friend. It includes a sanitizing wipe and a fresh SuperKnit band. \n## What if I don't upgrade? \nWhoop memberships will still work with the 4.0 device, and you'll still get access to everything the Peak membership offers, including the new Healthspan feature (coming soon to 4.0). If your membership renews without you choosing a tier, you'll be rolled into the Peak membership. \n_Updated 5/8/2025 at 3:30 p.m. to note that the age metric is called \"Whoop age\" and not \"fitness age.\" Updated 5/9/2025 at 10 a.m. to note that Healthspan is currently available on 5.0 and coming soon to 4.0._",

    "title": "What's the Difference Between LED and Mini-LED?",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "The alphabet soup of TV terminology is overwhelming enough, but you might have seen a particularly confusing term pop up lately: mini-LED. LEDs are already tiny, so what exactly could the \"mini\" here even mean? It turns out, quite a lot, and that distinction can mean the difference between washed out colors and a more vivid display.\nThe thing is, almost every TV you see is technically _some_ kind of LED display. Most use bright white LEDs as a backlight, which shines through an LCD matrix and color filter to produce a coherent image. ([The exception is OLED](https://lifehacker.com/tech/oled-vs-qled-differences), which lights up each pixel individually and thus doesn't require a backlight.)\nMini-LEDs are an improvement over the backlight part of that process. Traditionally, the backlight on most LCD TVs have been either uniform or only divided into a few sub-zones. Mini-LEDs are much smaller back lights that can be individually controlled, allowing your TV to be bright in spots where it needs to be bright, and dark where it needs to be dark.\n## How do LED displays work?\nBefore we get to mini-LEDs, let's break down how most LCD displays work a little further. When manufacturers advertise a display as an \"LED TV,\" this is usually referring to the backlight and, well, LED is kind of a given there. However, there are a couple different types of backlights:\n  * **Edge-lit backlighting:** In this arrangement, LEDs are placed in an array along the outside edge of the screen, which then shine through light guides that more evenly distribute the light across the display. This can be more cost-effective, but it can sometimes lead to light bleed around the edges, or duller areas in the middle of the screen.\n  * **Full array backlighting:** Alternatively, some manufacturers will create a grid of LEDs that fill the area of the display. This leads to more even lighting across the picture. More importantly, those LEDs can usually be controlled individually, allowing for local dimming (more on that below).\n\n\nThese backlights shine white light (or blue, in the case of [_quantum dot displays_](https://lifehacker.com/tech/oled-vs-qled-differences)) that is then dimmed or blocked by an LCD matrix. This layer uses tiny liquid crystals to block or allow light to pass through, which then passes through either a red, green, or blue filter. By controlling how much light goes through each of these filters (or \"subpixels\"), the TV can control what color each pixel will be.\nThere's just one tiny problem with this: LCDs can't perfectly block all of the light that the backlight emits. This is why, even when your LCD screen is displaying all black, it still looks \"on.\" Some light is always making its way through. In order to achieve darker blacks, you need another technique.\n## How does local dimming work?\n\"Local dimming\" refers to a range of techniques for LED-backed displays that essentially boils down to the same thing: dimming or disabling backlights where you don't need them. This means less light bleeding through, resulting in darker black levels, and more contrast with the brighter parts of the screen.\nThe only hitch is, there are quite literally millions more pixels in an LCD display than there are individual backlights. Fewer backlights means less resolution to distinguish between bright and dark zones. It also means you can get what's called a \"bloom effect\" when a bright object seems to glow more than it should. This is caused when the backlight bleeds through in the dark pixels around a bright object.\nEvery backlight creates a dimming \"zone\" and [_the more zones you have the better_](https://youtu.be/mPyqLGwl0aY?si=H-rR6LZOTPPoyZ2D&t=66 \"open in a new window\"). For most LED-lit TVs, this can range from a couple dozen to a few hundred. However, mini-LED tech allows TVs to crank that number up to the thousands.\n## What makes mini-LED displays different?\nPut simply, in a mini-LED display, the LEDs are, well, mini. That's it. To be more specific, the term is defined as any display where the backlight LED diodes are no larger than 0.2 mm. They can be smaller than that, but any larger and they can't (or at least _shouldn't_) be called \"mini-LED\" anymore.\nWhen they're packed that small, you can fit a _lot_ more LEDs into the same space. This [_Sony 65-inch Bravia Mini-LED TV_](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-65-class-bravia-9-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2024/6578568.p \"open in a new window\"), for example, has over 1,500 local dimming zones. That means that each LED backlight only has to light up a little over one square inch. This provides a lot more flexibility to create contrast between the light and dark parts of the image.\n## Why would you want mini-LED over OLED?\nIt does seem a little weird, right? OLED displays light up every single pixel individually, so you're only using the pixels you need. Why this rigmarole with a local dimming array? In part, it's because OLED displays have a higher susceptibility to burn in. \nThe organic LED elements can degrade in ways that leave ghosting of images that are frequently on screen, such as menus, taskbars, or lower-thirds. This isn't an issue for typical LED-lit displays, where the LCD layer is made of sturdier, inorganic materials.\nLED and mini-LED panels can also get a lot brighter than OLED displays. This makes them better suited for TVs that might sit in your living room, near a lot of sunny windows. While OLED TVs exist and they're great, they can struggle to compete with the light in bright rooms, making them better suited to night-time viewing or dimly lit rooms.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "For some, spooky season begins sometime in late August--when Target puts out the animatronic skeletons and ghost projectors, and when every vacant retail space is possessed by a Spirit Halloween. For others, it's after Labor Day. For yet another subset, spooky season runs year-round. A quick check of the calendar reveals that at least one of those criteria have been met, which means it's time to queue up something with chilling vibes--even if the sun is shining.\n## _Talk to Me_ (2022)\nA group of teens comes across an embalmed hand and realize that they can use it to conjure spirits, which is all tremendous fun until it most assuredly isn't. While there are elements of \"elevated\" horror here in the film's suggestion that grief and trauma are pretty much the real gateways to hell, _Talk to Me_ is also packed with old-school thrills and a general freakiness that we love to see. **You can stream Talk to Me[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81700507 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Psycho_ (1960)\nWhat could possibly be scary about sweet Norman Bates, a boy whose best friend is, after all, his mother? Alfred Hitchcock's film shocked audiences back in 1960, and still stands as a high-water mark in slasher cinema, with masterful twists and shifts in perspective that keep _Psycho_ thrilling even after decades and endless imitators. Anthony Perkins makes you kinda cheer for Norman, even after you're wise to the movie's climactic reveal. **You can stream _Psycho_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/879522 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _I Know What You Did Last Summer_ (1997)\nOf the many (many, many) _Scream_ imitators that came out post-1996, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_ was the most effective (it was also written by Kevin Williamson), and has proven to be the one with the most staying power--the original sequels were not so much, but there's a fair bit of anticipation around a new movie coming this summer. With the '90s super-group cast of Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr., _Last Summer_ gets off on the right foot with a smart, simple premise: a group of kids accidentally hit someone while driving their car, but, as suggested by the title, they're unable to put that event behind them. **You can stream _Last Summer_ h[ere](https://www.netflix.com/title/1181714 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Scream VI_ (2023)\nWhile the venerable franchise's future is looking increasingly rocky (the upcoming sequel lost several actors, a director, and a lot of good will on its way to theaters), _Scream_ came back in a big way in 2022 with a wildly successful sequel/reboot from Radio Silence. _Scream VI_ moves the action out of small-town Woodsboro, California for the first time, sending our previous film's survivors off to New York City, and without decades-long-lead Neve Campbell. No worries, though: Ghostface is as brutal and funny as ever in a film full of impressive set pieces and with a central mystery that's as well-constructed as any in the series (meaning that it _mostly_ makes sense). The big finale is probably the most elaborate of the series. **You can stream _Scream VI_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81639205 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Train to Busan_ (2016) \nBefore _Parasite_ , Yeon Sang-ho's film was, perhaps, the biggest South Korean film to break into the American market, even if some of the subtext gets lost stateside (Busan was a haven for refugees during the Korean War). The 2016 film follows Seok-woo, a workaholic divorced dad who comes to feel that he's running out of time to be the father he ought to be for his daughter Su-an. He has _no_ idea how right he is. The train trip he plans for them as bonding time becomes something much more desperate when a zombie-infected woman hops aboard just before departure. What follows is one of the best action-horror movies of the past decade, but also a surprisingly moving story about a father and daughter reconnecting at the end of the world, as well as one that doesn't shy away from some pretty pointed critiques of modern capitalism. **You can stream _Train to Busan_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117824 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Compliance_ (2012)\nNo need for zombies, demons, or ghosts here: just plain old humans being horrifying without any supernatural help. And this one's based on a true story, replacing a real-life McDonalds with the fictional \"ChickWich.\" Becky (Dreama Walker) is working her shift at the fast-food restaurant when she's called into the office--it seems that an \"Officer Daniels\" (Pat Healy) is on the phone, and that Becky matches the description of a woman the police are looking for regarding a series of thefts. Manager Sandra (Ann Dowd) first questions Becky and then, under instructions from the man on the phone, strip searches the young woman. Things get far worse from there. **You can stream Compliance[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/70229062 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Deliverance_ (2024)\nAny cheapo movie can be weird, but with big name talent, a weird movie can really enter the cultural conversation--to whit, _The Deliverance_ is helmed by _Precious_ /_The Butler_ director Lee Daniels, and stars Andra Day, Glenn Close, Mo'Nique, and Omar Epps. And the discourse here? It's mostly centered around the age-old question: What the fuck did I just watch? Based on a true story (which: sure), it stars Day as a struggling single mom with a prison record who is raising three kids by herself while paying for cancer treatments for her mom (Glenn Close). It hits many typical exorcism-movie beats, but by the time you get to EGOT nominee Close sprouting fangs and screaming about what body parts she can smell from across the room, it's clear we've been in high-camp territory all along. **You can stream _The Deliverance_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81582382 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Under Paris_ (2024)\nYou might want to rethink those Paris travel plans after this one. This is an aggressively fun (and very French) update on _Jaws_ that sees a killer mako shark loose, first in the Seine and later in the famous catacombs. An Olympic qualifying event is about to occur in the city, which, of course, the mayor won't call off in spite of the growing body count. There's some stuff here about environmental catastrophe being the cause, but mostly it's just a bone-chomping good time. **You can stream _Under Paris_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81210788 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Thanksgiving_ (2023) \nEli Roth dropped his first straight-up horror movie since 2013's _The Green Inferno_ in this funny but bleak satire. When an unruly mob storms a Walmart (ahem: \"RightMart\") on Black Friday, violence and bloodshed ensue, leading one of the victims of the incident to seek revenge. Patrick Dempsey stars in this bit of wild and gory holiday fun. **You can stream _Thanksgiving_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81753224 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Blood Red Sky_ (2021)\nGerman widow Nadja is taking a flight to New York with her kid, Elias. She seems sick--we and her fellow passengers are meant to think that she has cancer, which makes her an easy mark for the terrorist hijackers who board the plane and shoot her out of pique. Big mistake. The vampires-on-a-plane high concept at work could have been silly, but at no point does the movie forget that we're seated for gory bloodsucking action. **You can stream _Blood Red Sky_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80198645 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Nightbooks_ (2021)\nSo, _Nightbooks_ is technically for kids, and therefore might not provide quite the volume of scares that a grown-up horror audience might be hoping for. That being said: There are some legit frights here, frankly a little beyond what you'd expect from a kids' movie. It's the old story of kids kidnapped by a witch (Krysten Ritter), with the added twist that one of the kidnapped, Alex (Winslow Fegley) writes scary stories, and has to tell one each night that he's trapped in the witch's apartment in order to stay alive. There's imagery here to creep out just about anybody. **You can stream _Nightbooks_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81002270 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Bone Tomahawk_ (2015)\nWhat's that? You want even more Patrick Wilson in your horror movies? He joins this modern cult classic, led by Kurt Russell as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, in charge of a posse to rescue a young woman from a group of inbred cannibals in the old west. The \"Weird\" Western, in which we encounter ghosts, aliens, or, in this case, cannibals in the old west, is a venerable genre in literature, but rarely if ever done so well on the screen. This is old west horror done right. **You can stream _Bone Tomahawk_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80075001 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Apostle_ (2018)\nIf you're familiar with the wild tower action spectacle _The Raid_ , you might have some sense of the energy that director Gareth Evans brings to _Apostle 's_ second half, even if the styles are very different. This one's pure folk horror, with nods to _The Wicker Man_ : Dan Stevens (_Downton Abbey_ , _The Guest_) plays Thomas Richardson, a now-faithless missionary who returns home to discover that his sister has been kidnapped by a religious cult on a remote Welsh island. What starts out feeling a bit like a sleepy period drama evolves into a truly wild gorefest before it's done. **You can stream _Apostle_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80158148 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _His House_ (2020)\nAs fraught (and snooty) as the _term_ \"elevated horror\" has become, it's good to remember that a movie can have deep emotional resonance and a social conscience, all without sacrificing the haunted-house chills. Here, Bol and Rial (Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku), with their daughter Nyagak, flee war-torn Sudan to find refuge in a quiet English town, only to find that there's evil waiting there for them. **You can stream _His House_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81231197 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Gerald 's Game_ (2017)\n_Gerald 's Game_, from the 1992 Stephen King novel, never seemed terribly filmable. The story is set entirely in an isolated cabin in the woods, and involves a single immobilized character for much of its page count. Enter director Mike Flanagan--who, in addition to his successful miniseries projects (_The Haunting of Hill House_ , _Midnight Mass_ , _The Midnight Club_), did the impossible in crafting a killer adaptation of King's lesser-loved Shining sequel, _Doctor Sleep_. Carla Gugino stars as a married woman trapped when her husband, played by Bruce Greenwood, dies after having handcuffed her to the bed. Increasingly delirious, she's forced to face not only her past trauma, but the hungry dog that keeps sniffing around. **You can stream _Gerald 's Game_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80128722 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Creep_ (2014)\nOne of the better (maybe one of the best) found footage-style films of recent years, _Creep_ takes place within the camera of Aaron (Patrick Brice, who also directed) and stars Mark Duplass (_The Morning Show_) as a dying man who hires the videographer to document his final days for his unborn son. The movie builds its tension around, initially, Aaron's excessive friendliness--there are few better ways to create an atmosphere of unease than by offering up a character who's a little too nice. Before long, the guy's effusiveness curdles into an unpredictability that gets, well, creepier and creepier. **You can stream _Creep_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/70306646 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Platform_ (2019)\nThe metaphor might seem a little heavy-handed--but modern life has begun to teach us that even the direst of dystopian sci-fi is just around the corner. The titular platform is a large tower, euphemistically referred to as the \"Vertical Self-Management Center,\" in which food is delivered via a shaft that stops on each floor from the top down: those near the top get to eat their fill; those at the bottom get scraps. The Spanish-language thriller is wildly violent, but inventive, and it's not as if real-life capitalism is particularly subtle in its deprivations. **You can stream _The Platform_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81128579 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Under the Shadow_ (2016)\nIn Tehran during the Iran-Iraq War, a woman estranged from her husband is forced to protect her child from mysterious supernatural forces as the bombs continue to fall. Writer/director Babak Anvari's _Under the Shadow_ invokes the jinn (neither necessarily good nor evil, but potentially threatening) as a way to talk about the strife and turmoil of war and political conflict, as well as about the anxieties of women in oppressive societies. The atmospheric film plays simultaneously as the story of a haunting, and also as one about women and civilians in times of war; each element serves to heighten the other. **You can stream _Under the Shadow_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80096786 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Call_ (2020)\nI love a time-travel horror movie (a tiny but venerable genre that includes movies like _Timecrimes_ , _Triangle_ , and _Happy Death Day_). This one involves Seo-yeon (Park Shin-hye) visiting her childhood home in 2019, only to discover that an old cordless phone still works (never a good sign), and connects her to Young-sook (Jeon Jong-seo), living in the house in 1999. The two bond over shared experiences, but things soon go very wrong when Seo-Yeon tells the other young woman about the future, and influences her to make changes. Some events, it seems, are best left alone. Clever and disturbing, with a solid high concept. **You can stream _The Call_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81342505 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Cam_ (2018)\nDirector Daniel Goldhaber (the upcoming _How to Blow Up a Pipeline_) teamed up with writer Isa Mazzei, who based this Black Mirror-esque story partly on her own memoir. Madeline Brewer (_Orange is the New Black_) plays online sex worker Alice Ackerman, aka Lola_Lola, who one night discovers there's another Lola out there--a cam girl who's identical to Alice in appearance and general vibe, but whose willingness to go further puts her out in front in terms of viewership. It's a horror movie with a lot to say about the dehumanization of sex workers, with a great central performance from Brewer. **You can stream _Cam_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80177400 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House_ (2016)\nGirl, yeah you are! A brisk, chilling, and effective gothic horror film starring Ruth Wilson as a live-in nurse who comes to believe that the creaky old house where she works is haunted. This one's less concerned with immediate shocks and scares than with getting under your skin, but there's definitely a creepiness here that lingers. Director Osgood Perkins had similar success with _The Blackcoat 's Daughter_ and _Gretel & Hansel_. **You can stream _I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80094648 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Block Island Sound_ (2020)\nStrange doings are afoot on the title's Block Island, the most obvious being the vast numbers of dead fish that keep washing ashore. Almost as alarming, though, is the behavior of one of the local fishermen, Tom, who keeps waking up in strange places and generally losing time. His daughter Audry (Michaela McManus) works for the Environmental Protection Agency and is sent to investigate the mass fish deaths; she brings along her daughter and reunites with brother Tom (Chris Sheffield) along the way. Together, they discover that no ordinary environmental catastrophe is to blame (I guess it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if it were), as the film blends family drama and the eerie local events as it builds to a pretty chilling climax. **You can stream _Block Island Sound_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81354464 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Cargo_ (2017)\nWith the always-welcome Martin Freeman in the lead, this is, OK, yet another zombie film, but one that still manages to do things a bit differently. An Australian import, this one tweaks the rules so that the infected have just about 48 hours of humanity before they turn, meaning that everyone has a bit of time to contemplate their fates, and maybe even to think about how to make the best use of their time. It's a more melancholic take on the zombie apocalypse, full of chilling outback atmosphere and some genuine scares. Don't get confused with the 2020 sci-fi movie of the same name, also on Netflix. **You can stream _Cargo_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80161216 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Ouija: Origin of Evil_ (2016)\nWe heard you like movies about toys? (Hey _Barbie_!) Hasbro brings you this sequel to the fairly by-the-numbers 2014 movie based on the company's \"let's pretend to talk to the dead\" board game. But there's a shocking twist: This one's actually good, or certainly better than it has any right to be, which probably has something to do with the involvement of co-writer and director Mike Flanagan (_Doctor Sleep_ , The _Haunting of Hill House_ , etc.), who treats this like an actual movie rather than a bit of tie-in marketing. Set in 1967, the movie finds a mom/con artist running a fake medium business out of her home. \"Let's add a Ouija board to the proceedings,\" she thinks. \"It'll be fun.\" Spoiler: it is not fun, at least for her family. But it's a spooky good time for the rest of us. **You can stream _Origin of Evil_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80106763 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Dawn of the Dead_ (2004)\nDirector Zack Snyder commits a bit of cinematic blasphemy in remaking George Romero's brutal and pointedly funny 1978 satire; this one doesn't try for social commentary or consumerist critiques, and that's probably for the best. What we get instead is a sharp, fast-paced, and fairly well-acted zombie action movie. It's brisk and brutal and without much socially redeeming value, but manages to be a bloody good time even still. **You can stream _Dawn of the Dead_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/60033340 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _There's Something in the Barn_ (2023)\nA Christmastime horror comedy from Norway that, I'd say, can be enjoyed any time of the year that you're in the mood for holiday fear. An American family is dragged back to their ancestral family farm in rural Gudbrandsdalen, Norway by an overzealous dad. No one else is terribly happy about it until they discover an elf living on the property. At first it seems like a cool thing, having a mythical creature out back--until the family begin ignoring the three simple rules one must always observe in the presence of a barn elf. What starts as a quirky holiday comedy turns into a full-bore gorefest by the final act. **You can stream _There's Something in the Barn_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81759890 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Trap_ (2024)\nCooper (Josh Hartnett) is a pretty cool dad in M. Night Shyamalan's latest, taking his daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to see a very cool Taylor Swift-ish pop star in concert. We quickly learn, though, that Cooper is a hunted serial killer, and that the FBI knows that \"The Butcher\" will be at the concert, even if they don't know exactly who it is. Of such premises are fun thrillers made, as Cooper has to try to escape the pop concert while somehow making sure his daughter gets to enjoy the show. **You can stream _Trap_ [_here_](https://www.netflix.com/title/81776699 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Ver onica_ (2017)\n_Loosely_ based on _purportedl_ y true events, this import from Spain is all spooky atmosphere and old-school chills. It's the story of a young woman who conjures up evil demons following some ill-conceived Ouija-play. (Seriously: Stop messing with those things). When some friends try to conjure up lost loved ones during a solar eclipse, they wind up making contact with a spirit they weren't expecting. Because of course they do. It's not the most original chiller, but the creepy fundamentals are sound, and there are plenty of solid scares. **You can stream _Ver onica_** [**here**](https://www.netflix.com/title/80109295 \"open in a new window\")**.**\n* * *\n## _Sister Death_ (2023)\nIf _Ver onica _was your cup of sangria, you can click right over to this sequel (actually a prequel set in 1939), following Sister Narcisa (Aria Bedmar) after she arrives at a Spanish convent**.** As a child she'd supposedly seen a vision of the Virgin Mary, making her both famous and a bit notorious around the place, which quite naturally is rife with spooky doings in the style of several other nun-related horror-movies of recent years. _Sister Death_ breaks from the habit by being just a bit scarier, and quite a bit smarter in its consideration of all the ways religion can turn people into monsters. **You can stream _Sister Death_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81478662 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Hunger_ (2023)\nThis one isn't billed as a horror film, but good luck finding a more harrowing psychological thriller on the streamer. Whether it's _The Bear_ , _The Menu_ , or _Triangle of Sadness_ , some of the most intense dramas on TV and in film are centered around preparing or eating food. Restaurant-related anxiety is deep in the zeitgeist right now, perhaps reflecting our deep understanding that the food is running low, whether we care to acknowledge it or not. Here, Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying plays Ayo, a young woman working in a family noodle shop who finds a mentor in the dictatorial Chef Paul (Nopachai Chaiyanam). It's worth it, she figures, even as her climb exposes her to a world for which she's not prepared. **You can stream _Hunger_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81517155 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _1922_ (2017)\nAnother Stephen King adaptation (this one from a novella) and another reminder that, while they aren't all winners, there's still plenty of gold to be mined from the King canon. Here, farmer Thomas Jane convinces his son to help him kill wife and mother Molly Parker (she wants to sell the family farm and move to the big city), leading to a solid example of the one-thing-leads-to-another genre of horror film, wherein the lead character just keeps getting deeper and deeper into a crime with increasingly wild and horrific results. **You can stream _1922_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80135164 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Watcher (2022)_\nA straightforward premise is impossibly tense under the direction of Chloe Okuno. An American couple moves to Bucharest, and Julia (Maika Monroe) quickly finds herself isolated: She's alone for hours of the day while her husband works and she doesn't speak the language, so has a hard time making friends or even communicating. So it's even more terrifying than it might otherwise be when she starts seeing a man who appears to be following and watching her wherever she goes. **You can stream _Watcher_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81586244 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Bird Box_ (2018)\nThis high-concept thriller might be horror-lite in some regards, but the clever premise generates a ton of tension throughout. The premise here is that, if you see the creatures that have descended upon the world, you die. So Bullock and co. are forced to navigate by sound alone, and the invisible threats are almost certainly more scary than anything Netflix might have visualized. The sequel, _Bird Box: Barcelona_ (also a Netflix original), is somewhat less effective but still entertaining. **You can stream _Bird Box_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80196789 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Ritual_ (2017)\nWhat do you do when one of your best friends is murdered in a botched liquor store robbery? Go to Sweden and tromp around in the woods, obviously! The four friends here do just that in this effective film that blends don't-get-lost-in-the-woods horror with some genuinely mythological frights that play to the best traditions of folk horror. **You can stream _The Ritual_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80217312 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Babysitter_ (2017)\nIt's not terribly original, but that's kind of the point. In the film, 12-year-ole Cole finds out that his hot babysitter (Samara Weaving) is part of a murderous satanic cult. It's a bloody, gory, high-energy comedy from director McG (_Charlie 's Angels_), and one with a really game supporting cast having fun playing with, and against, the usual tropes. The 2020 sequel, _Killer Queen_ , feels like more of the same--but worth a look if you enjoy this one. **You can stream _The Babysitter_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80164456 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Calibre_ (2018)\nIt's more of a thriller than a straight-up horror movie, but there's enough of a body count here to qualify, and an ending that goes pretty hard (there are Scottish townies involved, so the folk-horror vibes are well-earned). On a hunting trip in the highlands, two posh and obnoxious friends accidentally kill a child, and then his father. The two men figure they can just cover up the crime and get on with their lives--which, of course, they absolutely cannot. **You can stream _Calibre_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80198478 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _May the Devil Take You_ (2018)\nIndonesia has been a particularly fertile ground for the development of horror movies for a long time, and Netflix has hosted a few recent bangers. This one's a pretty straight-up story of demonic possession and being very careful what you wish for, involving a man who sells his soul for wealth and success, only to release a demonic presence that brings goopy, gory harm to his loved ones. It might not be the most _visually_ explicit in terms of its body horror, but it's up there. The 2020 sequel, _May the Devil Take You Too_ , is almost as good. **You can stream _May the Devil Take You_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81030893 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Malevolent_ (2018)\nIt goes off the rails a bit (quite a bit, actually) in the final act, but Florence Pugh (as Angela) gives a great performance of one half of a scammy brother-sister team of ghostbusters in the 1980s. In Scotland. In the course of the movie, Angela discovers that her mom's supposed ability to communicate with the dead wasn't a lie, and that she also has the ability--complicating their lives, especially when the siblings learn more than they should about a house where a group of children were killed. **You can stream _Malevolent_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80242081 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Fear Street Trilogy_(2021)\nI'm covering three movies at once here, as each film in the trilogy, adapted from the R. L. Stine books, shares a tone, quality, and director (Leigh Janiak, best known for _Honeymoon_ prior to _Fear Street_). _Fear Street Part One: 1994_ kicks off the films by introducing the town of Shadyside, which the local kids call \"Shittyside,\" and has a dark history of multiple murders, most of them covered up. A group of teens upsets the grave of a witch, kicking off the revival of a murderous cult. The vibe here is a little bit _Stranger Things_ , with some legit gore and scares (it's YA, but definitely not kids' stuff) as Janiak pays homage to a wide range of horror movies past. The series continues with a camp slasher homage in _Fear Street Part Two: 1978,_ and then an origin that brings things to a conclusion in _Fear Street Part Three: 1666_. **You can stream _Fear Street Part One: 1994_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81325689 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Perfection_ (2018)\nA short synopsis, involving Charlotte Willmore (Allison Williams) returning to her prestigious music academy after an absence and finding that another woman (Logan Browning) has taken her place at the head of the class, might make it seem as though we're entering _Black Swan_ territory, at worst--but the intentionally disjointed narrative here quickly careens into wildly claustrophobic body horror. It might not be the first film to mine dark thrills and gore out of arts education (_Suspiria_ , anyone?) but it goes as far as any of them, and even beyond. **You can stream _The Perfection_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211638 \"open in a new window\")****.**",

Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\nFinding great travel deals is a skill, but it's one that can be honed--if you know where to source a bargain, can be patient and flexible, _and_ if you know you can take advantage of the [24-hour free federal cancelation policy](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/notice-24hour-reservation \"open in a new window\") to lock in a time-sensitive opportunity. \nHere are some of the best travel websites you can use to snag your next trip on the cheap.\n## Use Skyscanner to find the cheapest flights\nYes, Google Flights is more user-friendly and has cool features (like the [\"explore\" tool](https://www.google.com/travel/explore \"open in a new window\") to see a map of your potential destinations and their prices), but if you mean business and are looking for the _cheapest_ flight options you can find, [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/flights \"open in a new window\") is what you want to use. Here, you'll find flights that will not even appear on Google Flights, and it even has an [explore-like](https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights-from/atla/?oym=2506 \"open in a new window\") tool similar to Google's where you simply input your local airport, select \"whole month\" for dates, and click \"search\" to find all the possible low-cost destinations for that month (I found a direct flight to Cancun from my home in Atlanta for $183). \nYou can catch last-minute flight deals and set alerts for cheap flights as well.\n## Use SecretFlying to set up alerts for their \"Error Fares\"\nAirlines make mistakes sometimes, and as a savvy traveler, you need to be ready to take advantage of them when you can. [SecretFlying](https://www.secretflying.com/usa-deals/ \"open in a new window\") is a travel deal website that works like many others, but it also has a special tool to find cheap flights that exist because of mistakes that airlines make. (For example, there was an enticing [Chicago to London round-trip for only $58](https://www.secretflying.com/posts/error-fare-chicago-to-london-uk-for-only-58-roundtrip/ \"open in a new window\") last month.) The error fares go fast, and many might not logistically work for you, but if you ever do catch one of these, you'll be bragging about it for years to come. \n## Use the Travel Arrow extension\nIf you're still only using Google Flights to do your searching, you could be missing out on some cheaper options. Travel Arrow is an extension you can install on your browser that will [cross-reference your Google Flight info](https://lifehacker.com/this-chrome-extension-searches-every-airline-booking-si-1850709238) on Skyscanner, Kayak, Trip, and Expedia (all the major competitors to Google Flights). While it doesn't always work, it's a free tool that will more than pay for itself if you ever end up booking a cheaper flight with it. Keep in mind that some flights might be cheaper because their layovers are longer.\n## Use these online vacation package websites\nThere are _many_ websites that sell you travel packages that include flights, hotels, food, tours, and even transportation (rails, bus, taxis, etc.) for _much_ cheaper than you would find if you tried to book each piece individually. The catch is that these packages are typically strict on dates, and their cancelation policies are often less forgiving. _But_ , you'll be able to find amazing deals to locations you might not otherwise be able to afford. \n[Gate1](https://www.gate1travel.com/?Brand=GATE1 \"open in a new window\"), for example, has been around since the '80s--my mom has used it with my dad to visit the eight wonders of the world on a budget over the years. Their best deals come from their [weekly specials](https://www.gate1travel.com/featured-specials \"open in a new window\") (you can sign up for their emails) and [last-minute deals](https://www.gate1travel.com/last-minute-deals \"open in a new window\") where you can find multi-day trips for big discounts. \nFor example, you can do a 13-day Thailand trip for $2,249 with all this included:\n  * Roundtrip flights Los Angeles to Bangkok, or Bangkok to Los Angeles \n  * Intra-flight Chiang Mai to Bangkok\n  * 11 nights First Class accommodations\n  * Hotel taxes, fees, service charges, and porterage\n  * 18 meals: 11 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 4 dinners\n  * Sightseeing per itinerary in modern air-conditioned motor coach\n  * Services of English-speaking tour manager throughout\n  * Entrance fees per itinerary\n\n\nHere are some other websites similar to Gate1 where you can find great deals on packages for your next trip:\n  * [TravelPirates](https://www.travelpirates.com/ \"open in a new window\")\n  * [Great Value Vacations](https://www.greatvaluevacations.com/ \"open in a new window\")\n  * [Going](https://www.going.com/ \"open in a new window\") (formerly Scott's Cheap Flights)",

    "title": "14 Games You Should Play If You Like Wordle",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Wordle became an instant classic almost as soon as it launched, but its simplicity is also the source of a new problem: what to play when you've already guessed the day's word? Fortunately, the years since Wordle's appearance have blessed us with dozens of other guessing games that borrowed one or more of Wordle's features--five-letter solutions, or yellow and green squares, or sometimes just the concept of guessing and getting hints to narrow down the possibilities. Here are 14 of the best.\n## Waffle\nCredit: Waffle\nLet's start out the list with a cute and friendly game. [Waffle](https://wafflegame.net/daily \"open in a new window\") puts six different five-letter words in a grid, and you [solve it](https://lifehacker.com/waffle-is-the-new-wordle-1848793653) simply by moving the squares around. It's tricky to get the job done in the given number of swaps, but you're never going to be too perplexed--all the letters you need are right in front of you.\n## Flagle\nCredit: Flagle\nI was torn on whether to award the geographical spot on the list to [Flagle](https://flagle.net/ \"open in a new window\"), which uses country flags, or [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/ \"open in a new window\"), which [gives you the outline of the country](https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-try-worldle-the-new-geography-version-o-1848539965). When I was first compiling this list, I went with Flagle because there [used to be two ways to win](https://lifehacker.com//now-there-s-a-wordle-for-flags-with-two-ways-to-win-1849734199): In addition to narrowing down the location of the country, you can also reveal tiles of the country's flag. Unfortunately, Flagle has removed the feature that tells you how far away you guessed in terms of distance, so it's now just a flag-based game. They're still both great.\n## Hurdle\nCredit: Hurdle\nThis is probably the last friendly, straightforward game you'll see on this list, so enjoy it while it lasts. [Hurdle](https://www.arkadium.com/games/hurdle/ \"open in a new window\") gives you five Wordle-style puzzles each day. You have to [solve each to get the next](https://lifehacker.com/hurdle-is-like-five-wordles-in-one-1848823944), and then the fifth puzzle gets pre-filled with the four previous solutions as guesses, leaving you just two chances to win the final round.\n## Absurdle\nCredit: Absurdle\n[Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html \"open in a new window\") gets its name because its premise is entirely absurd--and [man, does it follow through](https://lifehacker.com/try-this-game-if-youre-already-too-good-at-wordle-1848356298). The secret word you're guessing _changes to evade your guesses_. Its one nod to sportsmanship is that it will abide by its previous hints--so if it tells you that the word contains an R as the first letter, the solution _will_ have an R, but everything else is subject to change. Succeeding at this game means backing the algorithm into a corner until it only has one option left; only then will it admit you won.\n## Heardle\nCredit: Heardle\n[Heardle](https://heardlewordle.io/ \"open in a new window\") is the modern version of [_Name That Tune!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_That_Tune \"open in a new window\"), a game show where participants had to identify a song based on just the first few notes. The songs in Heardle are taken from popular playlists, so it's also a good litmus test for your own pop culture relevance. \n## Squabble\nCredit: Squabble\nIn [Squabble](https://squabble.me/ \"open in a new window\"), we have our first competitive Wordle. (We'll meet another in a minute.) If you think you're good at guessing words, you now get the chance to [prove it against friends or strangers in real time](https://lifehacker.com/squabble-lets-you-beat-other-people-at-wordle-in-real-t-1848849342). Guessing wrong subtracts health from your little meter; guessing correctly refills it. The game continues, going to multiple words if needed, until all but one player has been eliminated. This game isn't as popular as it once was, so you may wait a while to find enough players for a game with online strangers, but you can still create a game and share the lobby code with your friends for instant fun. \n## Mordle\nCredit: Mordle\nIf you like Squabble, try the massively multiplayer [Mordle](https://www.mordle.io/ \"open in a new window\"). Games can have up to 100 players, but [gameplay is simpler](https://lifehacker.com/mordle-lets-you-play-wordle-against-100-people-and-i-l-1848950108) because you don't have to watch their game boards or battle them directly. Just attempt to solve the puzzle yourself, as fast as you can, and find out how many people got to the correct solution before or after you. \n## Quordle and other multi-Wordles\nCredit: Quordle\nWhen Dordle (the double Wordle) first came on the scene, it seemed nightmarish; you're supposed to solve _two_ Wordles with the same guesses?! But with practice, it's not hard at all. And so it escalated from there. [Quordle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/ \"open in a new window\") is the sweet spot, in [my opinion](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319); four is the perfect number of puzzles to solve at once. But [Octordle](https://www.britannica.com/games/octordle/ \"open in a new window\") is also fun, and so are [Sedecordle](https://www.sedecordle.com/ \"open in a new window\") and [Duotrigordle](https://duotrigordle.com/ \"open in a new window\"). Multi-Wordles appear daunting at first, but with so many grids, almost any guess is going to give you a useful hint _somewhere_.\n## Antiwordle\nCredit: Antiwordle\n[Antiwordle](https://www.antiwordle.com/ \"open in a new window\") is probably the [most hellish](https://lifehacker.com/i-hate-antiwordle-and-thats-why-i-play-it-every-mornin-1848756496) of all the games on this list, and that's saying something. The rules are the same as the rules for regular Wordle played on hard mode (where you're required to reuse correct letter guesses). But the whole idea is that you're trying to _not_ guess the word. Once you get it right, you lose.\n## Semantle\nCredit: Semantle\nWord games are, for the most part, games for good spellers. If you can recognize the patterns letters commonly appear in, you're at an advantage. So if you've ever wondered why word games don't ask you to guess the approximate _meaning_ of a word, [Semantle](https://semantle.com/ \"open in a new window\") is for you. It's tough to even begin narrowing it down, but once you do, just aim for words with similar meanings to arrive at the answer.\n## WordAll\nCredit: WordAll\nAny time you get your green and yellow squares in response to a guess, what the game is really doing is defining and redefining a pool of words that the solution must be in. (All the words that have an E in the second position and a T in them somewhere other than the third, let's say.) [WordAll](https://wordall.xyz/ \"open in a new window\") gives you a half-played game, pauses it there, and asks you to name all the words in that pool. [It's a fun brain exercise](https://lifehacker.com/wordall-makes-you-guess-all-the-words-1848968860), and will probably make you a more strategic Wordle player.\n## Artle\nCredit: Artle\nWe'll back away from words for this one, an art-themed game that shows you snippets of works, all created by the same artist. It's called [Artle](https://www.nga.gov/artle \"open in a new window\"), and it will probably [teach you things you didn't know about your favorite artists](https://lifehacker.com/you-might-actually-learn-something-from-this-wordle-for-1849142844)--and help you discover new ones.\n## Squardle\nCredit: Squardle\nIf you thought Waffle was cute, [Squardle](https://fubargames.se/squardle/ \"open in a new window\") is [its evil twin](https://lifehacker.com/squardle-broke-my-brain-and-then-i-won-1848799909). It's another crossword-style guessing game, but this time you have to type all your guesses in. That doesn't sound so bad, until you start trying to make sense of the hints. Each square contains color-coded information about how the letter you guessed fits into the words of the puzzle. Like Microsoft's Clippy, something intended to be helpful quickly turns confusing and frustrating. Winning this game requires you to use the those hints without letting their proliferation distract you.\n## Redactle\nCredit: Redactle\nOne word at a time? Six words at a time? [Redactle](https://redactle.net/ \"open in a new window\") scoffs at all that. It gives you an _entire Wikipedia article_ with most of the words blacked out, in the style of censored government documents. Your job is to guess words; when you guess correctly, those words are revealed in the article. Solving the puzzle means correctly guessing the title of the article--which could be about anything from a historical figure to a mathematical concept.",

A [new peer-to-peer payment feature](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-new-tap-to-transfer-feature-for-samsung-wallet/ \"open in a new window\") transfers funds from debit cards in your Samsung Wallet to those stored in a recipient's digital wallet or their physical tap-to-pay card. \nThe feature will be available to Samsung Wallet users in the U.S. later this month. \n## How Samsung Wallet 'Tap to Transfer' works\nSamsung's new \"Tap to Transfer\" feature utilizes NFC technology to connect to debit cards in any digital wallet, meaning you can send cash even if the recipient uses a different third-party app (like Apple Wallet or Google Wallet) or only has a physical debit card. Alternatively, you can transfer money to other Samsung Wallet users by searching for their phone number if they aren't nearby to tap. \nThere are a few benefits to Tap to Transfer. First, it doesn't require everyone to use the same peer-to-peer payment service like Venmo or Cash App, making it easier in situations like splitting dinner bills to move money around to all members of the group and eliminating the hassle of signing up for a new app. It also deposits funds to linked bank accounts in minutes (depending on the bank), so you don't have to wait days or pay fees for instant transfers. (Note that the debit card in your Samsung Wallet must be a Visa or Mastercard for this feature to work.)\nSamsung Wallet, like Apple Wallet and Google Wallet, allows users to store everything from payment cards and IDs to loyalty cards and digital keys to concert tickets and boarding passes. Apple also has a peer-to-peer payment feature called Tap to Cash, but both users must have compatible iOS or watchOS devices with Apple Cash already set up.",

    "title": "It's Time to Audit Your Autopay Subscriptions",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "On average, Americans spend $77 each month (or $924 annually) on subscriptions, according to a [recent survey.](https://bango.com/resources/subscription-wars-super-bundling-awakens/ \"open in a new window\") But how many of those subscriptions are really adding value to our lives, and how many are set to autopay and simply slip through the cracks every month? From streaming entertainment and fitness apps to meal delivery kits and software tools, if you're not sure what you're spending every month on subscriptions, it's time for a personal audit.\n## Why you need to audit your subscriptions\nWhile subscription services offer convenience, they can silently drain your bank account when left unchecked. There's a reason why auto-renewal subscription payments are referred to as \"evergreen.\" At the end of either a monthly or annual subscription term, these services renew automatically unless you choose to cancel. Of course, this is why they're so hard to track. If you stop using the service, you tend to forget the service exists and not notice the charges adding up.\nPlus, it's all too easy to fall victim to a free trial trap. Many services lure customers with free trials that automatically convert to paid subscriptions. Companies count on you forgetting to cancel before the trial ends, turning your momentary interest into a recurring expense.\nEven if you're selective on your end, subscription services frequently raise their prices after you've become dependent on them. These increases might seem small individually, but they add up across multiple services.\n## How to conduct a subscription audit\nSure, you can download a dedicated subscription tracking service. These apps connect to your bank accounts and automatically identify your subscription services, which you can then track on a custom dashboard. But remember that many of these apps are tiered and additional services might charge you a monthly fee, which makes them… yet another autopay subscription service. Here's how to conduct an audit on your own, for free. \n### Track down all your subscriptions\nThe first step is to identify recurring charges on your credit card, debit card, or online banking accounts. Set aside an hour to list all of your monthly and annual subscription expenses for the past year. Don't recognize a few of them? Or maybe there's a service you like but rarely use? Go ahead and cancel those. Create a calendar reminder for yourself to do this every month or so if you really want to stay on top of it.\nSome charges might not be easy to pin down, so you need to play detective using the following steps: \n  * Review the last three months of credit card and bank statements\n  * Check your email for subscription confirmations and receipts\n  * Look through your app store subscriptions (Apple App Store, Google Play)\n  * Check payment services like PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App\n  * Review your Amazon recurring orders and subscriptions\n\n\nDon't forget annual subscriptions that might not appear in recent statements.\n### Create a subscription tracker\nNow it's time for a spreadsheet. For each subscription, document:\n  * Service name\n  * Monthly/annual cost\n  * Billing date\n  * Last time you used the service\n  * Whether it's essential or non-essential\n\n\nThis visual representation helps you understand your total subscription spending and identify potential cuts.\n### Evaluate each subscription's value\nAssuming you're not going full scorched-earth, you'll need to evaluate each subscription to see if it makes the cut. Ask yourself these questions for each service:\n  * When was the last time I used this?\n  * Does this subscription save me money compared to pay-per-use?\n  * Could I downgrade to a cheaper tier?\n  * Is there a free alternative that would work nearly as well?\n  * Does this subscription meaningfully improve my life?\n\n\nBe honest about which services truly add value, versus those you keep out of habit or inertia.\n### Take action: Cancel, pause, or negotiate\nFor services you decide to keep:\n  * Mark renewal dates on your calendar\n  * Look for annual payment options that might offer discounts\n  * Contact customer service to negotiate better rates\n\n\nFor those you don't need:\n  * Cancel immediately (don't wait until the next billing cycle)\n  * Take screenshots of cancellation confirmations\n  * Remove payment information when possible\n\n\n## The bottom line\nThink about it like this: Even cutting just $50 in monthly subscriptions saves $600 annually. I recommend implementing an ongoing system. Schedule quarterly subscription audits on your calendar, enable notifications for all subscription charges, and even consider a dedicated credit card for subscriptions to easily track spending.\nTake an hour this weekend to audit your subscriptions. Your future self (and bank account) will thank you.",

The update is intended to make it easier to find and choose content you actually want to watch rather than endlessly scrolling through the service's library. \n## What's new on the Netflix TV app\nWhen your Netflix interface updates, you'll find the navigation bar always visible at the top of the screen. There are shortcuts to Search, Shows, Movies, Games, and My Netflix, and a centralized hub for Continue Watching, My List, and Remind Me. The back button on your remote will take you directly to the navigation bar. \nTiles for each piece of content will be much larger and show title details--such as whether it was recently added (or is leaving soon) or has won awards, as well as the synopsis, runtime, and key cast members--up front. The app will also provide more responsive recommendations in real time as you browse based on trailers you watch, titles you thumbs up or down, and searches.

    "content": "You can't go long these days without hearing the word \"[tariff](https://lifehacker.com/money/tariff-scams-to-watch-out-for),\" and for most of us, just hearing it induces anxiety. Family budgets, already a challenge, are going to get a lot more difficult once the predicted price increases and shortages kick in--one study predicts that these new tariffs will cost American households [an average of $3,800](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/where-we-stand-fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-all-us-tariffs-enacted-2025-through-april \"open in a new window\") this year alone.\nIf you're determined to avoid tariff surcharges, you've got your work cut out for you--especially when it comes to [groceries](https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-streamline-your-grocery-shopping-and-s-1850883509). [About 15% of our food supply is imported](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/05/will-grocery-store-prices-increase-with-tariffs/82794175007/ \"open in a new window\"), but that number doesn't necessarily account for food that is sourced domestically but uses imported ingredients. And some staples, like coffee or bananas, are almost exclusively imported. But if you're hoping to avoid tariffs on your [grocery bills,](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/money-saving-shopping-list) you have a few slim options to explore.\n## Albertsons\nAmidst all the warnings of rising grocery prices, there's been one hint of good news: Grocery giant [Albertsons](https://lifehacker.com/money/stores-that-give-rainchecks) announced in late March that it [wouldn't tolerate automatic price increases](https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article305268316.html \"open in a new window\") from its suppliers due to tariffs. It's explicitly framed as a policy designed to keep prices at their current levels.\nThat doesn't mean there won't be _any_ price increases--Albertsons clarified that it would take increases under consideration, but its suppliers would have to basically apply to raise their prices, and the company would consider whether to grant the request. But Albertsons already sources [about 90%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/grocery-operations/albertsons-to-suppliers-you-better-explain-tariff-induced-cost-increases \"open in a new window\") of its products domestically (though this doesn't mean ingredients or other components that might be affected by tariffs aren't included in those domestic products), so this policy could have some real impact on prices.\nThe good news here is that Albertsons is _huge_. They operate more than 20 supermarket chains, including Safeway, Acme, Carrs, and Balducci's Food Lovers Market--a total of more than 2,200 stores across the country. You can see a full list of chains owned by Albertsons [here](https://grocerystory.coop/who-owns-your-grocery-store \"open in a new window\") to see if there are locations near you.\n## Other strategies\nIf you're not close to an Albertsons store and are still determined to void tariffs as much as possible, you have few other options:\n  * **Shop local.** Buying as many groceries from farmer's markets and other direct sources will avoid most tariff price increases, though farmer's markets tend to be slightly more expensive than grocery stores in the first place, so you might not save that much money by going that route.\n  * **Selective shopping.** You can also continue to shop at your local supermarket but pay closer attention to the import status of the items you buy. While you probably won't find much domestic coffee in your grocery store, there are many items that aren't imported and thus should avoid most tariff-driven price increases. This can be laborious, and since domestically-made products can still suffer from tariffs if they include imported ingredients or packaging there's no guarantee you're evading higher prices by looking for a \"made in the USA\" designation.\n\n\nIt's going to be difficult to avoid tariff price increases unless you live near an Albertsons grocery store, at least for the time being. Until more grocery chains follow their lead (or Albertsons rescinds the policy under pressure from their suppliers) that's your best bet for avoiding the tax.",

    "title": "The Seven Best Ways to Budget for Summer",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Summer brings sunshine, vacations, outdoor concerts--and the inability to leave your house without accidentally spending 20 bucks. Your budget is never a truly fixed thing. It changes with the state of the economy (hello, [tariffs](https://lifehacker.com/money/tariff-scams-to-watch-out-for)), your paycheck, and even the changing of the seasons. With a bit of planning, you can enjoy all the summer season has to offer without the financial stress. Here are my hacks to create a practical summer budget that lets you make the most of these warmer months without breaking the bank.\n## Plan around events, not calendar dates\nOne of the biggest summer budgeting mistakes is thinking in terms of months rather than specific activities. Instead of creating a general \"July budget,\" break down your summer into the actual events you plan to attend:\n  * Family beach vacation\n  * Wedding weekend\n  * Local festivals\n  * Holiday celebrations\n  * Back-to-school shopping\n\n\nBy organizing your budget around specific events, you can allocate funds more precisely and avoid the \"_where did my money go?_ \" feeling at the end of the month.\n## Set a weekly \"spontaneous spend\" cap\nSummer weekends often bring impromptu invitations--a backyard BBQ where you need to bring something, a last-minute beach day, or an outdoor concert you just heard about. Rather than letting these spur-of-the-moment activities derail your budget, create a dedicated \"spontaneous spend\" allowance each week.\nWhether it's $30 or $100, having this pre-approved fun money gives you the freedom to say \"yes\" to unexpected opportunities without guilt, while still maintaining financial boundaries.\n## Embrace \"themed\" savings accounts\nI've [said before](https://lifehacker.com/all-the-different-saving-accounts-you-need-1850122921) that dividing your money into multiple accounts helps you see all your saving goals separately, so they'll be easier to track. Similar to [cash stuffing](https://lifehacker.com/start-cash-stuffing-to-curb-your-spending-1849945750) (where you can only spend money in a certain category from its designated envelope), this approach forces you to be more intentional and disciplined about where your money is going. \nCreate separate digital envelopes or savings accounts for your major summer expenses: summer travel, kids' camp costs, recurring happy hour appointments, and so on.\nMost online banks let you create multiple savings buckets at no extra cost. By keeping these funds separate from your regular checking account, you'll resist the temptation to dip into your vacation money for everyday expenses.\n## Implement the 24-hour rule for summer purchases\nWhen temperatures rise, so does [impulse spending](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-unconscious-spending) on seasonal items like new patio furniture, outdoor gear, or summer fashion. Combat this by instituting a 24-hour waiting period for any non-essential purchase over $50.\nOften, the cooling-off period reveals that you don't actually need that inflatable pool flamingo or designer sunglasses. For larger purchases, extend this to a 48-hour or even 72-hour rule.\n## Create a summer-specific meal plan\nFood costs typically increase during summer months due to social gatherings, vacation eating, and, you know, the temptation of ice-cream trucks. Some ways you can combat this:\n  * Planning picnic-friendly, portable meals that work for beach days or park outings\n  * Researching grocery stores at your vacation destination and planning a \"first day\" shopping trip\n  * Setting a specific \"dining out\" budget for vacation days\n  * Taking advantage of seasonal produce that's cheaper during summer months\n\n\nA summer-focused meal plan acknowledges that your eating patterns change with the season while keeping food expenses in check. Plus, it gives you an excuse to get into some new recipes! Check out my colleague [Allie Reinmann's](https://lifehacker.com/author/alliechanthornreinmann) tips for [making the most of summer berries](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/summer-berries-grunt-recipe), or whipping up a budget-friendly [summery shrimp roll](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/easy-shrimp-roll-recipe).\n## Audit your subscription services before vacations\nBefore heading out on summer trips, [take inventory of your subscription services](https://lifehacker.com/its-time-to-audit-your-autopay-subscriptions-1845328634). Are you paying for streaming services you won't use while traveling? Consider pausing memberships like:\n  * Gym memberships\n  * Meal kit deliveries\n  * Beauty box subscriptions\n  * Digital subscriptions you won't have time for\n\n\nMany services offer pause options rather than full cancellations, making it easy to temporarily reduce monthly expenses during your heaviest travel periods.\n## Build in budget buffer zones\nEven the best budget needs flexibility, especially during summer. As you're estimating travel costs and setting spend caps, add a 15% buffer. Gas prices, summer storms, and all other kinds of unexpected costs always emerge. This buffer creates financial breathing room and prevents minor overages from snowballing into major budget problems.\n## The bottom line\nSummer should be about creating memories, not financial stress. A little preparation now means you can focus on sunshine and fun later--without the looming dread of post-summer credit card bills.\nRemember that the best summer budget isn't necessarily the tightest one, but rather the one that aligns with your priorities and gives you permission to enjoy what matters most to you this season.",

    "title": "How Microsoft's New, Smaller Surface Devices Compare to the MacBook Air and iPad Pro",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nMicrosoft [announced a pair](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2025/05/06/introducing-all-new-surface-copilot-pcs-the-surface-pro-12-inch-and-surface-laptop-13-inch/ \"open in a new window\") of ultraportable Surface devices yesterday, both of which differ significantly from their predecessors. There's the creatively named Surface Laptop 13-inch, which is shrunken down from the previous model's 13.8-inches, as well as a new version of the Surface Pro, which is down from 13-inches to a 12-inch chassis. Like the rest of the Surface lineup, both are positioned to compete in the same space as Apple's MacBook Air, which comes in 13-inch and 15-inch varieties, and the latter could even potentially come for the iPad Pro, which hovers around a similar price point. The trick this time around? Aside from being smaller, they're also cheaper.\n## The compromises\nAlong with shrinking the sizes and prices on these new Surface devices, Microsoft has also cut down the specs a bit to match. The 13-inch laptop, available in ocean (a metallic blue), violet, or platinum finishes, slashes the resolution of the previous iteration down from 2304 x 1536 to 1920 x 1280, to accommodate the smaller display. The panel also lacks HDR, and the refresh rate has dropped from 120Hz down to 60Hz. \nThe 12-inch Pro model also, notably, doesn't include a keyboard by default, although this isn't entirely unique for the Surface Pro. The Surface keyboard has been redesigned, too, and while it still connects magnetically, it lays flat rather than at an angle. Additionally, Microsoft has ditched the included slot for the Surface Pen, which will now attach to, and charge directly on, the back of the Surface Pro itself. Finally, the Pro's display has also dumped some refresh rate overboard, dropping to 90Hz from 120Hz, although it maintains a 2196 x 1464 resolution.\nAlso gone from both Surface models are the handy Surface Connect ports with their magnetic attachment points, replaced with standard USB-C 3.2 ports. While this means fewer proprietary cables, it also means that there's a danger of tripping on the cord and, instead of having the cable easily disconnect, pulling your entire laptop onto the floor. \nFinally, for internals, both of the new Surface devices are built around the 8-Core Snapdragon X Plus chip from Qualcomm. These lose two cores off the default of prior models. Both also default to a respectable 16GB of RAM, though a fairly scant 256GB of storage, with the option to double it to 512GB (the default on prior models) if you're willing to pay for the privilege. \n## Can these budget Surface models hold up against Apple?\nGenerally, when it comes to raw specs, Apple's alternatives outclass these new Surface releases, with one caveat. Let's start with displays.\nHere, Apple has more features and supports higher resolutions. The Liquid Retina panel in the MacBook offers HDR with a resolution at 2560 x 1664, although it's also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, despite being smaller then the 12-inch Surface Pro, the iPad Pro 11-inch model sports a sharp 2420 x 1668 resolution (which can go up to 2752 x 2064 on the 13-inch version), plus it's [OLED](https://lifehacker.com/tech/oled-vs-qled-differences) and has a variable refresh rate that tops out at 120Hz. \nAs for performance, while the Snapdragon chip in the new Surfaces is certainly efficient, it doesn't compare favorably to Apple's M4 chip, which is at the heart of both the latest iPad Pro and MacBook Air. It falls behind in both single-core and multi-core performance, so Apple's devices have a clear advantage for those that prioritize horsepower.\nBut one significant difference between the two Surface devices is how they're cooled, which sees at least one improvement over prior Surface iterations. Like the MacBook Air and iPad Pro, the smaller 12-inch Pro is completely fanless, and the more thermally efficient processor has also allowed Microsoft to remove the vents present in the previous version of the Pro. Sadly, the same can't be said of the 13-inch Surface Laptop, which still includes fans.\n## Lower prices\nMicrosoft's goal with these new models seems to have been to keep prices as low as possible, so these compromises do come with savings, and here is one spot where PC beats Mac. \nStarting prices for these models fall below $1,000 and, most importantly, below the MSRP of the MacBook Air and iPad Pro. The Surface Laptop 13-inch starts at $899 and the Surface Pro 12-inch at $799, while the base MacBook Air retails for $999 for the 13-inch model and $1,199 for the 15-inch model. The iPad Pro, meanwhile, starts at $999 for the 11-inch version and $1,299 for the 13-inch upgrade. If cost is king, the new Surface lineup may be the best fit for you, but bear in mind that there's only a $100 margin between the base price of the Surface Laptop and the MacBook Air. \nThat said, upgrades are costly on both sides. Again, adding the keyboard to the 12-inch Pro will add another $150 to your price tag, and bumping the storage up to 512GB will inflate the price another $100, meaning you're looking at $1,049 for the full package. Similarly, the 13-inch laptop jumps another $100 if you want to increase the storage to 512GB, totaling $999. But upgrading nearly any facet of one of the Apple devices adds up quickly as well; for instance, jumping from 256GB to 512GB of storage on the Air will immediately add $200 to the price tag. \nSo, as is common when looking at PC vs. Mac, the question ultimately comes down to price vs. performance. Surface is now more budget-friendly than ever, but there are compromises to keep in mind with those savings. Luckily, the rest of Microsoft's Surface lineup is still as available as ever, so if you pay up, you can find more performant alternatives to Apple's machines.\nThe Surface Laptop 13-inch is available to preorder from [_Amazon_](https://zdcs.link/92xkKW?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon&short_url=92xkKW&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), [_Microsoft_](https://zdcs.link/QObKVB?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Microsoft&short_url=QObKVB&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), and other retailers.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Alongside a couple of [new Surface devices](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2025/05/06/introducing-all-new-surface-copilot-pcs-the-surface-pro-12-inch-and-surface-laptop-13-inch/ \"open in a new window\"), Microsoft [has also announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/05/06/introducing-a-new-generation-of-windows-experiences/ \"open in a new window\") a number of notable upgrades on the way for Windows 11, covering the Start menu, Copilot AI, and core Windows utilities such as Paint and the Snipping Tool.\nThe Start menu changes are significant, and [I wrote about them](https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-is-planning-big-changes-to-the-start-menu-in-windows-11) last month when they were first spotted in hidden code. The menu is becoming bigger, more customizable, and more usable, with the option to see all apps immediately--and several options for how those apps are arranged on screen.\nIf you don't want to see recommended shortcuts (to recent files, for example), these can be hidden. You can also increase the size of the pinned apps panel. Another change is the addition of a \"phone companion\" (essentially the Phone Link app) on the right of the Start menu.\nThis revamp is coming to the Windows Insider channel in the next month, Microsoft says, and there are several other updates on the same timetable. One is AI actions in File Explorer, which will give you access to AI-powered features from the right-click menu: Think summarizing documents and editing images.\nAnother feature coming soon to Windows Insider users is AI text generation and summarizing in Notepad, plus lightweight formatting options. For the first time you'll be able to make text bold and italic inside Notepad, and introduce lists and headings. There will also be support for the Markdown formatting language.\nAlready available to Windows Insiders, and coming soon to everyone else, we have Copilot Vision. It means you can chat with the AI about whatever's on screen--whether you want shopping advice or help with image editing-- and Microsoft has previously given us a good idea [of how it works](https://lifehacker.com/tech/copilot-vision-and-file-search-windows-insider-program).\n## Features for Copilot+ PCs\nSome of the newly announced features are arriving first on [Copilot+ PCs](https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-announces-copilot-plus-pcs) (those that meet a certain performance criteria) with Snapdragon chipsets. Again, these updates are appearing in the Windows Insider channel first, before making their way to everyone else with a Copilot+ PC. Microsoft has intimated that they'll roll out eventually to PCs powered by AMD or Intel.\nFirst, Microsoft is putting an AI agent inside Settings, so you can get help finding the toggle switch you need or figuring out how to do something. One example shown in the Microsoft demo is typing \"my text is too small\" to find the option for font size. The AI agent can even change settings for you, if you give it permission.\nWe're also getting more actions for [the Click to Do feature](https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-just-dropped-a-bunch-of-new-copilot-features) (essentially an AI-powered, context-sensitive right-click menu), including options to schedule meetings in Teams or launch the Immersive Reader mode for text. Windows search is getting a boost too, with greater coverage for photos, settings, and the Microsoft Store.\nThe Photos app built into Windows has slowly been [getting better and better](https://lifehacker.com/tech/windows-built-in-photo-app-free-good-photoshop-alternative), and it'll soon pick up a relight feature for dynamic lighting control. You'll be able to set up to three lighting sources, and adjust the brightness and intensity, while seeing the changes on the image in real time.\nAs for Paint, it's gaining the ability to create custom stickers from text prompts, and a new object select tool that will use AI to select objects with a single click. If you need to move or remove something in an image, this should make the process of selecting it faster and more straightforward.\nThe Windows Snipping Tool is getting more features as well: intelligent screenshot cropping, the ability to extract text from screenshots, and a color picker. Finally, the Narrator on Copilot+ PCs is being upgraded to offer rich image descriptions, so it'll be able to describe charts, photos, and other visual elements that are on screen.",

    "title": "Here's What I Learned After Six Months of Wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nSix months ago, I reviewed the [Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses](https://lifehacker.com/tech/review-ray-ban-meta-glasses). If you've been off-grid, these specs pack a camera, open-ear speakers, microphones, and voice-activated [Meta AI](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-meta-ai-on-facebook-instagram-messenger-whatsapp) inside a pair of Wayfarer-style frames, so they're basically science fiction glasses that look normal. I liked them so much, I had prescription lenses put in and made them part of my daily load out. But it's easy to love a tech product when it's new and shiny; the real test is how the Ray-Ban Metas fair after they've gone from novelty to another damn thing I have to remember to charge. Bottom line: I still really like them after half a year of wearing them while working, sitting around, biking, running errands, and generally living my boring life. But I like them in a more nuanced way.\n[ Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses  $263.00 at Best Buy Learn More  Learn More  $263.00 at Best Buy ](https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=07ceq7iAfFfRlRYt8DCvPYM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fray-ban-meta-wayfarer-large-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-polarized-gradient-graphite-lens-refurbished-matte-black%2F6609615.p%3FskuId%3D6609615&template=Opinions&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&position=1&element_label=Ray-Ban+Meta+smart+glasses&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&product_uuid=04JCa9ut2mm6RrhT8SA24TX&offer_uuid=00OiBDzxOZtWxELDllpCJjg&pageview_type=RSS&object_type=00OiBDzxOZtWxELDllpCJjg&object_uuid=04JCa9ut2mm6RrhT8SA24TX \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")\n## Not quite everyday glasses\nAfter the initial sugar rush wore off, I started noticing the weight of the Ray-Ban Metas. They're around 49 grams out of the box, fairly heavy for sunglasses, but prescription lenses bumped the weight up to 54 grams. My regular specs are pretty chunky and weigh 39 grams, and the difference is noticeable. They're slightly uncomfortable for extended use. I found myself wearing regular glasses when I didn't expect to use smart features, and going back to the Ray-Bans if I wanted to take photos, record video, or go hands-free. The main downside was forgetting which pair I was wearing and saying \"Hey Meta\" to my dumb glasses. (But that's a me problem.)\n## Build quality, durability, and style: no complaints\nI have to commend Ray-Ban, Meta, and whatever factory physically built these glasses, because they held up flawlessly. The tech works just as well now as it did when I got them, and the frames themselves held up, too: no warping, bent arms, or other malfunctions. (I didn't necessarily baby them or take special care of them.) They didn't go out of style in the last six months either, seeing as the Wayfarer design is timeless. If they're good enough for James Dean, they're good enough for me.\n## Battery life could be better\nMeta says their smart glasses have a battery life of \"up to four hours,\" which is mildly optimistic--these things need to be charged often. The solution of having a charger built into the glasses' case is acceptable most of the time because the main function of eyeglasses (ensuring I can see things) works even when the batteries run out. But longer outings where I wanted to take lots of photos or videos were a pain. Your choices are to only have pictures of the first half of the graduation ceremony, or pack a back-up pair of glasses so you can charge on the fly. \nAnother battery related annoyance: You can't disable the low battery notification without disabling all notifications. While that's the case for many tech products, it would be great to have the option to disable it for these glasses.\n## The social factor: being seen isn't always the best\nWhen I first started wearing the Ray-Ban Metas daily, they pretty much flew under people's radars, but as popular awareness of the product grew, so did the people who noticed I was wearing them. More than one person asked \"are you taking pictures of me?\" and I didn't love having my glasses spark conversations about surveillance or Meta's motives, but I get why some people are wary. They blur the line between fashion and tech in a way that's still new, and many people find them off-putting.\n## Ray-Ban's many features, ranked and rated\nCredit: Robyn Johnson\nThe Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a ton of features, and they're not equally useful, so here's a quick feature list, organized from the ones I used most to ones I used least:\n**The camera:** Ray-Ban Metas' essential feature for me is the camera. It's weird to think of a smart phone camera as being inconvenient, but reaching in your pocket, unlocking the screen, clicking an app, and putting it up to your face is a lot of steps compared to pinching the arm of your glasses. The other way to turn on the camera, saying \"Hey Meta, take a picture\" or \"Hey Meta, take video,\" can be incredibly useful too, as it lets you take videos while riding a bike and listening to Hawkwind, like so: \n> While I found the quality of the photos to be surprisingly good, these glasses are best for casual snaps. There's no viewfinder, and if you're going for super high quality, or want to shoot in low-light situations, they won't replace a \"real\" camera. \n**Text and calls:** Getting a text and replying by voice is great when your hands are full. Initiating or responding to texts while driving is amazing and will probably save some people's lives. Call quality is solid, and the voice recognition is excellent, even in traffic or crowds. It's easy to use too, since you can just say \"Hey Meta, how do I send a text?\" if you forget.\n**Music** : Halfway down the list is the perfect time to talk about the Ray-Ban Meta's music and audio. It is mid. The sound quality isn't terrible, but it's podcast-while-cooking level. If you're into music at all, you'll quickly grow tired of the tinny sounds from the Ray-Ban meta glasses and throw in some ear buds. On the plus side, the ability to control Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music with just your voice is great. Saying \"Hey Meta, play some funk\" and having The Meters start playing is cool. \n**Meta AI** : Depending on your point of view, Meta's AI is the either the killer app or the Trojan horse of these glasses, but I almost never use it. When I first got the glasses, I was blown away by saying \"Hey Meta, look\" and having it describe what I was seeing accurately. But that wears off after eight minutes. Then, I started using it to clown on my friends by looking at their car or something and saying, \"Hey, Meta, is this a nice car?\" and relaying the answer. (Sadly, it won't roast _people_.) That was fun for three minutes. Then, I changed [Meta's voice to Awkwafina](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/meta-ray-bans-celebrity-voices-rated-from-least-to-most-annoying). That was fun for 38 seconds. Then, I stopped using it altogether. Maybe your life is different, but mine is fine without an AI assistant. \n**Translation:** Meta recently rolled out the ability to translate from Spanish, French, and Italian to English, and vice-versa. This is too new to really rate, but my initial reaction to testing it out with a Spanish speaking pal was \"santa mierda!\"__ It's _really_ good, and was able to translate spoken words at a conversational rate in real time, with a surprisingly amount of accuracy. It's like having a universal translator from Star Trek or something. \n## What I'd like to see from Ray-Ban Meta glasses\nCredit: Stephen Johnson\nThese glasses are creeping toward being a true digital assistant, but they're not there. I want to say \"Hey, Meta, book me a cheap hotel in Yonkers next weekend\" and have it _just_ _happen_. Right now, though, the glasses are limited to controlling music, sending messages, translating language in real time, and providing basic information--which is a lot for a pair of glasses.\n## Privacy concerns (as if privacy still exists)\nMeta recently sent an email to Ray-Ban Meta users that said, in part, \"Meta AI with camera use is always enabled on your glasses unless you turn off 'Hey Meta,'\" and \"the option to disable voice recordings storage is no longer available.\" Basically, Meta is vowing to look at what I'm looking at and store whatever I say, so you could argue there are some pretty big __ privacy concerns. It's not great, but honestly, I'm too boring to care. If Meta wants hours of footage of me folding laundry or playing _Oblivion Remastered,_ that's their problem.\nIf you're someone that does prioritize your privacy though, these glasses are probably not the product for you. \n## Are they worth the price?\nWhether something is \"worth it\" really depends on the customer. But $299 seems like a good deal for a camera, AI agent, Bluetooth headset, and sunglasses, and if you're going for prescription Ray-Ban Metas, it's amazing. All told, these were actually cheaper than my regular glasses, and I can't ask my regular glasses to tell me a joke. \n## The bottom line\nI'm not a Meta fanboy by any stretch, but credit where it's due: these glasses are _really good_. The novelty wears off, but the usefulness doesn't. Unlike most gadgets, they've earned their spot in my semi-daily rotation. If they could shave a little more weight off, they'd be my everyday specs.",

It's not quite iPad-level quality, but it gets close, especially for reading, streaming, or even casual drawing with the [optional $36.99 stylus](https://zdcs.link/QxANdk?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=optional%20%2436.99%20stylus&short_url=QxANdk&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"). The aluminum build adds a bit of a premium touch, and the stereo speakers are surprisingly solid for something at this price. There's no headphone jack (which feels like a miss), but Bluetooth 5.3 is stable for [wireless headsets](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-bluetooth-headsets \"open in a new window\"). Internally, it's running on 4GB RAM and a processor that keeps things snappy. You can browse, download, and play light games without the usual budget-tablet lag. You can expand storage beyond the already generous 128GB via [microSD](https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-microsd-card-deals-for-prime-day) (sold separately) up to 1 TB.\nThat said, it still runs FireOS 8, which is Amazon's custom take on Android. If you're already tied into Kindle, Prime Video, and Audible, it makes sense. But if you rely on Google apps or want Play Store access out of the box, it's not the most open system--you'll have to sideload apps manually, notes this [PCMag review](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-fire-max-11 \"open in a new window\"). Camera-wise, it's nothing to write home about: It's got two 8MP shooters that are fine for Zoom calls or document scans, but not much else. Battery life also doesn't quite live up to the advertised 14 hours; you're more likely to get around eight to 10 hours, depending on what you're doing. The tablet charges via USB-C and technically supports 15W charging, but Amazon ships it with a slower 9W adapter. Still, for under $150, it's hard to find a tablet with a screen this good and that much storage.\nAmazon also sells some solid accessories to go with it. There's a [magnetic slim cover](https://zdcs.link/z3GPgm?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=magnetic%20slim%20cover&short_url=z3GPgm&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") for $49.99 that makes it easier to carry around without scratching the screen, and a matte [anti-glare screen protector](https://zdcs.link/9yDoBe?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=anti-glare%20screen%20protector&short_url=9yDoBe&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") for $17.99 if you're reading outside or just hate smudges. And if you want to turn the Fire Max 11 into a basic productivity setup, the $84.99 [keyboard case](https://zdcs.link/z7OyqV?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=keyboard%20case&short_url=z7OyqV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") snaps on magnetically and works well for emails or notes.",

The Federal Trade Commission is [alerting consumers](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/04/dont-pay-get-your-employer-identification-number-ein \"open in a new window\") to fraudulent websites that are claiming to be associated with the IRS and charging up to $300 to file paperwork for obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN). \nThe EIN application is available for free [on the real IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/get-an-employer-identification-number \"open in a new window\") and requires just a few minutes to complete. An EIN, which is a corporate identifier for filing taxes, is required for anyone opening a business, estate, or nonprofit as well as those with household employees (such as a family hiring a nanny). \n## How the EIN scam works\nThe services identified by the FTC are impersonating the IRS or misrepresenting their affiliation in one or more of the following ways: \n  * Using IRS seals, logos, formatting, colors, fonts, layouts, and imagery on their websites and ads\n  * Using \"IRS\" in their domain names or on their websites\n  * Using the term \"EIN Assistant\" \n  * Failing to disclose that they are not affiliated with the IRS\n  * Failing to disclose that payments are 100% service fees, as EINs are free\n\n\nThis also isn't the only way scammers are profiting off of \"helping\" consumers apply for government services.

(Note that TSA PreCheck contracts with [several third-party enrollment providers](https://www.tsa.gov/precheck \"open in a new window\"), with total fees varying slightly from $67 to $78.)\n## How to apply for an EIN--for free\nIf you do need an EIN, you can complete the application using the IRS' [EIN Assistant tool](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp \"open in a new window\"). You'll need to provide information about the legal structure of your business as well as personal information like your name, address, contact information, and tax ID. \nYour EIN is generated immediately upon completion and verification, and the whole process takes fewer than 15 minutes if you have all of your information ready.",

    "title": "All the Gardening Tasks I’m Tackling in May",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "There is no place more joyous than a garden center in May. The shelves are full of annuals, vegetables, and perennials ready to go home with you. Gardeners everywhere are waiting with bated breath, trying to find the perfect day to get plants in the ground. Pops of color are emerging as tulips, irises, peonies, and lilacs fill yards. \nWhat you do this month will determine how successful your summer garden is, so strap into your overalls, grab your sunhat and spade, and get outside. Let's install a summer garden. I'll go over the maintenance tasks you should tackle first, then get into the details on what you should plant and how to do it.\n## Perform a few garden maintenance tasks first\nYour watering systems may have taken a hit during winter, so it's vital to check each line before you turn on irrigation for the summer. Often, I've found that I am the problem, having nicked lines while weeding or digging around in spring. \nEnsure that the controller is working by standing outside, testing each zone and walking around to check each end point. You can usually hear a leak, so keep an ear out for loud gushing or hissing while also scanning visually. \nIf you use a hose bib setup, check that as well. We've had a hot spell early on the west coast, meaning my irrigation went on earlier than ever this year. (For plants growing in full sun, water in the morning and aim for 1 to 2 inches of water per week.)\nCredit: Amanda Blum\nYour established beds can benefit from a layer of compost, which will act as a general fertilizer, as well as create volume back in your beds if they've experienced erosion during the winter. Follow the compost with a layer of [mulch](https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-keep-your-garden-well-mulched). Spending this time spreading the compost and mulch will give you the opportunity to size up each part of your garden, so take notes as you go for which areas need weeding, are experiencing pests, or have plants that look like they might not have survived the winter. \n## Shrubs, trees, and vines\nA number of shrubs go through blooming cycles in spring, like lilac and forsythia. Once they've bloomed, you can prune them back, and in some cases, like lilac, this may trigger a second bloom later in the season. In either case, it will take one fall task off your list and keep the garden looking tidier. \nLilac in bloom. Credit: Amanda Blum\nThis is a good time to plant new woody shrubs and trees--the weather is mild and the ground should be soft from the rains. For your existing trees, make sure you feed them with a fertilizer that is appropriate for them this month. Your garden center can help identify which fertilizer is best for the trees you have. Each of these trees will be creating shoots this month, and you should prune them back as necessary to maintain the shape of the tree and to keep fruit to an amount the tree can reasonably support. \nEnsure you are only using clean pruners or loppers--carry diluted bleach or Lysol with you in a spray bottle while outside. Cleaning your tools in between plants ensures that you do not transmit virus, fungus or disease between plants.\nClematis plant climbing the wall. Credit: Amanda Blum\nFinally, climbing perennial vines like clematis, roses, and honeysuckle should be coming out of their slumber at this point, and you'll want to ensure you're supporting them by tying them loosely to their trellises as they climb. \n## Annual flowers\nAnnuals at the nursery. Credit: Amanda Blum\nIt is finally time to put some annuals in the ground, which provide pops of color and can last all summer if you treat them right. \nGarden centers should be full of annuals at this point of the year, including petunias, lobelia, marigolds, and begonias. Annuals are a bit more tender than perennials, so you want to wait until you are past the risk of freezing to plant. Annuals can fill an area with color in the space and time between perennials blooming, and are ideal for window boxes and planters, where it might be hard for annuals to survive the winter. \nMost hanging baskets have annuals for the same reason--they're too exposed for perennials or anything else to survive winter. Make sure that the beds you're planting into have a slow release fertilizer like Osmacote in them, and that they will get regularly watered. \n## Perennial flowers\nMost people will have tulips in bloom or just completed at this point--remember not to cut them down after bloom. Tulips need their leaves in order to come back next year, so let them compost in place. Once the foliage has yellowed, it's OK to divide or move the bulbs. Once the tulip has bloomed, it's a great time for a bulb fertilizer, so they'll be strong next year. You can also plant summer bulbs like dahlias and cannas now, if the risk of frost is gone.\nYou can divide irises now. Credit: Amanda Blum\nIf you didn't get new perennials planted in April, you can still do so now, or divide the perennials you have. The ground should be very workable now, and you may be noticing which plants are ready to be divided as you move about the garden. If you'd like them to bloom this summer, you'll want to get this task done in May. As you plant, ensure you're using slow release fertilizer in the ground where you plant. \nThis time of year, be vigilant in checking your garden center, grocer, and anywhere else that has a \"sad plant shelf\" (SPS). Stores will [discount these plants ](https://lifehacker.com/why-those-half-dead-plants-are-actually-a-good-deal-1850547546)that don't look especially happy at 50% off or more, and because they're perennials, that's a deal. Plant them as you would any other, and while they might not come back this year, they will next year. Delphiniums and agastache are my favorite SPS finds. \nYour roses need a spring fertilizer and might need some shaping at this point or help attaching to the trellis. Look for signs of stress or pests and ensure you're treating them with appropriate treatments. Your garden center can help. \n## Vegetables\nOnto the main event! Gardeners across the country wait for the precise moment to put their tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants into the ground, and sometime this month, that day will arrive. Here on the west coast, it's usually Mother's Day, but what you're actually waiting for is steady overnight temps over 50 degrees. \nIf in doubt, join a local gardening group, because this will be the main topic of conversation this time of year. That means it's time to begin [hardening off](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-move-your-seedlings-outside-without-killing-them-1850346123) vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants as appropriate. \nCredit: Amanda Blum\nPerennial vegetables like asparagus and artichokes should be active now. Remember to harvest asparagus daily, taking only spears that are larger than your pinky. Once spears become thinner, it's time to leave the plant alone for next year. Watch your artichoke plants for ants or aphid infestations, which may be sprayed off, but will return without further treatment like neem oil or nearby trap flowers like nasturtiums. Both asparagus beds and artichokes will benefit from a spring fertilizer. \nNasturtiums are excellent trap plants. Credit: Amanda Blum\nBy mid to late May, almost all regions should be planting their warm weather crops. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers, but also beans, corn, cucumbers, and everything else. Your beans and corn can be direct seeded, as can melon, pumpkin, and both winter and summer squash, but using starts will give you a leg up for the summer. \nIf you planted potatoes in the spring, it's likely time to [hill up](https://awaytogarden.com/growing-potatoes-organically-when-and-how-to-plant-hill-and-harvest/#:~:text=Hilling%20brings%20loose%20soil%20around,the%20top%20leaves%20are%20exposed. \"open in a new window\") earth around the sprouts. \nStrawberry plants that need to be thinned. Credit: Amanda Blum\nThin out your strawberry beds of [runners](https://strawberryplants.org/what-are-strawberry-runners-stolons/ \"open in a new window\") and give your strawberry beds a dusting of fertilizer. Strawberry plants can either focus their energy on producing these runners or on fruit, but aren't very good at doing both. Each spring the beds must be thinned to create better and larger fruit. You can give away the runners or plant them elsewhere. \n## Pest control\nReduce snail and slug populations by putting out traps and going on regular evening hunts. Doing this now, as the rains cease, will greatly reduce problems later this summer. Hang pheromone traps in your fruit trees now, which will control pests this summer and protect your fruit.",

    "title": "How QLED and OLED Displays Work, and Which Is Right for You",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Of all the confusing display tech terms, few are easier to mix up than OLED and QLED. Barely half a letter separates them, but they work very differently, and those differences can matter a lot when it comes to the quality of your TV or monitor. Let's break down the differences, and why you should care when display shopping.\nThere are a lot of sub-categories in both of these display types, but for the purposes of this article, I'm going to mainly focus on the core distinctions between these two main groups. It's also worth pointing out that while you may sometimes see OLED panels in smartphones, there aren't any QLED smartphones just yet.\n## OLED vs. QLED: The simple version\nIf you're TV shopping and just need the briefest breakdown, here it is: OLED displays use pixels that emit their own light individually, which provides perfect blacks, greater contrast, and vivid displays, but a greater risk of picture burn-in. OLED displays typically struggle to be as bright as competing display tech, and can have a shorter lifespan (though it's still typically measured in many years).\nMeanwhile, QLED displays use a blue backlight and \"quantum dot\" pixels to turn that light into red, green, or blue light. This allows QLED displays to be much brighter than OLED, making it easier to see in sunny rooms with a lot of natural lighting. They're also less prone to burn-in, though they're usually thicker than OLED (making them ill-suited for smartphones) and have worse black levels.\nEasy, right? Well, it can get a bit more complicated than that, so let's dive deeper.\n## How do OLED displays work?\nTypical liquid crystal display (LCD) screens use a backlight shining through liquid crystals that filter the color of the backlight to create each pixel's hue. The downside to this technique is that those liquid crystals can't fully block the backlight, which is why even when your monitor shows a completely black screen, it still looks \"on.\"\nOrganic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays get around this problem by using pixels that light up individually, with no backlight required. This means that if a part of the screen displays pure black, those pixels will just be off. At that point, the only light coming from that part of the screen will be any ambient light bouncing off of it.\n## Why should I get an OLED display?\nThere are several advantages to this type of display:\n  * **Perfect black levels and incredible contrast:** Since there's no backlight, black levels on OLED displays are technically perfect. Or, more accurately, they're as dark as the room you're watching in. It also means that the contrast between dark and light parts of the screen can be much, much higher. \n  * **Wide viewing angles:** Since you're looking at pixels that are effectively a series of tiny lights without any filters, there are fewer issues with viewing angles. You can watch an OLED TV from way off to the side and still see it clearly.\n  * **Thinner displays:** Since OLEDs don't require a separate backlight, the displays can be made super thin. Many smartphones use this type of display, for exactly this (and other) reasons.\n  * **Lower power consumption (sometimes):** Technically, OLED displays consume more power to reach similar levels of uniform brightness compared to LCDs, however, the per-pixel lighting means they don't always need to. Some smartphones take advantage of this by offering minimal ambient displays that light up a few pixels to show the time or notifications while keeping the rest of the display dark to save power. This also means, in some cases, [_switching to dark mode_](https://lifehacker.com/embrace-evil-by-enabling-dark-mode-in-every-app-1845497287) can actually make your phone last a bit longer.\n\n\nThat said, there are some downsides to OLEDs as well. The biggest issue is burn-in. While modern OLEDs have gotten better at handling this, images that stay on your screen for long periods of time (like menus, taskbars, or lower-thirds) can leave \"ghosts\" of the image that persist even when they're no longer being shown. \nThey also cost more than LCDs, and that cost scales the bigger the display. For smartphones, that might not be a big deal (even some budget phones have OLED panels now), but for TVs that can mean several hundred or thousands of dollars for the biggest screens. Since OLED displays can also have a shorter lifespan, it's worth considering before making a huge investment.\n## How do QLEDs work, and what are quantum dots?\nSo, what makes Quantum Light Emitting Diode (QLED) displays different? To explain that, we need to talk about quantum dots. Without getting _too_ deep into the physics of how they work, quantum dots are nanoparticles that emit different colored light based on how large they are (on an atomic scale).\nIn practice, QLED displays start with a blue backlight--since blue light has the shortest wavelength and thus highest energy--which then hits the quantum dot layer. This layer contains a mixture of quantum dots sized to produce either green or red light when struck by the backlight. \nThis subtle distinction can make a big difference when creating vivid, bright displays. With white backlights, all color wavelengths are present, and LCDs create specific colors by blocking the light the wavelengths that aren't needed. In a quantum dot display, you only need to start with blue light, then let the quantum dot layer essentially \"slow\" it down to red or green wavelengths.\n## So, why should I get a QLED display?\nThis process is more energy efficient than using pure white backlights, which means it can make colors that are much more saturated and vivid than regular LCD displays. It still doesn't achieve the pure black levels of OLED displays, but it can result in much better contrast than LCD displays without a quantum dot layer.\nAlso, notice how I keep saying \"LCD display\"? That's right, despite \"QLED\" sounding similar to \"OLED,\" they're still LCD panels. The blue backlights are LEDs, but these displays still use an LCD layer to filter light. Some manufacturers have started using quantum dots on OLED panels, and those are called QD-OLED. Which isn't confusing _at all_.\nQLED displays have some useful advantages compared to OLED panels. Including: \n  * **High peak brightness:** QLED TVs can get much brighter than comparable OLED displays, making them best suited for large, bright rooms. If you have a lot of windows in your living room, for example, you might want one of these.\n  * **A wide, vibrant color gamut:** Since quantum dots reproduce colors more efficiently, you can get really vibrant and accurate colors from a QLED panel. This is great [_for high-dynamic range content_](https://lifehacker.com/what-hdr-is-and-why-it-s-the-future-of-television-1785641937) that makes all your colorful movies and shows really pop.\n  * **No risk of burn-in:** QLED displays don't suffer from burn-in issues since the inorganic quantum dots don't degrade like OLED pixels can. This also leads to a longer lifespan for your TV overall.\n  * **Larger TVs for lower costs:** Generally speaking, OLED TVs can get _super_ pricey when you start looking at bigger sizes. QLEDs, however, will usually be more accessible without sacrificing size.\n\n\nOne of the biggest downsides of QLED TVs compared to OLED is that some models have shorter viewing angles, meaning your friend on the far side of the couch might have a worse view. Some TV manufacturers use features like local dimming--basically, making the backlight dimmer for darker parts of the image--to improve black levels, but those will vary by manufacturer.\nTo make matters more confusing, some manufacturers use quantum dots for their LCD displays, but don't _call_ them \"QLED.\" Hisense, for example, uses the ULED label. The company says this term refers to a \"special sauce\" of different TV technologies, but that combination includes quantum dots with an LED backlight and LCD matrix.\nIt's annoying to get lost in the marketing jargon, but if you're looking for a bright TV that can compete with the sunshine coming through your windows, QLED TVs are gonna be your best bet. Otherwise, if you prefer really deep contrast, usually watch in a darker room, and maybe have a bit too much money to spend, OLED TVs will be more your speed.",

    "content": "I couldn't live without copy and paste--it's core to the way I write and work--but it's a pretty abstract feature when you think about it. Copy something and it goes... somewhere. Then you can paste it. Oh, and if you copy a second thing the first thing is gone.\nThis is a problem solved by [clipboard managers](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-copy-more-than-one-thing-to-your-clipboard-at-a-1848711373). These applications let you review everything you've copied recently and even select an older item to paste it. They work well, but generally require a lot of context switching. What if you want to copy multiple things and then paste them later, all in the order you copied them, without having to open a clipboard manager and choose the items in order? There's a free and open source Mac tool for that: [Batch Clipboard](https://github.com/jpmhouston/Cleepp/wiki/About-Batch-Clipboard-for-macOS \"open in a new window\") (which I found via [MacMenuBar](https://macmenubar.com/batch-clipboard/ \"open in a new window\")).\nThis application isn't a clipboard manager--in fact, it can easily be used alongside one. With the application running, you can copy text, images, or files using the keyboard shortcut **Cmd-Control-C** to start building a batch. When you're ready, you can paste them, one at a time starting at the beginning of the batch, using the keyboard shortcut **Cmd-Control-V**. You can click the menu bar icon at any time to see the current batch.\nIt takes a second to wrap your head around, but is quite useful in certain contexts. If, for example, you're reading a document and want to collect a few quotes, you can copy each one to your batch and them paste them all to your notes in sequence, taking the time to add a bit of context as you go. This allows you to focus on reading instead of constantly switching back and forth between the source document and your notes.\nCredit: Justin Pot\nGetting started is simple. After downloading the app, you can launch it to read the quick start guide--it will talk you through using the application and ask you to enable permissions. You can access the settings by clicking the menu bar icon and clicking \"Settings\". You can customize the keyboard shortcuts, decide whether the application start when your computer does, and change how many history items are visible in the menu. You can also choose for the application to ignore items copied from particular applications.\nYou could, in theory, use Batch Clipboard as an alternative to a clipboard manager--click the menu bar icon while holding the **Option** key and you can review everything you copied recently. You could also use it alongside a dedicated clipboard manager, or just open it when you specifically want to use the batch copying feature. Check it out if clipboard managers have never quite clicked with you.",

    "content": "You likely update devices like your smartphone or laptop fairly frequently. (Perhaps you've put the latest one off a little longer than you should.) But how often are you updating other types of devices, like your TV?\nDespite how routine and simple your TV use may be, it can be important to keep the tube, like other devices, updated to the latest software and firmware version. And while many smart TVs routinely check for the latest updates, it's possible yours doesn't. I don't keep my TV connected to the internet, for example, so there's no way for me to check for updates via wifi. \nYou don't need to hook your TV up to your network to update it, however, nor do you need a TV that will look for updates on its own. As a matter of fact, one of your TV's overlooked ports can help keep it fully up to date, [as ZDNet's Chris Bayer explains](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/your-tvs-usb-port-has-a-forgotten-benefit-that-can-make-an-old-system-feel-new-again/ \"open in a new window\"). \n## How to update your TV over USB\nTo start, you'll need three items: a TV (to update), a computer (to download the update), and a USB drive (to store the update). \nFirst, figure out what TV you actually have. It isn't necessarily enough to just know the brand, since that company may make many different types of TVs. You'll want to grab your particular TV's model number to make sure you're pulling the most recent update available for that model. \nIf you have your TV mounted or backed up to a wall, it might be a bit tricky to find, since the model number is usually on a sticker on the back of your TV. If you can, pull your TV as far out as you safely can, and use a flashlight or your smartphone camera to locate the sticker with the identification number. You can also see if your TV has its model number in its settings menu. This may be in an \"About\" or \"General\" menu. \nOnce you know your TV's model number, head to the manufacturer's site and look for the downloads section. For example, for an LG TV, you'll find this in the \"Support\" section under \"Software & Drivers for Downloading.\" When asked, enter your model number, and the site should take you to the list of available software to download. You'll want to make sure you're choosing the most recent download available, as well as the one for your region, as you don't want to install the wrong software on your TV. \nOnce you find the right software version, download it to your computer. If it arrives as a ZIP file, you can either click it to unzip (Mac), or right-click and choose \"Extract All\" (Windows). Once you have access to the files (which should appear as .bin or .img files), connect a USB stick to your computer and move the files to the drive, making sure to add the files to the main drive and not any of the folders that might be on it. Choose to eject the drive from your Mac or PC before physically removing it from your computer.\nFinally, plug the USB stick into your TV. If your TV doesn't automatically register the update file on the stick, head to your TV's settings and look for \"update\" language, like \"Software Update\" or \"Firmware Update.\" Your TV should walk you through the proper steps. \n## If the update didn't work, format the drive\nOne possible issue with this method concerns the USB drive itself. If it isn't properly formatted (to FAT32), your TV may not recognize it. \nYou can format the drive on either Windows or Mac, but note that formatting requires erasing everything on the drive. If you have any essential data on your drive, back it up somewhere else first, or choose another drive to work with. \nIf the drive is small enough, you can format it [through Windows' Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0No8NzWSSXo&t=60s \"open in a new window\"). Right-click on the drive, then choose **Format**. Here, choose **FAT32** under \"File system,\" then check **Quick Format**. Click **Start** , click **OK** on the pop-up that warns you you will lose all data on the drive, and you're set. \nOn Mac, plug your drive in, then open Disk Utility. Choose **Erase** , then choose **MS-DOS (FAT)** from the \"Format\" drop down. Now, click **Erase** , then choose **Done** when finished.",

Whether it's worry over higher prices and empty store shelves or more generalized [economic anxiety](https://lifehacker.com/tech/should-you-buy-new-tech-before-tariffs-raise-prices), these certainly are exciting times. And, like clockwork, we can add one more thing to worry about in relation to tariffs: Scams.\nPivoting off the chaos and uncertainty everyone is experiencing around the on-again, off-again tariffs and their constantly shifting parameters, scammers have quickly assembled a few new attacks on your bank account. They count on the fact that most of us aren't economists or experienced with import/export law, so it can be easy to frighten or intimidate us into forking over money, especially because the one thing most of us know about tariffs is that they're going to cost us money. Here are the tariff scams you need to be on alert for--and how to spot them.\n## Fake government emails\nOne new scam attempts to leverage people's unfamiliarity with tariffs by posing as government agencies seeking tariff payments directly from consumers. Several hundred websites have been created since the beginning of the year, many with deceptive names including terms like \"U.S. Customs\" or \"Tariffs\" in hopes of convincing you they're legitimate [organs of the government](https://lifehacker.com/money/fbi-isnt-calling-to-help-you-recover-from-fraud). The scammers then send out emails from those official-looking domains claiming that you owe a tariff payment for something you bought recently, or that you owe a general tariff payment.\nSometimes the scammer's goal is to get you to make a payment, but often it's just to collect your information via an official-looking form.\n**How to spot it:** First, always keep in mind that consumers don't pay tariffs directly--if the costs are passed on to you, it's through higher prices. Any request for a direct tariff payment is almost certainly a scam. Any official government website will have a [\".gov\" extension](https://lifehacker.com/tech/find-deleted-government-websites), so you should be suspicious of any \".com\" or \".net\" sites claiming to be associated with the government. You can also use what's known as a [WHOIS lookup](https://www.whois.com/whois/ \"open in a new window\") to see when a web domain was registered. Any site created within the last few months should be considered extremely suspicious.\n## Fake messages about mail and packages\nAnother way scammers will try to leverage tariff confusion against you is by pretending to be a major shipping company like FedEx or UPS. They'll send you an email claiming that you have [a package](https://lifehacker.com/money/free-amazon-package-brushing-scam) being held because a tariff is owed, and direct you to a scam sight to pay to have the package released. This is a twist on an old scam, but uncertainty over who owes tariffs gives it a fresh sheen of legitimacy. \n**How to spot it:** Simply reminding yourself that you should never pay a tariff directly is key--any request from a shipping company or the [United States Post Office](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-that-package-delivery-text-is-a-scam-1850827391) for a tariff-related fee is a scam, full stop. If you actually have packages coming and you're at all uncertain of their status, always verify details separately by going to the shipper's main website and entering tracking information there, or contacting their customer service.\n## Factory shopping\nIf you're a consumer on a budget--and who isn't these days--you might be excited to stumble on a social media post or email purporting to sell you stuff directly from factories in China or other countries without a tariff. [They claim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/15/viral-tiktok-chinese-manufacturers-tariffs/ \"open in a new window\") that the stuff is the same as name-brand clothing or other items, just without the branding, making them cheaper to offset any tariff-driven price increases. These sites are often pushed by so-called influencers on platforms like [TikTok](https://lifehacker.com/money/signs-a-political-donation-is-a-scam), who gush about avoiding tariff fees.\nOf course, once you receive your items--assuming you actually do--they're almost certainly [counterfeit](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-avoid-counterfeit-products-on-amazon) and probably pretty crappy in terms of quality. And you won't have the benefit of the brand's customer service to fall back on, either.\n**How to spot it:** Anyone claiming they can circumvent tariffs is probably lying to you, and the old rule about things being too good to be true (i.e., they probably aren't) always applies. If you see a post or video purporting to show a foreign factory selling items directly to consumers, it's almost certainly a scam.\n## Fake tariff relief payments\nAll this talk of skyrocketing prices has made everyone understandably nervous about paying their bills. This has led to a version of a scam that's been popular ever since the pandemic stimulus checks went out: Fake relief payments.\nAdvertisements are showing up on social media claiming that there are various \"tariff relief\" payments going out, offering anywhere from $750 to $5,600. These are supposedly government programs to help us all survive the new reality of tariffs, and in the wake of previous government bailouts and stimulus payments they can seem plausible at first glance. Of course, if you click on any of these ads you'll find yourself at a phishing site demanding every bit of sensitive information the scammers can think of.\n**How to spot it:** Since these usually pop up in the form of paid ads on platforms like Facebook, they will usually be marked as \"sponsored\" in some way--if you see an indication that it's a paid ad, ignore it. If the government were to send out some sort of tariff-related stimulus, it wouldn't require you to fill out forms--like previous stimulus payments, it would rely on the reams of data it already has on you thanks to the IRS. And a tariff stimulus would be in the news. A lot. If you're tempted to believe something like this, look for headlines on legitimate news sites--if you don't see any, assume it's a scam.\n## Investment scams\nScammers are always trying to play off two things: Fear and greed. While there have always been investment scams involving fake accounts or dubious cryptocurrencies, the newest versions of these scams play on everyone's fear of economic turmoil, claiming that a new investment product--typically in the cryptocurrency sphere--offers a risk-free safe haven from tariff chaos. While economies and national currencies might falter as trade wars escalate, the pitch goes, this nifty new version of money is unaffected by tariffs or other traditional economic factors and offers steady returns. Naturally, if you actually contact these sites and make an investment, your money simply vanishes, or you're pulled into a [Pig Butchering scam](https://lifehacker.com/don-t-fall-for-the-pig-butchering-scam-1849769412) complete with a fake website showing you incredible returns on your investment that you will never actually be able to withdraw.\n**How to spot it:** The most obvious sign of a scam investment is an unrealistic rate of return. Any investment that \"guarantees\" no risk of loss and a huge profit in a short time is almost always a scam. If it involves a cryptocurrency you've never heard of, you should definitely be suspicious. An increasingly common sign of a tariff-related crypto scam is a fake \"endorsement\" from a political figure--a scam targeting nervous Canadian investors, for example, [used fake testimonials from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-scam-lure-victim-trade-war-fears-canada-securities-regulators \"open in a new window\") and other officials to fool people. Government officials typically don't endorse investments, and you should absolutely fact-check any you see without relying on links provided by the site itself.",

    "content": "The average total consumer household debt last year was $105,056--a 13% increase over the past five years, [according to the most recent data](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/consumer-debt-study/ \"open in a new window\"). When it comes to researching strategies and tips for paying off your balances, it's easy to get lost down a rabbit hole. And that rabbit hole can distract you from the real work of getting organized and tackling your debt. \nTaking the first steps toward a clear plan and system in place--even just reading this article--can help you feel more in control and start to make some progress toward being debt-free. If you're worried and feeling overwhelmed by debt, here are initial steps to take so you can get organized and make some real progress. \n## Know what you owe\nBefore you can tackle your debt, you need a complete picture of what you're facing. Here are the first actionable steps you can take:\n  * Gather all statements for every debt you have (credit cards, student loans, medical bills, personal loans).\n  * Create a master list with the creditor name, balance, interest rate, minimum payment, and due date for each debt.\n  * Check your credit reports to ensure you haven't missed any debts.\n  * Keep this information in one accessible place--a [spreadsheet](https://lifehacker.com/these-spreadsheet-tricks-make-budgeting-fun-1850297820), [notebook](https://lifehacker.com/money/notion-app-personal-finance-tools-review), or [budgeting app.](https://lifehacker.com/the-best-budgeting-apps-based-on-your-savings-goals-1850419365)\n\n\n## List out your interest rates\nIn order to prioritize your debts, list them out by [interest rates](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-interest-calculated-on-credit-cards). If you can't rattle off yours, it's time to log into your accounts or check your latest statement to pinpoint your interest rate for each and every balance you carry. Doing this now can help you strategize to get that debt paid off faster. \n## Choose a payoff method\nOnce you know your interest rates, you can [strategize your payoff plan](https://lifehacker.com/money/debt-avalanche-or-debt-snowball-method-to-pay-off-debt) with either the snowball method or the avalanche method.\nThe **avalanche method** prioritizes high-interest debt first, helping you pay less interest in the long run by knocking out debts with higher interest rates as soon as possible. The main benefit of the debt avalanche is that it saves you the most money in the long run by targeting the most expensive debt first. This can be especially helpful if you have one or two debts with significantly higher interest rates than the others. Knocking those out first can make a big dent in the total amount you owe. \nThe **snowball method** , on the other hand, focuses on paying off your debts in order of smallest balance to largest. The idea is that getting \"wins\" by paying off smaller debts quickly can provide much-needed motivation to keep going. The main benefit of the debt snowball is the psychological boost you get from crossing debts off your list one by one. This can be incredibly powerful, especially if you have a lot of smaller debts that feel overwhelming. Paying them off in quick succession can give you the momentum to keep tackling the larger debts.\n## Never miss a payment\nEven if you only make the minimum payment on your balances to start, make sure you pay each and every bill on time, every time. Missing that due date could result in both a late fee and a penalty APR, meaning you could pay up to 30% interest for a while instead of your normal interest rate. Dealing with that penalty interest rate could set your payoff plans back in a major way.\nTo make it easier to avoid payment disasters, set up [_automatic payments_](https://lifehacker.com/money/stagger-automated-payments). You can always make additional payments when you're able to pay more than the minimum, or adjust the amount for your monthly payments. And if your debt is in a balance transfer promotional period (more on that in the next slide), you'll want to make sure you can pay off your entire balance during that zero-interest period.\n## Consolidate your debt or transfer your balance\nIf you're having a hard time paying more than the minimum on your debts, consider taking steps to reduce your interest rates. There are two main ways you can do this if you don't feel like calling every one of your creditors to haggle:\n**Consolidate:** Debt consolidation makes sense if you can save money over the long term by securing a better interest rate, or if streamlining will be what allows you to make payments on time. And remember, [consolidated debt](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-and-when-to-consolidate-your-credit-card-debt) is still debt that needs to be paid off as quickly as possible.\n**Transfer:** Check with your credit card issuer for [_zero-interest balance transfer_](https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-credit-card-balance-transfer) offers, which allow you to transfer in your balance from another source of debt to your current account. Zero-interest offer periods can last anywhere between nine and 18 months.\n## Forget about earning rewards\nRewards earnings setups and signup bonuses have a special way of getting people to spend more than they bargained for. If you're in debt, now isn't the time to try to optimize your credit card use to earn maximum rewards. This is especially important if you have cards that charge annual fees. \nIf you have some rewards cards in your wallet, convert your balance to statement credit to help put a dent in your balance.\n## Ask for help if you get stuck\nIf you're having a hard time paying your minimum debt payments because of a financial hardship like a job loss, you can ask your creditor if it has a customer assistance program. You may be able to [_defer your payments_](https://lifehacker.com/get-all-your-credit-card-payments-deferred-with-one-cal-1843137590) for a few months while you get back on track.\nYou can also get a second opinion on your debt payoff plan, whether your monthly budget is in dire straits or you're just feeling stuck. [Credit counseling organizations](https://lifehacker.com/money/when-to-use-debt-counseling-services) are typically non-profit groups that provide a range of money management services and educational resources to consumers. Their counselors are certified professionals who can give you expert, unbiased guidance on how to handle your specific financial situation. All the money you pay goes directly toward your debts, but there may be costs to use such a program. There's often a setup fee of up to $75 and an ongoing monthly fee of between $25 and $75.\n## Prepare for setbacks\nLife happens--stay organized even when challenges arise. Know which bills could be temporarily reduced if finances get tight, and have contact information ready for creditors if you need to request hardship accommodations. Review and adjust your plan quarterly to stay realistic and on track.\nGetting organized isn't a one-time event but an ongoing process that supports your financial goals. With these systems in place, you'll build momentum to pay off your debt once and for all.",

If you didn't already know, it's not just for blending already cooked soup. You can actually _cook_ with the blender. It might take a moment to wrap your head around the idea, but personally, I had to see for myself to become fully convinced. Here's how to do it. \n## How can a blender cook soup?\nIt turns out, if you have an engine powerful enough, you can create enough friction with the blender's blades to heat up a few pints of liquid ingredients until it's well into cooking temperature (140°F to 190°F) and fully billowing steam. While you're not cooking with fire, you do have a heat source, and the ingredients get chopped into such minuscule pieces that they take only a moment to cook once they reach the correct temperature. \nNot all blenders are equipped to pull this off. I've heard harrowing experiences of soup flying out of blender containers, or blades wearing out at high speeds, but all Vitamix blenders are equipped to run at speed 10 (the highest speed) for over seven minutes straight. And that's exactly what you need to get your soup up to cooking temperature. \nIf you have been wanting a Vitamix but haven't wanted to shell out the money, check out the company's surprisingly good [Mother's Day sale.](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-mothers-day-sale-best-deals) For more information on the Vitamix Ascent X5, read [my full review here](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-ascent-x5-blender-review), or check out the more affordable [Explorian model E310](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-explorian-e310-blender-review).\n## How to use the soup function on the Vitamix Ascent X5\nMaking soup directly in the Vitamix is dead simple. The only thing you have to be aware of is you can't make adjustments on the fly. You have to wait for the blender to complete its seven to eight minute soup cycle before you taste it and adjust for seasoning and consistency. \n### 1. Load up the blender\nLoad the blender container with your ingredients. I've made tomato soup, broccoli soup, and potato soup in the Vitamix, and I've tried recipes that use completely raw ingredients, all cooked ingredients, and ones with a mixture of pre-cooked and raw. Keep in mind that the blender will essentially poach your ingredients, so you can add flavor by pre-cooking some items. Roast tomatoes before adding them, char broccoli, or sear some onions before tossing them into the blender. In my tomato soup today, I roasted the tomatoes and included the charred skin, but I left the onion and garlic raw. On another day, I might do the opposite. \nBesides the main bulk of your soup, remember to add enough liquid. It seems logical but you'd be surprised how quickly fibrous vegetables can make the soup mixture too thick to blend well. Keep a measuring cup with broth nearby so you can drizzle some in through the opening on the lid if necessary. (More on adjusting consistency in a moment.)\n### 2. Navigate the presets\nFit the container onto the base, turn on the Vitamix, and press the menu button on the left. It looks like three horizontal lines. Once you're here, twist the round dial to find a picture that looks like a soup bowl emitting steam with a little spoon underneath. \nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nMake sure the lid is on tight, then press the start button on the right side. The Vitamix will start on a low speed and ramp up to speed 10 (the highest and loudest speed) within the first 30 seconds or so. Your work here is done.\nThe Vitamix will run through the soup setting in a little more than seven minutes. When I went to take the temperature of my tomato soup today, a thick plume of steam escaped when I pried off the lid. The soup read 179°F near the walls of the container and up to 186°F closer to the blades.\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\n## Adjusting the consistency\nAfter your soup is cooked, you may be interested in adjusting how thick or thin it is. It's way easier to thin out a soup rather than thicken it after it's finished. With that in mind, try to add a touch less liquid than the recipe instructs before you begin cooking, and then you can always stir water or broth into the mixture afterward. \nIf your soup is too thin, you could [blend in aquafaba](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-freeze-chickpea-liquid-aquafaba), a spoonful of canned cannellini beans, or even a couple spoonfuls of [leftover mashed potatoes](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-thicken-your-cozy-fall-soups-without-any-dairy-1849611042). Run the blender again on high speed but only until smooth; there's no need to do a full soup cycle again unless you're adding a raw ingredient.",

\"\\(opens in a new window\\)\") SEE 7 MORE \n## A mini thermal printer \nThermal printers have gotten smaller and smaller, and now they can fit in your pocket. Why a thermal printer? They can quickly produce stickers, notes, even temporary tattoos. I can think of 100 ways a teacher would use one of these printers. I like the [Notebuddy](https://zdcs.link/9wR73D?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Notebuddy&short_url=9wR73D&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") for its compact shape and easy-to-replace sticker paper. You connect via Bluetooth from your phone or laptop. \n## A scrolling ring\nIf you have a Kindle or TikTok habit, you know all too well the hand cramping that comes from having to hold and flip through with your thumb. There is a solution--the [scrolling ring](https://zdcs.link/QObKBY?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=scrolling%20ring&short_url=QObKBY&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"). Worn on your finger, you can press the forward, backward, or select button on your ring and control your phone or tablet remotely. You could even use it on whatever you are showing your class onscreen.  \n## A heated neck massager \nFor the last year, this [neck massager](https://zdcs.link/aMJ1DO?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=neck%20massager&short_url=aMJ1DO&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") has been all the rage on TikTok, but I didn't think much of it until I was gifted one. Holy moly. What makes it work differently is that it's shaped like a scarf you stretch around you, and put your arms through, so you can easily change the pressure based on how hard you stretch the massager. \n## Super Mario Bros. brick lamp \nI've been obsessed with this [Super Mario Bros. question mark light up brick](https://zdcs.link/z625pq?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20question%20mark%20light%20up%20brick&short_url=z625pq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"). It attaches to the wall or wherever else you'd like to stick it, and yes, you can actually punch it, and yes, it will make that deeply satisfying sound effect from the classic game. Imagine this in a classroom, where a swipe can serve as a reward. \n## Desk vacuum cleaner\nMy desk is where everything goes--mail, projects, books, gloves, my purse--so it often needs a cleaning. Can you even imagine what a teacher's desk looks like at the end of the day? I love this cordless [vacuum cleaner](https://zdcs.link/Q47B8G?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=vacuum%20cleaner&short_url=Q47B8G&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") that I can keep nearby and grab as needed to vacuum my keyboard and mousepad if I need to, without needing to clear away pens and cords. \n## A projecting microscope\nThe [Hue](https://zdcs.link/Qr2P5m?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hue&short_url=Qr2P5m&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is a fascinating piece of tech: a small camera on a bendy, telescoping arm can project anything to your screen via USB. The macro lens can project a doc, picture, live handwriting, or an ant walking across a table, all at 720px. \n## Endless flowers for their desk\nThe allure of LEGO is forever. This [flower bouquet set](https://zdcs.link/aRn5kX?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=flower%20bouquet%20set&short_url=aRn5kX&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is a project for relaxing at home, or working on with students. In either case, the resulting bouquet is more interesting than fresh flowers, and will give any teacher instant credibility with kids. \n## Sunrise alarm clock\nWaking up for another day of school with your little rays of light can be... a lot, but a [sunrise alarm](https://zdcs.link/aAgq65?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=sunrise%20alarm&short_url=aAgq65&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is the gentlest way someone can rise and shine. The alarm subtlety brings the level of light up in your room, timed to when you need to get up, mimicking the sunrise. \n## A wireless mic and speaker\nTeachers use their voice constantly during the day, trying to be heard over students. A little amplification couldn't hurt. A simple [wireless microphone ](https://zdcs.link/a03g8p?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=wireless%20microphone&short_url=a03g8p&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")means less shouting, and many less sore throats. \n## A notebook that's manual and digital\nFor some people, a tablet is too much tech, but a spiral notebook is too basic. Enter [Rocketbook](https://zdcs.link/aoG7kv?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Rocketbook&short_url=aoG7kv&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), which is the best of both. Write manually on the pages, and they'll be scanned to the Rocketbook app.",

    "title": "Beware of This Sophisticated Google Forms Scam",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Fraudsters are increasingly using recognizable and trusted domains to perpetuate phishing schemes that trick people into handing over their personal and financial information. In recent months, bad actors have exploited settings for both [Google and PayPal](https://lifehacker.com/tech/dont-fall-for-this-new-gmail-phishing-scheme) to lull targets into a false sense of security, making these attacks harder to spot. \nAnother way scammers are trying to look legitimate while evading detection is through Google Forms that request sensitive data. \n## How scammers use Google Forms to steal your personal data\nPhishing via Google Forms is not new. As [a recent report from ESET Security](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/scams/how-fraudsters-abuse-google-forms-spread-scams/ \"open in a new window\") points out, Google Forms are free, easy to create and implement, and trusted by users, making them a low-risk, high-reward vector for scammers. They're also encrypted with TLS and use dynamic URLs, making them less likely to be flagged as malicious.\nGoogle Forms scams may have several aims, ranging from stealing your login credentials or banking details to redirecting you to a fraudulent site that installs malware on your device. \nA recent (and relatively sophisticated) iteration of this scam targeted higher education, including students, faculty, and staff at 15 institutions in the U.S. A [post on Google's blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/phishing-targeting-higher-education \"open in a new window\") from February 2025 outlines a campaign in which attackers sent links to Google Forms that mimicked legitimate university communications, complete with the school names, color schemes, and logos or mascots displayed in the headers. The forms were designed to trick recipients into providing university account credentials and, in some cases, financial institution logins under the pretense of maintaining an existing account or distributing aid. \nScammers sent forms out around important dates on the academic calendar, such as financial aid deadlines, when recipients have lots of administrative tasks to complete and are less likely to notice potential red flags. \nWhile Google notes that all of the malicious forms identified were eventually removed, Stanford University's Information Security Office [issued an alert on April 23](https://uit.stanford.edu/news/phishing-alert-attackers-use-google-workspace-apps-steal-credentials \"open in a new window\") warning of a similar phishing scheme meant to steal passwords and Duo passcodes for university network accounts. \nThe attack begins with Stanford-branded Google Forms hosted on real google.com domains with valid SSL certificates. The forms appear to come from real Google email addresses and may include familiar names in the notifications (such as \"[Name] shared a document\"). Not only do these forms _look_ legitimate, but they are able to get past email malware detection. \n## How to avoid phishing attacks using Google Forms \nAlways have a critical eye when using Google Forms. Don't open forms sent unsolicited, and never, ever submit sensitive information--login credentials, bank account numbers, etc.--via Google Forms. (Google displays this warning on the form itself. Heed it.) No legitimate institution will request this type of data via Google Forms anyway, and if you're not sure, contact the organization directly to confirm the request. \nNot all Google Forms phishing campaigns will be as well-designed as those targeting higher ed, so you should also look for misspellings, punctuation errors, and odd salutations. One of the examples identified by ESET begins with \"Hello, Dear!\"\nIf you believe you have already submitted sensitive information via Google Forms, change your login credentials, freeze your credit cards, and stay on top of your accounts and credit report to identify any fraudulent activity. You should also be on the lookout for any signs of malware on your computer and remove it as quickly as possible (whether you're on [Mac](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-remove-malware-from-your-mac) or [PC](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-remove-malware-from-your-pc)).",

They have dual-driver bass technology that sends bass sound through the air, making these a hybrid BCH and open-ear with regular speakers. \nAs the name implies, the OpenRun Pro 2 are made with runners in mind. They're lightweight, coming in at 1.02 ounces, have an [_IP55_](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-waterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings \"open in a new window\") water resistance rating, and have a battery life of up to 12 hours with quick charging (a five-minute charge gives 2.5 hours of juice). The companion app comes with EQ settings and the headphones have Bluetooth 5.3. \nWhat makes these BCHs stand out for me are the lack of rattling vibration that tickles the ears when certain pitches are played. Keep in mind that if you choose to not use the dual-driver bass technology through the app and stick to 100% BCH, the ticklish vibration is present. But that hybrid technology is what makes the OpenRun Pro 2 the best-sounding BCHs in the market. And this is the best time to buy them.",

Plus, when it comes to personal shopping, tariffs will disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with apparel prices [predicted](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-trumps-latest-tariffs-could-affect-your-personal-spending \"open in a new window\") to rise 17%. And if you're accustomed to ultra-cheap online shopping, [dark days are ahead](https://lifehacker.com/money/what-todays-tariff-update-means-for-your-online-shopping-habit).\nGiven all these rising costs, it's more important than ever to keep on top of your spending habits. Making a [budget](https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you) is a great start, but following it easier said than done. It's one thing to abstractly vow to \"cut back on pricey coffee,\" but how do you stick to that when it's 7 a.m. and you need caffeine ASAP? Or what if your restrictive budget causes so much anxiety, you impulsively start \"[revenge spending](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-quit-revenge-spending-1850219784)?\" Let's take a look at some ways you can become a more conscientious spender, especially when prices are out of control.\n## Figure out where your money is going\nIn order to undo unconscious spending habits--like the costs of [lifestyle creep](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-lifestyle-creep)--you have to confront some tough questions about your finances as honestly as possible. \nThe most important question to answer: _Where does my money go?****_ Don't settle for estimates, here. Go through your bank statements and look your spending habits full in the face. Then evaluate which expenses are actually valuable to you, and not [some subscription service you forgot about long ago](https://lifehacker.com/its-time-to-audit-your-autopay-subscriptions-1845328634). It's far easier to eliminate unconscious spending once you bring it out into the open. \n## Recognize your spending triggers\nThe key to breaking any behavior is understanding what triggers it. Maybe you're prone to spending when you're stressed, bored, or celebrating. Or maybe it's simply about convenience, or social pressure, or compelling marketing tactics. \nTake time to reflect on your recent impulse purchases. What emotional state were you in? Were you influenced by others? Identifying these patterns is crucial to breaking the cycle.\n## Get specific about your money goals\nThe idea of \"cutting back on spending\" is abstract and hard to achieve. It's like saying you want to \"learn how to cook\" without ever picking out a recipe or buying any ingredients. Instead, you need specific, attainable goals to guide your conscientious spending. \nOne place to start with your specific spending goals is to **physically write down the things you want to buy _before_ you buy them**. Use those bank statements to inform what items make your official \"to-buy list.\" When you read over items on this list, you'll be able to make a more thoughtful decision as to what you really _need._\n## Create financial friction\nWhen I was a teenager who needed to stop biting her nails, I started wearing gloves. Did I look cool? Definitely not. But it worked. Make unconscious spending more difficult by creating barriers--or \"financial friction\"--for yourself by:\n  * Removing saved payment information from websites\n  * Unsubscribing from retail emails and notifications\n  * Deleting shopping apps from your phone\n  * Using cash for discretionary spending\n  * Placing savings in less accessible accounts\n\n\nThese obstacles seem small, but they can be a big help in curbing unconscious spending patterns.\n## Implement a waiting period\nAnother tactic is introducing a deliberate delay between the desire to purchase and the act of buying. Before making non-essential purchases, especially online, institute a mandatory waiting period:\n  * For items under $50: Wait 24 hours.\n  * For items $50-$100: Wait three days.\n  * For items over $100: Wait one week.\n\n\nThis simple delay helps distinguish between wants and needs, often breaking the spell of impulsive desires. Think of it as a cooling-off period.\n## Remember, you're still allowed to treat yourself\nCold-turkey restriction is a recipe for an unhealthy relationship with money. Instead, it's important to indulge _thoughtfully_. Ask yourself, \"How do I expect this purchase will make me feel? What do I want it to make me feel? What feelings am I trying to _avoid_ by buying it?\" When you feel confident that you're spending only on things you love and not wasting money on things you don't love, you will make much better financial decisions. \nOnly you can determine what is truly valuable in your life. Personally, I've budgeted enough money for my daily coffee indulgence. For you, it might mean treating yourself to a fancy dinner once a month, or cutting back on restaurant costs in order to go wild on vacation in a few months. Allow yourself to indulge, especially if these indulgences improve your o[verall relationship with your money](https://lifehacker.com/take-these-steps-to-heal-your-relationship-with-money-1850269034).",

    "content": "Instacart is rolling out a new app, but it's not for ordering groceries--at least, not the essentials. Instead, Instacart sees \"Fizz\" as a party delivery app, designed for ordering snacks and alcoholic drinks. \nFizz isn't the first to offer alcohol delivery, of course. Instacart itself supports alcohol delivery wherever it's legal, as does DoorDash. But perhaps the most notorious alcohol delivery app was Drizly: The service was a popular option for ordering alcohol, but its reputation suffered [following a massive 2020 data breach](https://lifehacker.com/protect-yourself-from-the-hack-of-alcohol-delivery-serv-1844545112). Uber acquired the app the following year, [then shut it down in 2024](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-drizly-closing-march-2024/ \"open in a new window\"). \nBut Fizz isn't a Drizly clone. Instead, the app seems more like if Drizly crossed with a party-planning app like Partiful or [Apple's Invites](https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-new-invites-app)--not only do you order drinks and snacks, but you invite others to do so as well. In fact, Fizz is now embedded in the Partiful app, so you can use it when planning a party at large.\nInstacart says after you start a \"party cart,\" you can share a link with friends to invite them to join. (They don't need the Fizz app to participate.) Everyone in the group can see what's already been ordered, and can add whatever they want. Anything you add to a party cart, you pay for yourself, which I feel mixed about. On the one hand, it's cool to let people \"bring\" what they want to the party, without needing to track people down to pay for their share. But for some parties and gatherings, it makes sense to split everything evenly. It'd be nice if Fizz would at least add that as an option. \nIf you want to use Fizz with Partiful, you can choose to enable \"Group Order\" in the app. Then, everyone on the Partiful can access the Fizz link.\nCredit: Instacart\nAs the app is made for ordering alcohol, it's only available to users 21 and older. There's also a flat $5 delivery fee for all orders, though that does not include a tip.\nIf you live in a state or area where alcohol delivery isn't legal, you can't use Fizz (or any alcohol delivery service).

But that's where the differences end, at least according to [PCMag's 3.5-star review](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-scribe-2024 \"open in a new window\").\nOtherwise, you'll get the same book format compatibility, the same 15.3 oz weight, the same glare-free 300 ppi front-lit display screen, and the same 12-week battery life.

Still, if you don't own a Scribe at all and are considering getting one, the newer version is the better option, especially since it is currently cheaper than the older version.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nWhen I wrote about [_adding baking soda to ground beef_](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/add-baking-soda-to-ground-beef) for better browning and moisture retention, the readership was starkly divided--those who think [_this chemical reaction_](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/6909-uses-for-baking-soda \"open in a new window\") is pure snake oil, and those who want to know immediately how to apply this technique to hamburgers. Well, for those of you mapping out your Memorial Day weekend grill game, saddle up. This very real chemical reaction is indeed perfectly suited to improving your summer burgers.\n## How does baking soda make meat tender? \nBaking soda reacts with the proteins in meats, whether ground or not, preventing them from winding up as tightly as they normally would when cooking. This is a technique that's been around for ages in Chinese cooking, [_called velveting_](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-tenderise-beef-velveting-beef/ \"open in a new window\"). You've probably seen steak, chicken, bacon, and hamburgers that haven't been treated with baking soda shrink dramatically after cooking. The protein network starts to squeeze and clench up as it heats, expelling the meat's natural juices. When you bite into it, the meat feels rubbery and dry because the proteins are wound tight and the juices have been left behind in the pan or down in the charcoal pit. \nBaking soda-treated meats have looser protein networks that maintain a comparatively greater amount of natural juices. To the palate, this feels like a tender, juicy, more flavorful hamburger patty with a crispy brown exterior. Oh about that: The browning gets better too.\n## How does baking soda improve browning?\nIt turns out that the [_Maillard reaction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction \"open in a new window\") (the attractive and flavorful browning that happens to foods when they cook at around 300°F) happens faster in a more alkaline environment. A sprinkle of baking soda is enough to increase the PH and cause more pronounced browning to occur faster, whether it's in banana waffles or with meat. This literally creates new flavors in your food, thus your burger will actually be more flavorful by incorporating a pinch of this basic pantry item. \nTo demonstrate, I split up a pound of 93% lean ground beef and added a half teaspoon of baking soda to one half of the meat. I shaped the meat into patties and griddled up both types of burgers in a light spritz of canola oil to ensure good contact with the heat. I cooked each burger to reach 140°F to 145°F degrees for medium doneness. You can see in the picture, it's pretty easy to tell which one was treated with baking soda. \nThe baking soda treated burger on the right has better browning and less shrinkage occurred.  Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\n## How to make better burgers with baking soda\nThis small amount of baking soda leaves no off flavors behind in your burger, and it reduces moisture loss, which keeps the shrinking to a minimum (you won't end up with tiny burgers on huge buns). The result is tender meat, and you'll be rewarded with a lovely brown crust. Here's how I do it.\n### 1. Season the ground meat\nI add the ground burger meat to a large bowl and season it with salt. Go ahead and add any other seasonings you like. Then dust baking soda over the surface of the meat. For every eight ounces (half-pound) of ground meat, I used a half-teaspoon of baking soda. \nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\n### 2. Mix it thoroughly\nThen you need to get your hands dirty. I'm sure you could do this with a spoon but I find it much quicker to do it with my hands. I find that the seasoning gets more thoroughly distributed this way too. If you want to keep your hands clean, don some vinyl food-safe gloves. Squeeze and toss the meat in the bowl until it's well mixed.\n### 3. Shape the patties and cook\nForm the patties with your hands and have them ready on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, or a plate for a small batch. Let them rest in the fridge while you get the pan or the grill ready. Cook as usual. \nI recommend testing for doneness with a meat thermometer rather than by color. With the accelerated browning of the exterior, you don't want to remove the burger too soon. I use the [_Thermapen One_](https://zdcs.link/Qqw2M6?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Thermapen%20One&short_url=Qqw2M6&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") and I love it. Try to insert the probe end at a side angle toward the center as much as possible. You want a reading for the center, not to poke through to the other side. Once done, let your burgers rest for a few minutes off the heat--which I think happens naturally as you plate them and dress them with fixin's--and enjoy the first bite of summer grill season.",

And the hallucination problem isn't getting better as AI models progress--in fact, it's getting worse.\nIn a new [technical report](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf \"open in a new window\") from OpenAI (via [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html \"open in a new window\")), the company details how its latest o3 and o4-mini models hallucinate 51 percent and 79 percent, respectively, on an AI benchmark known as SimpleQA. For the earlier o1 model, the SimpleQA hallucination rate stands at 44 percent.\nThose are surprisingly high figures, and heading in the wrong direction. These models are [known as reasoning models](https://lifehacker.com/tech/openai-promises-chatgpt-o3-model-better-at-reasoning) because they think through their answers and deliver them more slowly. Clearly, based on OpenAI's own testing, this mulling over of responses is leaving more room for mistakes and inaccuracies to be introduced.\nFalse facts are by no means limited to OpenAI and ChatGPT. For example, it didn't take me long when testing Google's AI Overview search feature to [get it to make a mistake](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-ai-nonsense-sayings-illustrates-problems), and AI's inability to properly pull out information from the web [has been well-documented](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-people-are-getting-wrong-this-week-google-ai-hallucinations). Recently, a support bot for AI coding app Cursor announced a policy change that [hadn't actually been made](https://old.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1jyy5am/psa_cursor_now_restricts_logins_to_a_single/ \"open in a new window\").\nBut you won't find many mentions of these hallucinations in the announcements AI companies make about their latest and greatest products. Together with energy use and [copyright infringement](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/openais-models-memorized-copyrighted-content-new-study-suggests/ \"open in a new window\"), hallucinations are something that the big names in AI would rather not talk about.\nAnecdotally, I haven't noticed too many inaccuracies when using AI search and bots--the error rate is certainly nowhere near 79 percent, though mistakes are made. However, it looks like this is a problem that might never go away, particularly as the teams working on these AI models don't fully understand why hallucinations happen.\nIn tests run by AI platform developer Vectera, the results [are much better](https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard \"open in a new window\"), though not perfect: Here, many models are showing hallucination rates of one to three percent. OpenAI's o3 model stands at 6.8 percent, with the newer (and smaller) o4-mini at 4.6 percent. That's more in line with my experience interacting with these tools, but even a very low number of hallucinations can mean a big problem--especially as we transfer more and more tasks and responsibilities to these AI systems.\n## Finding the causes of hallucinations\nChatGPT knows not to put glue on pizza, at least. Credit: Lifehacker\nNo one really knows how to fix hallucinations, or fully identify their causes: These models aren't built to follow rules set by their programmers, but to choose their own way of working and responding. Vectara chief executive Amr Awadallah told [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html \"open in a new window\") that AI models will \"always hallucinate,\" and that these problems will \"never go away.\"\nUniversity of Washington professor Hannaneh Hajishirzi, who is working on ways to reverse engineer answers from AI, told the NYT that \"we still don't know how these models work exactly.\" Just like troubleshooting a problem with your car or your PC, you need to know what's gone wrong to do something about it.\nAccording to researcher Neil Chowdhury, from AI analysis lab Transluce, the way reasoning models are built may be making the problem worse. \"Our hypothesis is that the kind of reinforcement learning used for o-series models may amplify issues that are usually mitigated (but not fully erased) by standard post-training pipelines,\" he told [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/ \"open in a new window\").\nIn OpenAI's own performance report, meanwhile, the issue of \"less world knowledge\" is mentioned, while it's also noted that the o3 model tends to make more claims than its predecessor--which then leads to more hallucinations. Ultimately, though, \"more research is needed to understand the cause of these results,\" according to OpenAI.\nAnd there are plenty of people undertaking that research. For example, Oxford University academics have [published a method](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-06-20-major-research-hallucinating-generative-models-advances-reliability-artificial \"open in a new window\") for detecting the probability of hallucinations by measuring the variation between multiple AI outputs. However, this costs more in terms of time and processing power, and doesn't really solve the issue of hallucinations--it just tells you when they're more likely.\nWhile letting AI models check their facts on the web can help in certain situations, they're not particularly good at this either. They lack (and will never have) simple human common sense that says [glue shouldn't be put on a pizza](https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-ai-still-recommending-glue-pizza) or that [$410 for a Starbucks coffee](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-people-are-getting-wrong-this-week-google-ai-hallucinations) is clearly a mistake.\nWhat's definite is that AI bots can't be trusted all of the time, despite their confident tone--whether they're giving you [news summaries](https://lifehacker.com/tech/bbc-study-shows-how-inaccurate-ai-news-summaries-are), [legal advice](https://lifehacker.com/tech/nyc-ai-chatbot-hallucinating), or [interview transcripts](https://lifehacker.com/tech/openais-transcriptions-make-up-things-you-never-said-to-doctor). That's important to remember as these AI models show up more and more in our personal and work lives, and it's a good idea to limit AI to use cases where hallucinations matter less.\n_Disclosure: Lifehacker 's parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems._",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Do You Really Have ADHD?",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Maybe it's not fair to call a medical diagnosis \"trendy,\" but more and more adults in the U.S. are seeking treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD, once regarded as a childhood disease, has made the transition to adulthood: About [ 15.5 million adults in the U.S. have been \"officially\" diagnosed with the disorder](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7340a1.htm \"open in a new window\"), and a growing group of others believe they have ADHD. A _lot_ of them are wrong, but that's OK.\nFed by a steady stream of online influencers and pop science, more and more people are self-diagnosing with ADHD, autism, depression, and other mental disorders. Very few of them are qualified to make these diagnoses. While it's easy to scoff at someone self-diagnosing a complex mental illness after watching a TikTok, the rise in self-diagnosis, however flawed, points to an unmet need for mental health care. \n## The double-edged sword of \"awareness\"\nA recent survey found that more than half of the members of [Generation Z get health information from TikTok](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/health-advice-gen-z-tiktok/ \"open in a new window\"), and there are over four million videos tagged [#ADHD](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/adhd \"open in a new window\") on the platform. It's in the top 10 of health-related hashtags, and the top 100 videos on the subject have a collected view total of nearly half a billion. So ADHD awareness is _high_ , particularly among young people, and that's a good thing. \nThe disease is [under-diagnosed and under-treated](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4195639/ \"open in a new window\") in adults in the U.S. ADHD has been linked to job loss, depression, substance abuse, and higher morbidity rates. Talking about the disorder online de-stigmatizes it, and may lead many to seek treatment they might not have previously. And treatment is [effective.](https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/emotional-wellbeing/adhd-toolkit/treatment-and-management.html \"open in a new window\") So it's great that more people are wondering if they have ADHD--but that awareness has a downside. \nA [recent study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335 \"open in a new window\") of 100 of the most popular #ADHD videos (with a combined view-count of around half a billion) indicates that more than 50% of the claims made about the disorder in these videos are misleading. With each false claim in a TikTok video, the popular perception of what ADHD actually is strays further from a mental illness toward a trendy collection of quirks. \n## Why you're (probably) wrong about your self-diagnosed ADHD\nYou can't tell if you have ADHD from an online quiz or from relating to someone else's video. Self-diagnosis lacks the objectivity and clinical context of a professional diagnosis, and even doctors can find it difficult to recognize ADHD. Among people who seek treatment, ADHD is usually accompanied by other psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or alcohol abuse. Medical professionals, with training and experience, often treat those co-morbidities [instead of the underlying problem](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4195639/ \"open in a new window\"), so it's no surprise that average people scrolling TikTok so often get it wrong. But those mistakes still serve an important purpose.\n## Maybe it's not ADHD, but maybe that's not the point\nADHD is not sometimes forgetting appointments or zoning out in meetings occasionally. Popular ADHD videos on social media often equate common life experiences--losing your keys, hyperfixation on hobbies, blurting out thoughts--as symptoms. Those _could_ be indicative of the disorder, or they could be just part of being human. It's a spectrum, and, as with autism, this can lead to overgeneralization and[ people believing normal human experiences are part of a mental illness](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13591045221098522 \"open in a new window\"); conversely, it can lead to neurotypical people viewing a serious mental health issue as something quirky, cute, or funny. This is not good, but it beats the alternative of having no explanation or language to talk about a mental illness.\nWhen people say, \"I think I have ADHD,\" they often mean something like: \"I'm struggling, and maybe this is why.\" Whether the impulsivity and inability to focus they are experiencing fit the diagnostic criteria of ADHD or not, paying attention, noticing patterns, and taking mental health seriously are important. Maybe that's not a medical diagnosis, but it can be an important act of self-reflection. For many, putting a name to the struggle is a first step toward seeking support, even if the label isn't exactly accurate.\n## Why people are drawn to misleading ADHD videos\nIt's easy to blame social media for spreading misinformation about healthcare--it does, constantly--but people choose to get medical information from social media for understandable reasons. Many regard the way medicine is practiced as impersonal, even scary, and view doctors as [untrustworthy](https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/08/07/trust-in-physicians-hospitals-research/ \"open in a new window\"). Social media figures, on the other hand, are charismatic, non-threatening, non-judgmental, and don't charge for their time. \nIn a perfect world, ADHD TikTok would be a gateway to medical evaluation and treatment, but too often, it becomes the end of the line. Non-evidence-based \"treatments\" gain traction. Skepticism of doctors hardens into full-blown mistrust. And [as research shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X19303032?via%3Dihub \"open in a new window\"), frequent social media use often correlates with worse patient-provider relationships--though it's unclear which is the cause and which the effect.\n## Social media will (probably) continue to serve as a support system\nTikTok, Instagram, and Facebook aren't optimal ways to approach diagnosis or treatment, but given the current realities of the healthcare system, it may be the best many people can do. Until structural changes make mental health care more affordable and accessible, platforms like TikTok will continue to serve as makeshift support systems. Flawed as they are, they're filling a gap the medical system has yet to close. And for now, that may be the only starting point available to millions.",

    "title": "BuzzKill Is the Best Way to Manage Your Android Notifications",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Phone notifications are tricky to balance: too many of them, and you're constantly distracted by buzzes and pings. Too few of them, and you risk missing something important, from a relative in trouble to [a great deal on headphones](https://lifehacker.com/tech/beats-studio-pro-deal) (two ends of the importance scale there, but you get the idea).\nOver the years, Apple and Google have tweaked and refined the notification systems built into iOS and Android, but there's still room for improvement. The native features that are currently in place [work fine](https://lifehacker.com/set-up-your-phone-to-keep-you-focused-during-workouts-1850283863), but lack the sort of granular control you need to properly manage the alerts you want and the alerts you don't want.\nEnter [BuzzKill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.buzzkill \"open in a new window\"): It's Android only (sorry, iPhone users), and it'll cost you $4, but it does a fine job of managing notifications for you. It hits the sweet spot to give you a powerful set of options to manage without feeling overwhelming or cluttered, and it just might be the notification solution you've been looking for.\nUnfortunately there's no free trial to take advantage of, though the developer does promise to refund you your money if you're not happy with the app--and as I take you through some of the features it offers here, you should get a good idea of whether or not this is an app you're going to find useful on your own phone.\n## Creating rules in BuzzKill\nRules have certain criteria attached to them. Credit: Lifehacker\nLoad up BuzzKill for the first time, and once you've given it the necessary permissions to run in the background and access your notifications, you're ready to add your first rule: Tap on **Create rule** to do this. That then leads you to a rule builder that will look familiar if you've ever attempted to set up [filters for your email](https://lifehacker.com/the-easiest-way-to-filter-junk-out-of-your-gmail-inbox-1850903652).\nThere are two parts to each rule: how to identify the notifications that qualify it (tap **any app** and **contains anything** to specify the criteria), and then the action to take for matching alerts (tap **do nothing** to set an action). To begin with, you'll need to pick a specific app-- whether it's Uber, WhatsApp, or anything else you've got installed--and you can select multiple apps per rule.\nYou can leave a rule to apply to all notifications from your chosen app(s), or you can specify further filters. BuzzKill is able to look for words or phrases inside notifications, plus certain notification attributes for the notification--such as whether or not it has an image in it, or whether it's from a group conversation (handy for those group chats).\nYou can build up some quite complex filters this way, and it's even possible to nest certain criteria in sub-groups. You can ask BuzzKill to match all the filter rules you've listed, or just some of them (so a rule might be applied to messages from group chats or with images in them, or only when both of those criteria are met, for example).\nAll you then need to do is specify the action that BuzzKill needs to take, and it's here that the app really proves its value. You can do everything from mute an alert, to make sure it's unmuted even if your phone is silenced--so BuzzKill is useful for getting your attention for important notifications as well as reducing distractions from more minor ones. You can also invoke popular automation tool [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm \"open in a new window\") from BuzzKill for even more control.\n## Managing rules in BuzzKill\nHead to the Explore tab for inspiration for your rules. Credit: Lifehacker\nOnce you've started creating rules in the app, they can be managed from the **Rules** tab: Simple toggle switches let you enable or disable them, and you can also delete and duplicate rules by tapping the three dots in the top left corner of the rule box.\nOver on the **History** tab, you can see stats relating to all the notifications that have come in on your phone, with filters and summaries available if you need them. One handy feature on this screen is the option to create a new rule based on a notification you've already received: Just tap on the notification and pick **Create rule**.\nThe **Explore** tab gives you some examples of what BuzzKill can do, and it's a great resource for finding inspiration. For example, you can set up automatic replies to incoming messages, or snooze alerts that arrive together in quick succession, or create a custom vibration for communications from a particular contact.\nHead to the **Settings** tab and you can play around with some of the app options. From here you're able to give BuzzKill control over persistent notifications that stick around in the status bar, and create shortcuts for quickly triggering rules from the home screen or the quick settings panel on Android.\nI've found BuzzKill most useful for shushing apps that I don't particularly want to hear from during the day, without losing those notifications altogether--above and beyond the features that you get with Android itself. Creating and managing rules is also straightforward, and there's an export tool for moving them to another device (BuzzKill is particularly privacy-conscious, and doesn't connect to the web).",

Fast-paced games show noticeable blur and smearing, especially with dark transitions, and the input lag at 165Hz and 60Hz can reportedly feel sluggish (oddly enough, gameplay feels snappier at 120Hz). Additionally, the backlight strobing feature, meant to reduce motion blur, introduces ghosting and can't be used with VRR on. HDR is supported, but you'll want to keep expectations in check--it gets bright enough to fight off some glare, but not enough to deliver meaningful [HDR performance](https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-hdr-high-dynamic-range \"open in a new window\").\nIt works decently with consoles like the [PS5](https://zdcs.link/a03gLN?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PS5&short_url=a03gLN&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") and [Xbox Series X|S](https://zdcs.link/aoG7YL?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS&short_url=aoG7YL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), but you'll have to tweak settings to avoid compatibility hiccups with 4K and HDR signals. You also won't find any USB-C ports or a USB hub here, and there are no built-in speakers either. Plus, its narrow viewing angles mean once you move off to the side or stand up, the picture quality takes a hit--so it's not ideal for couch co-op or multitasking with someone else. But for solo gaming on a budget, especially if you're playing slower-paced or story-driven games, it delivers a big screen with immersive visuals and decent contrast. If you're considering alternatives, the [Dell G2724D Gaming Monitor](https://zdcs.link/QWY1vl?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dell%20G2724D%20Gaming%20Monitor&short_url=QWY1vl&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") makes a good case for itself with similar specs, but it comes at a higher price point of $314.",

If you use the Stelo monitor, you can view some glucose statistics in the Oura app, including how your blood glucose responds to the meals you track. \n## How Oura's meal tracking works\nOnce you have the Meals feature enabled (it's rolling out to everyone today, the company says), just tap the plus sign in the lower right corner and select \"Log a meal.\" \nThe simplest way to log a meal is to take a photo of your food, but don't worry if you forget until your plate is clean. You can tap \"Text input\" at the bottom to type in a description of what you ate, or select one of your recent meals if you're repeating something you ate within the past few days. \nThe app takes a few seconds to think, and then it tells you what it believes you ate. (You can correct it if it's wrong--more about that below.) Then it gives you some text feedback about your meal and a little section of statistics judging whether the meal was high or low in protein, fiber, and other factors--mostly macronutrients, but also how \"processed\" the meal was. \nThe feedback encourages you to eat more protein and vegetables, without getting negative about your choices, and I appreciate that. Oura says in its press release: \"Oura's guidance avoids penalizing food choices, instead presenting non-judgmental insights that help members make informed choices based on their health objectives, whether that's improving energy levels, maintaining metabolic health, or enhancing dietary balance.\"\n## The advice is gentle and the results are usually correct\nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nOura's conclusions about what's in a food photo have usually been correct for me, but sometimes it misses an ingredient--for example, it might log a \"rice and beans bowl\" but not notice that there was also chicken in the mix. The description might suggest that I could include protein next time. As I said earlier, this is no big deal, because you can correct this at the bottom of the screen. \nScroll down and you'll see a list of the ingredients or components of your meal. You can remove components that weren't actually there and add anything that the AI missed. I found this process quick and easy. In a few taps, the app would then tell me that I did a great job getting both protein and fiber in my meal, and the stats would look correct. \nThe text feedback on the meals is sometimes helpful, but at other times is too vague and generic to be of any real use. The few shreds of cabbage in my rice bowl contain anthocyanins? I don't actually care. Garlic was valued in ancient civilizations for its medicinal properties? Great, that's super important to know when I'm logging some garlic bread as a snack.\nI do sometimes enjoy that it suggests a way I could improve the meal next time--usually by adding some veggies or protein--but when I _do_ log a meal with veggies and protein, it then just suggests that I might want to have the meal with \"extra veggies\" next time. \n## I loved seeing a graphic of my meal timing\nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nI've been disorganized with my eating lately, sometimes snarfing down snacks throughout the day and not sitting down to a real dinner until late in the evening. I know that late meals can affect my sleep, and that mealtimes are important for setting your body's clock. So I was delighted to see that Oura tracks the _time_ of meals as well as their content. \nEach meal I log is shown on a circle that represents my day. My sleep times and wind-down (bedtime) hours are shown in blue and green, respectively. There's a yellow dot for each meal I logged today, and a yellowish area showing the times I normally eat. Right now, the app judges my mealtimes as \"irregular.\" Harsh, but true. I can see on the circular graphic just how late I've been eating. \n## Where Oura's Meals feature falls short\nThe functions of the Meals feature seem to work quite well, but so many functions are missing. For example, I can only see that nice graph of meal timing after I log a meal! There's no way to access it just to take a peek. I tried asking the AI Advisor about my meal patterns, and it describes them to me in text, but says it can't generate graphs or images to share with me. \nI also wish I could see a summary of how I'm doing on protein, fiber, level of processing, and the other factors Oura tracks. But again, these only show up when you log a meal, and aren't available otherwise. The Advisor will describe them to me in broad terms (\"Your meals show balance, but your fiber and added sugar trends stand out\") but I hoped for better. \nAnother feature it's missing--which I'm actually OK with--is that it doesn't seem to care _how much_ food you're eating. It doesn't know how many grams of protein I've eaten, and certainly has no clue about the number of calories. On the one hand: excellent. I don't need another app assuming that I want to lose weight or making me measure everything as I log it. \"Yes, that's rice\" is so much easier to tell the app than \"I ate exactly 205 grams of rice.\" \nBut on the other hand, the recommendations would make more sense if the app had a sense of balance. Did I eat a lot of chicken breast and a small amount of candy today, or the other way around? Those would be drastically different eating patterns, worth giving drastically different advice.",

    "content": "If you receive an email about your Social Security statement, proceed with caution: According to [a new report from Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/04/fake-social-security-statement-emails-trick-users-into-installing-remote-tool \"open in a new window\"), hackers are impersonating the Social Security Administration (SSA) to trick people into installing a remote access tool and handing over full control of their devices. \nThe SSA is no stranger to phishing scams--the Office of the Inspector General [put out an alert last month](https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/april-2025-scam-alert-fake-emails.pdf \"open in a new window\") warning the public of fraudulent emails purporting to include Social Security statements that in reality led to fake websites. \n## How the Social Security phishing scam works\nThe current attack is the work of a phishing group known as Molatori. It begins with an email that appears to come from the SSA with the message, \"Your Social Security Statement is now available\" and a prompt to download an attached document. The supposed statement is actually a ScreenConnect client, which grants remote control of the affected device. \nScreenConnect is a legitimate remote support platform for IT pros to help users configure systems and resolve technical issues by allowing the same access as if they had your device in hand. Once hackers have control of your computer via ScreenConnect, they can use it for anything from installing malware to transferring files to accessing sensitive data, like bank and financial account information, all without your knowledge. \nFinancial fraud is believed to be the main objective for this campaign, but as always, stolen data can be used for identity theft or sold to other malicious groups. \nAs Malwarebytes Labs describes, this scheme is hard to identify in part because the phishing emails originate from compromised WordPress sites with legitimate domains. The email body may also be sent as an image rather than text, making it harder for filters to detect it as malicious. \n## How to protect yourself\nAll of the common cautions for avoiding phishing scams apply here. Do not click on links or download or open files or attachments sent via email, especially if the message is unsolicited. Go directly to the company's or organization's website to locate important documents and verify communication. Attacks that come from compromised (but legitimate) domains can be trickier to catch, so be especially wary of anything you're instructed to download, click, or fill out from an email. \nIf you are unsure whether an email or message is real and safe, Malwarebytes also suggests copying some of the text into a search engine to determine if it is part of a known phishing campaign.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "If you're sensing the world right now is becoming more and more unhinged, you're not alone. Fortunately there's a podcast poking holes in your subject of choice, whether that be diet culture, science journals, airport books, or Bill Maher specifically. With research and often a sense of humor, these shows break down some of the messages we are getting online, in the news, and across all sorts of media, explaining why you're not crazy, it isn't you, and why some of the systems we have right now (looking at you, capitalism) are broken. \n* * *\n## _Normal Curves_\nCredit: Normal Curves\n[__Normal Curves__](https://episodes.fm/1796408698 \"open in a new window\") is kind of like a science book club--on every episode, stat-savvy friends (and professors) Regina Nuzzo and Kristin Sainani help make sense of academic journals that have made their way to mainstream and pop culture. Examples include The Sweaty T-Shirt Study, which said you could find a perfect mate by smelling their sweat, and the The Red Dress Effect, which said that women in red were sexier. They're the ones you can count on to dissect the data, challenge the claims, and arm you with tools to assess scientific studies on your own. \n* * *\n## _Diabolical Lies_\nCredit: Diabolical Lies\nIs tradwife TikTok confusing the heck out of you? Wondering why capitalism feels like a scam wrapped in a vibe? Allow me to introduce you to [__Diabolical Lies__](https://episodes.fm/1761438573 \"open in a new window\"), your new favorite rabbit hole. Hosted by Katie Gatti Tassin and Caro Claire Burke, this long-form (episodes are upwards of three hours long) podcast is part cultural critique, part political roast, and fully addictive. Katie and Caro named their show _Diabolical Lies_ to poke fun at something Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker in a speech, that \"it's the women who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\" suggesting that feminism is the source of our unhappiness. Katie and Caro point their fingers at capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy, instead. They hold everything, from the yassification of Christian nationalism to the myth of the girl boss, all to the fire while making you laugh, think, and maybe (probably) get a little mad. \n* * *\n## _Corporate Gossip_\nCredit: Corporate Gossip\nIf you think the best true-crime is white collar crime, you might want to tune into [__Corporate Gossip__](https://episodes.fm/1650850378 \"open in a new window\"), which is all about the shady stuff that happens in board rooms and business deals. Hosts (and siblings) Becca and Adam Platsky use tons of research and storytelling to tell the truth behind eBay, the WWE and Vince McMahon, Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX, Enron, and more. The topics are serious, but the vibe is casual and often hilarious. \n* * *\n## _Oddly Specific_\nCredit: Oddly Specific\nMeredith Lynch (who you may recognize from TikTok) has one foot in pop culture and the other in politics--and her show represents that. [__Oddly Specific__](https://episodes.fm/1742492575 \"open in a new window\") features a bit of everything, from the problem with dollar stores to the prison industrial complex. Experts come on to cover things they're passionate about, and Meredith has a good way of explaining the basics of the subject at hand, exposing its problems, and helping you understand why it matters to you, your wallet, and your everyday life.\n* * *\n## _Bad Therapist_\nCredit: Bad Therapist\nIf you've ever side-eyed an Instagram carousel telling you to \"cut off anyone who drains your energy,\" there's a chance you've been served some therapy speak. Fortunately, the podcast [__Bad Therapist__](https://episodes.fm/1780035004 \"open in a new window\") is here to help. Psychotherapist Ash Compton and journalist Rachel Monroe are pro-therapy, but they are also pro-skewering the bad actors who use pop psych cliches and weaponize wellness to make a living from it, usually taking advantage of people who actually need real help. Whether they're dissecting therapeutic communes, conversion therapy, or life coaches, all roads lead to grifting. Along the way, you're always in for some history, cultural analysis, and humor. \n* * *\n## _If Books Could Kill_\nCredit: If Books Could Kill\nYou know those best-selling books--the ones that often promote miracle diets, pop psychology, pseudo-science, and reskinned versions of _The Secret --_sold at the airport that seem to take the country by storm, one book at a time? Michael Hobbes (original co-host of _You 're Wrong About_ and co-host of _Maintenance Phase_) and Peter Shamshiri host [__If Books Could Kill__](https://episodes.fm/1651876897 \"open in a new window\"), a podcast about those books and how they shape our culture and ruin our minds. (There is actually an entire episode dedicated to _The Secret._) Together they point out the lack of citations, vague references, and fear-based marketing you find in every page. Episodes swing from hefty (the episode on _Liberal Facism_) to lighter and silly (there's a great one on _Who Moved My Cheese?_).\n* * *\n## _The Dream_\nCredit: The Dream\nSeasons one and two of _[_The Dream_](https://episodes.fm/1435743296 \"open in a new window\")_ are about multilevel marketing schemes and fraud in the wellness industry, but the show has since been turned into a weekly interview show. Its episodes now focus on a myriad of subjects, but they're all generally about critiquing the people, industries, and concepts that make \"the American Dream\" unmanageable. Hosted by _This American Life_ alum Jane Marie, episodes cover the MAHA movement, abortion bans, cults, divorce, and more. Jane Marie is a top-notch storyteller and interviewer--even episodes that feel heavy have a lightness to them. \n* * *\n## _5-4_\nCredit: 5-4\nHosted by Peter Routhier ([__If Books Could Kill__](https://episodes.fm/1651876897 \"open in a new window\")), Rhiannon Brown, and Michael F. Vecchione,__[_5-4_](https://episodes.fm/1497785843 \"open in a new window\") __ provides a funny, liberal perspective on the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, often illustrating how much SCOTUS totally sucks. Always from a progressive point of view, each episode analyzes and discusses a single Supreme Court decision, providing an accessible and engaging way for listeners to learn about the high court's biases surrounding hot-button issues like affirmative action, gun rights, and campaign finance. It clears the fog from our court system and clarifies how often the Supreme Court perpetuates unjust outcomes for marginalized groups. \n* * *\n## _Knowledge Fight_\nCredit: Knowledge Fight\nDan Friesen and Jordan Holmes keep close tabs on Alex Jones so you don't have to. Each week on [__Knowledge Fight__](https://episodes.fm/1192992870 \"open in a new window\") they review recent clips from Jones' Infowars programming and try to make sense of it all. They go deep (and some of the content is dark) but Dan and Jordan are funny enough to make it both a wild ride and an enjoyable listen. There's no better way to learn about conspiracy theories than to study the people steeped in them, and this show is like Cliff's Notes for the source of many of the wildest theories taking hold of America.\n* * *\n## _Maintenance Phase_\nCredit: Maintenance Phase\nWhen Michael Hobbes left [__You 're Wrong About__](https://episodes.fm/1380008439 \"open in a new window\"), he put his energy into [__Maintenance Phase__](https://episodes.fm/1535408667 \"open in a new window\"), a show he co-hosts with Aubrey Gordon that explores and critiques popular health and wellness trends and products. With tons of notes and a lot of rage-laughter, Michael and Aubrey run through the the worst diets, exercise trends, supplements and beauty products, and \"nutrition\" books, and evaluate whether they are actually effective or if they are based on misleading or harmful information. (It's almost always the latter.) If you hate the BMI, were led astray by the food pyramid in the '90s, or roll your eyes every time your friend goes on and on about their latest cleanse, you'll appreciate their myth-busting efforts.\n* * *\n## _I Hate Bill Maher_\nCredit: I Hate Bill Maher\nComedian Will Weldon hates Bill Maher so much that he created an entire podcast about it. Every episode of his show, [__I Hate Bill Maher__](https://episodes.fm/1746469734 \"open in a new window\"), is a takedown of Bill Maher in general, but specifically his TV show _Real Time_ and his podcast _Club Random_ , episode by episode. Will is dead set on pointing out some of the superficial, misogynistic, and transphobic things Bill has said, as well as how lazy some of his comedy can be. He'll even dip back into old episodes of _Real Time_ to prove how much Bill's opinions have changed over the years. (Not much.) Some call it petty, some call it a public service. Listen to the Emma Arnold episode--Will interviews her about the time she got to tag along on Bill's annual New Year trip to Hawaii.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Microsoft is taking another big step toward eliminating passwords with a \"passwordless by default\" setting for new accounts. New users will be prompted to set up passkeys when creating their Microsoft logins, leaving passwords behind. \nThe company has had passwordless sign-in options for Windows 11 and Microsoft accounts for several years, and in 2024 [expanded passkey support](https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-accounts-passkeys-windows-11-android-apple) across Windows, Android, and iOS. This is a big change, but not one without reason. In fact, it may make Microsoft accounts more secure, and render many scammers' phishing tactics obsolete. \n## The benefits of passkeys\nPasskeys are not only easier to use than passwords combined with other forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) like SMS codes and authenticator apps--[they're also more secure](https://lifehacker.com/embrace-the-passwordless-future-of-passkeys-1850418024). Passkeys are cryptographically generated, stored on your device, and encrypted by default, making them immune to phishing and other cyberattacks. Without access to your device, bad actors can't hack your accounts. \nInstead of creating a complex password, which you then have to securely store (or remember), a device-based passkey allows you to quickly log into your accounts using biometrics like your face or fingerprint, or credentials like your PIN or password. \n## Passkeys are the default on new Microsoft accounts\nGoing forward, new Microsoft accounts will be \"passwordless by default.\" When you sign up for the first time, you'll be asked to enter your email address and verify it with a one-time code--without any need to create and save a password. Once you enter the one-time code, you'll be prompted to add a passkey using your face, fingerprint, or PIN. The next time you log in, you'll do so with with your chosen passkey. \nYou can choose to skip passkey setup and return to it later (tap **Skip for now** on the pop-up). Microsoft will set the \"best available\" passwordless sign-in method for your account as the default, which could be a one-time code or an enabled passkey. \nExisting Microsoft users [can manage passkeys](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/manage-your-passkeys-in-windows-6a70599a-25e1-4461-86be-d67d1023c69f \"open in a new window\") and delete passwords in the Settings app under **Accounts > Passkeys**. According to [Microsoft's announcement detailing the change](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/ \"open in a new window\"), the company aims to eventually remove password support completely.",

    "title": "When to Use Each ChatGPT Model, According to OpenAI",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "ChatGPT isn't based on just one AI model. On the contrary, there are a number of different models you can choose to power the chatbot with--[even more if you pay for it](https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-plus-free-trial-college-students). While you can experiment with each on your own, OpenAI has its take on when you should be using each--the advice is just a bit hidden. \n[As spotted by Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-document-explains-when-to-use-each-chatgpt-model/ \"open in a new window\"), OpenAI now has official advice on the best times to use each of its AI models. It would have been easy to miss, as the advice in question is attached to a [support document for ChatGPT Enterprise](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11165333-chatgpt-enterprise-models-limits \"open in a new window\"), the company's business-tier subscription service. And while there is some guidance that only applies to business users, much of the advice here applies to everyone. \n## When to use GPT-4o\nOpenAI advises users to use GPT-4o for everyday tasks. The company says that includes brainstorming, summarizing text, drafting and workshopping emails, and creative content--basically, the things the average user might expect ChatGPT to be good for. \nSome of the example prompts OpenAI suggest include summarizing meeting notes into \"key action items,\" generating an email after launching a project, proofreading a report you wrote, or brainstorming a launch plan in \"real time.\" For that last prompt, OpenAI encourages you to upload sketches or screenshots to aid the model in its response.\n## When to use GPT-4.5\nOpenAI [rolled out GPT-4.5 in preview earlier this year](https://lifehacker.com/tech/openai-is-leaning-on-paid-users-to-test-gpt-45). In fact, you'll need to pay for ChatGPT in order to access it, and even then, it's a bit hidden in the \"More models\" section of the model selector. \nIf you do have access to 4.5, OpenAI thinks you should try it out when you want the chatbot to help with tasks that involve \"emotional intelligence, clear communication, creativity, and a more collaborative, intuitive approach to brainstorming.\" At first glance, I don't really know what to make of that, since OpenAI also recommends GPT-4o for \"creative content,\" but the company does offer sample prompts.\nFor example, OpenAI thinks you should choose GPT-4.5 if you want to make an \"engaging\" LinkedIn post concerning trends in AI. (The irony.) The company also recommends the model if you have a new feature launching on your product, and you want an AI bot to write you a product description, or if you want to come up with an apology letter to a customer with an \"empathetic tone.\"\nIt seems the company wants you to use GPT-4.5 to replace most of your writing, including when you're supposed to be sharing a human moment with someone else. Personally, I'll keep writing my emails myself. \n## When to use ChatGPT's reasoning models\nReasoning models take a slightly different approach to generative AI than other models. The goal is to have the model break problems down step-by-step and \"think\" through each move, in order to end up with a more \"thoughtful\" and complete output. \n[The company's flagship reasoning model is o3](https://lifehacker.com/tech/openai-promises-chatgpt-o3-model-better-at-reasoning). The company recommends o3 for complex or multi-step tasks, including detailed plans and analyses, \"extensive\" coding, advanced math, science, and visual reasoning. Based on the example prompts, OpenAI sees you asking o3 to come up with a risk analysis for market expansion, generating a business strategy based on data from competitors, or running detailed analysis on a spreadsheet, while forecasting the upcoming quarter. \nI haven't personally put o3 through any of those paces. However, I did [hop on the viral trend last month of using the model for geoguessing](https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-o3-model-geoguessing). I had mixed results, but, more interestingly, the results were about the same when using gpt-4o instead. \nOn the flip side, there are the o4 reasoning models: o4-mini and o4-mini-high. These, according to OpenAI, have more focused use cases. o4-mini, for example, is for \"fast technical tasks,\" like extracting data points from a CSV file, summarizing a scientific article, or fixing an issue in Python. \no4-mini-high, on the other hand, is also good for technical tasks, but specifically ones that are more detailed--at least, according to OpenAI. That might include not only solving a hard math problem, but walking you through the steps, as well, or explaining a complex scientific concept in everyday language.\nWhile all users can access o4-mini, only paid subscribers can use o4-mini-high and o3. Free users only have limited access to o4-mini, as well. \nDespite the advice here, I still haven't found a regular use for any of ChatGPT's models. I don't code, so I can't speak to the bot's ability to help there, nor do I [enjoy generating AI art](https://lifehacker.com/the-ethics-of-making-and-publishing-ai-art-1850688734). The thing chatbots are best arguably best at, generating text, I do myself (I like to call it \"writing\") and I don't have any interest in outsourcing that work to a bot. For now, the main thing I'll continue to use ChatGPT for is testing out new features to cover here. \nMaybe a company like OpenAI will release a generative AI feature I do find regularly useful. That just hasn't happened yet. \n_Disclosure: Lifehacker 's parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems._",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "The Trump tariffs we've seen so far will increase costs for the average American household by about $4,900, according to an April [_analysis from The Budget Lab_](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025 \"open in a new window\") at Yale University. And as you're forced to spend more money on daily luxuries, it's all too easy to adjust to a new normal. I've [previously covered](https://lifehacker.com/how-much-do-small-daily-purchases-really-affect-your-l-1849328048) how too many people overstate the impact of your morning iced coffee on your long-term finances--but at the same time, it's all too easy to fall into the trap of spending more money on an everyday basis, which can make it difficult to save for the future.\nThis \"new normal\" of spending money falls under the umbrella of something known as \"lifestyle creep.\" And given the current state of [inflation](https://lifehacker.com/money/two-reasons-interest-rates-wont-be-dropping-anytime-soon) and tariffs alike, now is not the time to let all your small luxuries blow your budget out of proportion. While you [brace yourself for impact](https://lifehacker.com/money/what-todays-tariff-update-means-for-your-online-shopping-habit) during the ongoing trade war, be prepared to continue to alter your personal shopping habits. Here's what to know about the cost of lifestyle creep, and what you can do to avoid it.\n## What lifestyle creep is (and how to manage it)\nTypically, \"lifestyle creep\" is the pattern of spending more money as you earn more money. But even if you aren't making more money, given the state of inflation and tariffs, you may be slowly adjusting to a more expensive new normal. \nAnd remember, luxury is relative; for many, lifestyle creep is the difference between living paycheck-to-paycheck and realizing you can comfortably order DoorDash multiple nights a week. Unfortunately, even small luxuries can add up. And when dealing with economic forces beyond your control, it's best to reign in whatever inflated lifestyle costs you can control.\n## Make a budget and stick with it\nThe best budget is the one that works for you. There are [plenty of popular options to try out](http://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you), like the 50/20/30 method. Here's how that breaks down, in broad strokes:\n  * 50% of your monthly spending goes toward essentials. Your home, your transportation, your food, etc.\n  * 20% of your monthly spending goes toward savings goals. You can also group debt payments into this category, since paying down debt helps you build savings later.\n  * 30% of your monthly spending goes toward everything else. That might include your gym membership, travel, gifts, and dining.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no one magic spreadsheet out there. It may take some trial and error to find one that makes sense for your personal situation. Here's [my guide](https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-ways-budget-and-how-to-pick-the-best-one-for-you) to getting your budget started.\n## Become a more conscientious spender\nNow that you've made a budget, it's time to actually stick to it. One place to start is with your bank statements, reviewing whether all the things you're spending money on are actually valuable to you (and not [some subscription service you forgot about long ago](https://lifehacker.com/its-time-to-audit-your-autopay-subscriptions-1845328634)). You might be surprised to find how many expenses you'll be able to eliminate whether because they were unintentional or were motivated by stress.\nA simple tip to [avoid unnecessary purchases](https://lifehacker.com/stop-your-unconscious-spending-1849826638) is to write down the things you want to buy _before_ you buy them. When you read over items on this \"to-buy list,\" you'll be able to make a more thoughtful decision as to what you really _need._\n## Save money in a rainy day fund\nA major symptom of lifestyle creep is failing to grow your emergency fund. If the amount you are saving has remained static even after an increase in your income, chances are you're allocating that money to smaller lifestyle changes instead. Stay on top of how much you're saving and make sure it's rising with your earnings.\n## You're still allowed to treat yourself\nLiving below your means doesn't mean you need to live a life of austerity. Allow yourself to indulge occasionally in things that make you happy, especially if these indulgences improve your overall relationship with your money. It's important to treat yourself _thoughtfully_. Ask yourself, \"How do I expect this purchase will make me feel? What do I want it to make me feel? What feelings am I trying to _avoid_ by buying it?\" This might look like splurging on a family vacation, but cutting back on ordering take-out.\nWhen you feel confident that you're spending only on things you love and not wasting money on things you don't love, you will make much better big financial decisions.",

The new ear hooks are smaller, made out of nickel titanium alloy, making them flexible and durable. There are four sizes of eartips so you can get a tight seal to take advantage of the active noise-cancelling (ANC) and audio quality. \nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 are designed with working out in mind, which is why they're IPX4 water resistant and have a physical button to control media (as opposed to touch control). The charging case now has wireless charging and is smaller than the previous generation's gigantic case, but they're still bigger than the AirPods Pro 2. You can stretch the battery life to 10 hours with ANC off and about eight hours with ANC on (about twice what you get with the AirPods Pro 2).\nThe H2 chip is the same one that comes in the AirPods Pro 2. The media pauses automatically when you take the earbuds off, and it has a heart rate monitor that underperforms on each earbud (you can [read more about this in Beth's article](https://lifehacker.com/health/powerbeats-pro-2-track-your-heart-rate-from-your-ears-but-not-very-well)).

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Starting this week, Google will start rolling out the ability for kids under the age of 13 [to use Gemini on their own accounts](https://support.google.com/families/answer/16109150 \"open in a new window\"). Both on the web and through the Gemini mobile app, kids will be able to use Google Gemini to help with their homework, create songs, draft poems, and more.\nParents started getting notified about the update towards the end of last week, according to an email seen by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/technology/google-gemini-ai-chatbot-kids.html \"open in a new window\") and [Chrome Unboxed](https://chromeunboxed.com/my-son-is-going-to-be-so-excited-that-gemini-will-soon-be-available-on-his-phone/ \"open in a new window\"). It makes a major change for the company, and a bold one, too. While parents will receive an email the first time their child uses Gemini, AI access is nonetheless being added as a default, rather than an opt-in. Google does encourage talking to your kids about what to expect from the AI, but if you'd rather go beyond that, you can, at least, opt out.\n## How Google Gemini for kids works\nKids under the age of 13 will, once the update rolls out out to them, have automatic access to Gemini AI using the Gemini website and Gemini apps for iPhone and Android. This also includes personal assistant features on Android, which are now handled by Gemini instead of Google Assistant.\n[Google does say](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16109150#zippy=%2Cturn-off-a-childs-access-to-gemini-apps-in-older-versions-of-family-link \"open in a new window\") that kids accounts will have filters in place, and restrictions to make sure that your kids don't see anything that they aren't supposed to. It also says that the release will be gradual, and some features may not be available in certain regions. But the company warns that parents should still practice vigilance.\nGoogle suggests that you sit down with your kids to have a real, honest conversation about what AI is and how it works. According to Google, you should explain to your kids that Gemini isn't a real person, that it can [sometimes make things up](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-when-an-artificial-intelligence-is-hallucin-1850280001), and to always cross-check Gemini's work. Oh, and you should also tell them not to share any personal information with Gemini. All of this is solid advice not just for kids, but for anyone who uses AI tools.\n## How to disable access to Google Gemini for kids accounts\nGoogle Gemini access can be disabled and controlled using Google Family Link, which is Google's suite of parental controls. \nFirst, go to the [Family Link website](http://familylink.google.com/ \"open in a new window\") or open the Family Link app. Then choose your Child's account from the list.\nNext, go to **Controls** > **Gemini**. Disable the **Gemini Apps** feature to keep your kid from being able to access Google's AI on either the web or its mobile apps (at least using their own account).",

    "content": "If you're looking to send personal messages securely, [Signal is a great option](https://lifehacker.com/tech/signal-is-now-a-great-encrypted-alternative-to-zoom-google-meet). If you're a government official discussing classified information? Not so much. \nSo is the case with Trump administration officials: Last month, [we learned that highly sensitive war plans were being discussed in Signal group chats](https://lifehacker.com/tech/signal-is-private-sure-but-not-that-private), after Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally added to the conversation by then-U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. (Trump has since fired Waltz--and [then nominated him to be U.N. ambassador](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-waltz-offered-other-roles-before-u-n-ambassador/ \"open in a new window\").) \n## 'Signalgate' continues\nThere are many reasons why the administration's \"Signal strategy\" is problematic, but the issues didn't end there. On Thursday, [Reuters posted a photograph of Mike Waltz](https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/us-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-attends-a-cabinet-meeting-held-by-president-trump-at-the-white-house-in-washington/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX1JDMkg4RUFEOEtGRw%3D%3D?ref=404media.co \"open in a new window\") during a cabinet meeting at the White House. While there are plenty of important people in the photograph to pay attention to, [404 Media zeroed in on Waltz](https://www.404media.co/mike-waltz-accidentally-reveals-obscure-app-the-government-is-using-to-archive-signal-messages/ \"open in a new window\")--specifically, his iPhone. The outlet spotted that Waltz had what appeared to be a thread opened with officials like Tulsi Gabbard (Director of National Intelligence), Marco Rubio (Secretary of State), and JD Vance (Vice President), with the PIN verification message that Signal will routinely send to users to keep their credentials fresh in their minds. \nHowever, 404 Media spotted that this wasn't Signal's usual PIN verification pop-up: The message says \"TM SGNL PIN,\" which is the PIN verification screen for TeleMessage, a Signal \"clone\" that advertises itself as a way to archive your Signal messages. While the app claims it does not break Signal's secure messaging system to archive messages, 404 Media reports that the service as advertised has many security vulnerabilities. \nIt didn't take long for those vulnerabilities to manifest in disaster, either. On Sunday, [404 Media reported](https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/ \"open in a new window\") a hacker broke into TeleMessage's networks and stole customer data. While the hacker didn't take everything, they did obtain some DMs and group chats, in addition to data of modified versions of other chat apps, like WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat, all in about 15 to 20 minutes of hacking. 404 Media says the hacker did not access Waltz' chats or the conversations of any cabinet members, but they did access government officials' names and contact information, credentials to log into TeleMessage's backend panel (the tool that lets TeleMessage admins manage the service), as well as information that points to which agencies might use TeleMessage. \nSome of the stolen messages appeared to show a discussion about an ongoing effort to whip up votes in support of a cryptocurrency bill. One text read, \"Just spoke to a D staffer on the senate side - 2 cosponsors (Alsobrooks and gillibrand) did not sign the opposition letter so they think the bill still has a good chance of passage the senate with 5 more Ds supporting it.\" The hack didn't expose classified information, but it did reveal political conversations that the senders likely never intended to be printed in the press. \n## Why is TeleMessage insecure?\nTo understand why TeleMessage is not a secure service--and why it is unbelievable that a government agency would rely on it for classified conversations--you need to understand what makes Signal secure. \nSignal chats are end-to-end encrypted. That means when you talk to someone over the app, only you and the recipient can access the conversation. When you send a message, that text is encrypted in transit, and decrypted when it reaches the other user's device. If someone were to intercept the message in transit, it would look like a scramble of code--only the devices of the people in the chat can decrypt the message and return it to a readable form.\nBecause of this setup, not even Signal can access your messages. No authority can compel Signal to release your messages, since the company itself doesn't have access to the only thing that can decrypt the messages: your device. Even if someone hacked Signal's database, they'd be out of luck.\nTeleMessage, on the other hand, breaks that security chain. In order to archive those messages, TeleMessage must first intercept them as plain-text and store them. While the company says that they do so while maintaining security, the fact that this hacker was able to obtain DMs proves end-to-end encryption is broken. The stolen information was taken from data captured for \"debugging purposes,\" an unintended leak of decrypted data in TeleMessage's security chain. It doesn't matter if the service stores all messages in an encrypted archive: The company handles decrypted data in insecure ways, which leaves it open for hackers to access. \nEven before the hack, 404 Media was skeptical of the service's security, since they advertised archiving these \"end-to-end encrypted\" messages in Gmail, a platform that is infamously _not_ end-to-end encrypted. (Though TeleMessage said the Gmail aspect was just for a \"demo.\") The outlet also highlights how Signal does not guarantee the privacy and security of unofficial versions of their app. \n## Signal is great for personal use--not classified information\nSignal--and other end-to-end encrypted services like it--are great for personal security. Your messages cannot be accessed by anyone without physical access to the trusted devices involved, which goes a long way toward protecting your digital privacy. \nBut encryption isn't the only security concern here. There are still plenty of vulnerabilities and weak points when it comes to digital communication of any kind--end-to-end encryption included. \nHackers know that these messages can only be decrypted by the devices involved. So, a great way to break that security is to hack the devices themselves. Hackers use [malware like \"Pegasus\"](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-your-iphone-or-ipad-is-infected-with-peg-1847455178) to silently stow away onto a target's device and access sensitive data--encrypted data included. \nHackers routinely target high-profile individuals with this type of malware, so much so that [Apple issues a regular warning to affected users](https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-spyware-warning-is-real). Waltz is no exception: In the [view of Mike Casey](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/pete-hegseth-phone-signal.html \"open in a new window\"), the former director of National Counterintelligence and Center, there's a \"zero percent chance that someone hasn't tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on [Mike Waltz's] phone...he is one of the top five, probably, most targeted people in the world for espionage.\"\nOf course, that's just the concern with your own personal device. You also have to worry about the other end of the conversation. If you're chatting with someone over an encrypted chat app, and _their_ phone is compromised, it doesn't matter how secure _you_ are: Your messages are vulnerable. They don't even need to be hacked: They could leave their phone unlocked for anyone to pick up and access. And if you're talking in group chats--like Trump administration officials have been--the security implications only multiply. \nThere is risk involved in all digital communication: It's up to you to decide what risk level the data you're transferring is worth. For most personal conversations, you're probably just fine sticking with an encrypted service like Signal. If you're discussing details that could put lives at risk, however, [it might be best to keep it in the SCIF](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2023/scif-room-meaning-classified/ \"open in a new window\").",

In the latest Google Messages beta, these full-screen effects will now automatically play for you (and your texting partner, if they're also on the beta) when you send them certain emoji in Google Messages for Android. That makes them a bit easier to use than Apple's version of this feature, which can only be triggered by certain phrases (eg: \"Happy New Year\"), or by long-pressing the send button and selecting the effect manually. Google had previously rolled out full-screen effects [for certain phrases](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1aeqsgf/list_of_hidden_message_activated_full_screen/?rdt=59828 \"open in a new window\"), but this time around, all you need to do is send one emoji to trigger them.\n## How to use Android's full-screen message effects\nAt the moment, Google is still testing this new way to send full-screen message effects, which means you'll have to become a beta tester for Google Messages in order to try them out. To do that, either [follow this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.messaging/join \"open in a new window\") or go to the [Play Store page](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.messaging \"open in a new window\") for Google Messages, tap **Become a tester** , and follow the on-screen instructions. Once you have the beta up and running, just send an applicable emoji to any of your contacts to trigger its corresponding full-screen effect. Message effects aren't enabled for every single emoji, but they do work with quite a few commonly used ones, such as clap, sleep, party, etc. \nNote that you'll need to limit your text to just one emoji to see the effect. If you send an emoji along with some text, or more than one emoji, it won't work (prior versions of the feature required you to send two of the same emoji to trigger an effect, although I couldn't make that work on the new beta). Personally, I quite like how these effects look. It's like watching a short, animated video the moment you send an emoji, which makes for some really pleasing feedback.\n## How to turn off full-screen effects in Google Messages\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nUnless you find yourself frequently sending or receiving texts that only have a single emoji in them, these effects probably won't pop up so frequently that you'll need to turn them off. However, if they do start to annoy you, you can easily disable them. In Google Messages, tap the profile icon and select **Settings**. Disable **Show expressive animations** to stop seeing full-screen effects.",

While running requires minimal equipment compared to other activities, [the right footwear](https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-tell-if-your-running-shoes-fit-correctly) can make or break your experience--and your budget. Let's break down what various types of runners should expect to spend on shoes, which investments are worth it, and where you can save without compromising your running experience.\n## The casual beginner ($60-$90)\nIf you're just starting out with one or two short runs per week, or mixing running with other forms of exercise, you don't need to spend a fortune. Marketing will tempt you, but I promise, you shouldn't have to go over $100. \n**What to look for:** Simple cushioning, basic support, and comfort.\n**Worth investing in:** A proper fitting. Even at discount retailers like DSW or Famous Footwear, find someone who can watch you walk or run to ensure you're not severely [overpronating](https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-tell-if-your-running-shoes-fit-correctly).\n**Where to save:** Last year's models from major brands like [Nike](https://zdcs.link/zEgAyJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nike&short_url=zEgAyJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), [Adidas](https://zdcs.link/9852B7?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Adidas&short_url=9852B7&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), and [Asics](https://zdcs.link/QP8RyW?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Asics&short_url=QP8RyW&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") often hit the $60-90 range during clearance sales.

If you're running 20+ miles weekly, training for half or full marathons, or hitting the track for speedwork, your footwear becomes a crucial training tool.\n**What to look for:** Shoes specific to your running style, gait, and training needs.\n**Worth investing in:** A professional fitting at a specialty running store. The $10-20 premium you might pay for shoes is offset by expert guidance preventing injury. Consider a rotation of two complementary shoes--a cushioned model for long runs (like the [NUCLEO 2 at $160](https://zdcs.link/aDglZR?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NUCLEO%202%20at%20%24160&short_url=aDglZR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")) and a lighter, responsive shoe for faster workouts (like the [Saucony Kinvara at $119.95](https://zdcs.link/QKgxJn?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Saucony%20Kinvara%20at%20%24119.95&short_url=QKgxJn&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")).\n**Where to save:** Look for shoes with high mileage ratings (450-500+) to get more value per dollar. They might cost more upfront, but often outlast cheaper alternatives.\n**What to avoid:** Buying solely based on looks or trends. That Instagram-famous shoe might not work for your specific running style.\n[ Saucony Men's Kinvara 15  $119.95 at Amazon Shop Now  Shop Now  $119.95 at Amazon ](https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSaucony-Kinvara-Sneaker-Black-White%2Fdp%2FB0D8CPQDW1%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0D8CPQDW1%3Fmcid%3D2a61601be1cc301a95573c459bd682b7%26hvocijid%3D541717681394994320-B0D8CPQDW1-%26hvexpln%3D73%26tag%3Dhyprod-20%26linkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D721245378154%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D541717681394994320%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D9198314%26hvtargid%3Dpla-294505072980%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1&template=Explainers&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&position=1&element_label=Saucony+Men%27s+Kinvara+15&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&product_uuid=04MfCNmG7uwgWQWIkcOe7n5&offer_uuid=044j7OVqGLMyNfBLzmP8ait&pageview_type=RSS&object_type=044j7OVqGLMyNfBLzmP8ait&object_uuid=04MfCNmG7uwgWQWIkcOe7n5&data-aps-asin=B0D8CPQDW1&data-aps-asc-tag=lifehack088-20&data-aps-asc-subtag=044j7OVqGLMyNfBLzmP8ait \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")\n## The competitive racer ($160-$250+)\nFor serious competitors focused on performance, shoe technology becomes a legitimate competitive advantage. My word of advice: Don't spend money like a competitive racer unless you're confident this is your running identity.\n**What to look for:** Race-specific shoes with carbon plates, specialized foams, and performance-oriented features.\n**Worth investing in:** A proper \"super shoe\" for race day.

Again: [This science only matters](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a42723316/super-shoes-performance-effect/ \"open in a new window\") once you're running at true elite paces.\n**Where to save:** Reserve these expensive shoes exclusively for races and key workouts. For daily training, use more durable, less expensive models.\n**What to avoid:** Using these high-tech racing shoes for everyday training--they'll wear out quickly and you'll lose the \"special\" feeling on race day.\n## The minimalist ($80-$110)\nIf you prefer natural running with minimal interference between your foot and the ground, you can sometimes spend less--but not always.\n**What to look for:** Low drop (difference between heel and forefoot height), flexible materials, wide toe box.\n**Worth investing in:** Proper transition shoes if you're new to minimalist running.

Many road shoes can handle light trails, eliminating the need for multiple specialized trail models.\n**What to avoid:** Waterproof trail shoes unless you run in consistently cold, wet conditions--they're more expensive and less breathable.\n## What's never really worth it\nRegardless of your running style, here are some features that I constantly see marketed, but in my opinion never justify a higher price tag:\n  1. **Fashion collaborations:** Designer-branded running shoes typically add $30-50 without performance benefits. \n  2. **Gimmicky technology:** Be skeptical of proprietary features that can't be explained in simple terms.\n  3. **\"Smart\" shoes:** Shoes with smart tracking and embedded sensors are neat for about one day, but their [value proposition](https://www.wired.com/review/review-runtopia-reach-smart-running-shoes/ \"open in a new window\") can't compete with a [good running watch or app](https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-fitness-watches-for-runners).\n  4. **Limited edition designs:** While they look cool, they function identically to standard versions. As a runner, I understand the temptation. As a personal finance writer, I cannot endorse this type of spending.\n\n\n## Where everyone can save\nThe right shoes aren't just about performance--they're injury prevention tools. Some money-saving strategies work across all runner types:\n  * **Rotation to[extend life](https://www.essendonsportsmedicine.com.au/about/blog/the-runners-secret-weapon-the-power-of-rotating-shoes#:~:text=Rotating%20between%20different%20pairs%20of,their%20original%20structure%20and%20resilience. \"open in a new window\")****:** Using two pairs alternately can give each shoe time to decompress, allowing you to extend how long each pair lasts.\n  * **Outlet shopping:** Factory outlets for major brands often sell shoes at 30-40% below retail.\n  * **Timing purchases:** New models typically release annually, making previous versions excellent values.\n  * **Running specialty store loyalty programs:** Many offer discounts after multiple purchases or will price-match online retailers.\n\n\nRemember that the most expensive shoe isn't necessarily the best for you--it's about finding the right match for your specific needs, gait, and running goals. A proper fitting at a specialty running store is worth the time investment, even if you eventually purchase elsewhere.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Even if you're on top of your finances and never miss a payment, in the current economic climate, managing your bills can feel like swimming frantically and just keeping your head above water, with your paycheck evaporating before you even have a chance to appreciate it. If you're on salary and get paid bi-weekly, however, there are two months out of the year in which you are paid three times instead of two--and May is one of those months. \nBecause your [budget](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-a-simple-50-20-30-household-budget-1847941329) is probably based on getting paid twice per month, that thirdpay day can feel like a bonus--and it actually can serve you very well, if you play it smart. Here's how to make the most of this month's \"extra\" paycheck.\n## Don't budget for it\nStep one is to live your life like you only get paid 24 times every year. When setting up your budget and planning out your spending for the year (which you totally do...right?), you should pretend those two extra paychecks don't exist. If you count them in your income, they'll be absorbed into your everyday spending. That's not necessarily a bad thing (and you have no choice, if your financial situation calls for it), but the benefit will be diluted. If you want those extra paychecks to _feel_ like a bonus, start by forgetting all about them. Then when they roll in you, have a few smart ways to use them.\n## Put it into a savings account with interest\nThe most obvious smart way to use that third paycheck is to stash it in your savings--especially if you have a high-yield savings account (HYSA) you [can dump it into](https://lifehacker.com/yes-you-can-have-too-much-money-in-a-savings-account-1850999287). This puts that extra money to work for you, and gives you a little more breathing room during the rest of the year, or it can be put aside for future expenses like holiday shopping, a vacation you've planned, or a big purchase you know is coming up.\nIf you're saving that third paycheck you need to have a plan for it. If you just leave it in your bank account there's a risk it will just evaporate over time as you dip into it here and there when your budget gets a little busted. Again, using it to cover overages isn't exactly a bad use of the money you earned, but it might not be the most impactful.\n## Invest it\nA better option might be to invest the money. If you have [retirement accounts](https://lifehacker.com/money/concrete-ways-to-increase-your-retirement-savings), you can look into making extra contributions to help Future You have a more comfortable retirement plan. If you don't have a retirement account, creating one with that extra paycheck could be the best thing you do all year--[setting up](https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ways-to-spend-or-invest-that-10-000-1849461953) an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is pretty easy, and if you make a habit of stuffing your third paychecks into that IRA every year you'll be very glad you did. Alternatively, if you already have an investment portfolio you can apply that paycheck there and beef up your holdings.\n## Invest in yourself\nSpeaking of investment, don't forget about investing in yourself. That bonus paycheck could be used to make your future brighter in several ways:\n  * [**Professional development**](https://lifehacker.com/work/most-in-demand-job-skills)**.** Using that extra money to earn a credential that can help you get promoted or find a better job can pay off in the long term without impacting your daily life.\n  * **Deferred healthcare.** If you've been holding off on [dental work](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-prepare-for-the-dentist-if-you-havent-been-in-fo-1850931921) or some other form of big-ticket healthcare due to the cost, a third paycheck offers an opportunity to do some very necessary self-care.\n  * **Lifestyle improvement.** You could also use the bonus paycheck to pay for a [gym membership](https://lifehacker.com/what-to-expect-the-first-time-you-go-to-the-gym-1848315805) or equipment to jump-start an exercise regimen that will pay off handsomely.\n\n\n## Start a business\nA little extra cash can be used to launch a lucrative side hustle (many of these little businesses don't [require much--or any--startup cash](https://lifehacker.com/work/businesses-with-zero-upfront-costs)) or [small business](https://lifehacker.com/all-the-questions-to-ask-before-starting-your-own-busin-1832880662). If you've had an idea for a service or product that you think could be turned into a money-making endeavor, that third paycheck might be all the startup capital you need to get it off the ground.\n## Create an emergency fund\nDistinct from your general savings, an [emergency fund](https://lifehacker.com/money/where-you-should-and-shouldnt-keep-your-emergency-fund) protects you from [unexpected disasters](https://lifehacker.com/money/most-common-emergencies-you-should-save-for) that would otherwise _wipe out_ your savings and leave you in a terrible financial position.__ These include job loss, medical emergencies, and home repairs, any of which could spell doom if you're not ready for them. Since we live in a world where [42% of Americans don't have any sort of emergency fund](https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-financial-wellness-survey \"open in a new window\") at all, setting that extra paycheck aside specifically for that purpose is a very smart idea.\n## Pay down debt\nYou're living in the world, which means you're most likely carrying debt--it's just a fact of modern life. If you have sufficient savings and an emergency fund, chipping away at your debt is a terrific use for an extra paycheck:\n  * **Pay down credit cards.** The interest rates credit cards charge can be insane, and if you're paying just minimum payments each month it will take you a very, very long time to erase even a modest balance. A balloon payment thrown at the card charging the most interest can be a dramatic improvement in your financial outlook moving forward.\n  * **Make an extra mortgage payment.** If you have a mortgage on your house and the two third paychecks you get every month allows you to make two extra payments, you can literally shave _years_ off your mortgage. For example, if you have a $300,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.75% interest, your principal and interest comes out to $1,946 per month. If you can throw 2 extra payments totaling $3,900 per year using your two third paychecks, you can [shave 10 years off your mortgage term](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=300%2C000&cloanterm=30&cinterestrate=6.75&cremainingyear=30&cremainingmonth=0&cpayoffoption=extra&cadditionalmonth=0&cadditionalyear=3%2C900&cadditionalonetime=0&type=1&x=Calculate#loanterm \"open in a new window\") and save $145,000 in interest.\n  * **Other debt.** Any other kinds of debt you're carrying can be reduced or eliminated, of course--student loan debt, personal loans, auto loans. As long as there's no penalty for paying more than the monthly payment, you can whittle these down by applying that third paycheck.\n\n\nIt's not often we get a break in this world. An extra paycheck is one of those times--but only if you make a plan to take advantage of it.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Apple has been under fire for several years after it was discovered that Siri violated user privacy, and the company earlier this year [agreed to a $95 million settlement](https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-siri-lawsuit-settlement) to resolve a class action lawsuit, which includes compensation for affected users. Eligible individuals [can now apply](https://www.lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com/ \"open in a new window\") for their share of the total. \nThe dispute centered on Siri-enabled devices, including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, iPod touch, and Apple TV, which may have activated and recorded and shared private conversations without user knowledge. \nIf you qualify for the settlement class, you'll receive $20 for each device claimed--up to five devices per individual for a total of $100--though it could be less if too many class members come forward. \n## Am I eligible for a Siri settlement payout? \nThe settlement covers Siri-enabled Apple devices purchased or owned between Sept. 17, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2024. If you can attest that your device accidentally triggered Siri during a private or confidential conversation, you're eligible for a payout. Individuals can submit claims for up to five Siri devices. \nThe deadline to submit a claim is July 2, 2025, though it could take awhile to actually see any settlement cash. The court is scheduled to hold a final approval hearing on the case on August 1, and appeals after that meeting could delay payouts. \n## How to submit a Siri settlement claim\nTo claim your piece of the Siri settlement pie, you'll need to [submit a claim form online](https://www.lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com/submit-claim \"open in a new window\"). If you received a personalized postcard or email about the suit containing a claim identification number (Notice ID) and confirmation code, you'll use those to log into the site and begin the claims process. \nIf you didn't get a notice but believe you are eligible, select New Claim. You'll need to fill out some personal information--name, address, phone number, and email--as well as the email address attached to your Siri device(s). You'll also need to either upload proof of purchase for each device you are claiming or provide the serial and model numbers. To finalize the form, select a payment option, complete the attestation statement, and hit Submit. \nAlternatively, you can do nothing--or you can opt out of the settlement. You won't receive any money in either situation, but with the latter, you retain your right to sue Apple in the future on claims related to this case. Instructions for requesting exclusion (also with a July 2 deadline) are detailed on the [settlement page FAQ](https://www.lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com/faqs \"open in a new window\").",

They also said you can get much better headphones for less than their $349.99 price (which is [very true](https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-over-ear-headphones)) that have adjustable EQ and better active noise cancelling (ANC). However, at $169.95, these headphones are a great deal, especially if you're an Apple user.\nThese headphones have hands-free Siri access, one-touch pairing on iOS and Android devices (through Google Fast Pair), which gives simultaneous connections with up to two devices, and a transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings. Apple users will be able to take advantage of the AAC [_codecs_](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-are-bluetooth-codecs-a-guide-to-everything-from-aac-to-sbc \"open in a new window\"), which work seamlessly with Apple to give much better audio quality, but have limitations with Android devices. You get a quick-access menu to control the ANC and Transparency modes, and you can also use the Find My app if you misplace your headphones. \nThe biggest miss with the Beats Studio Pro that you would expect any premium headphones to have is an adjustable EQ. However, they have plenty of EQ presets for you to choose from. The ANC is slightly above average, which is good for its current price. You can get about 40 hours of playtime at full charge with ANC and Transparency modes off, and a 10-minute charge gives you about four hours of juice.",

[PCMag gave it an Editor's Choice award](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/arlo-pro-3-floodlight-camera \"open in a new window\"), mostly thanks to its 2K HDR video, wide 160-degree field of view, and a super bright (up to) 3,000-lumen floodlight.

The image/video quality holds up well, especially during the day--crisp, colorful, and clear.

    "title": "24 of the Best Dramas on Netflix Right Now",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nYou'd think we get enough drama from news and social media--but honestly, we live for it. Netflix has stories of tortured romance; parental struggles; political victories; and all manner of triumphs and tragedies, whether entirely fictional or inspired by true events. \n## _Past Lives_ (2023)\nGreta Lee plays Nora, whose family emigrated from South Korea to the United States when she was a child. Years later, and then over the course of several years, she reunites with childhood friend Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), forcing an examination of her life as it is, and as it might have been. Certainly among the best of the last five years, the film's exploration of roads not taken builds to a powerful emotional punch. **You can stream _Past Lives_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81700118 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Two Popes_ (2019)\nWith a bit of extra relevance in recent days, this biographical film from director Fernando Meirelles (_City of God_) dramatizes a key period in the relationship between then-Pope Benedict XVI and his soon-to-be successor, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later Francis). Following the Vatican leaks scandal of 2012, Benedict (Anthony Hopkins) finds himself weakened both physically and in terms of his authority--as he considers resigning the Papacy, he summons Bergoglio (Jonathan Pryce), the leading contender to replace him. The two debate theology and struggle with their own futures in a near two-hander than earned each of the actors Academy Award nominations. **You can stream _The Two Popes_[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80174451 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Six Triple Eight_(2024)\nTyler Perry directs this war drama, and it's likely his best movie yet, with a powerhouse lead performance from Kerry Washington as the real-life Major Charity Adams, commanding officer of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. During World War II, a backlog in mail delivery was causing tremendous harm to troop morale, and so this battalion of Black women was charged with getting letters delivered; Perry's greatest achievement here is making an extremely convincing case for the significance of mail sorting. Once deployed to Germany, the women come under fire from enemy soldiers, as well as from fellow allied soldiers who see no place for women, and particularly Black women, in wartime. **You can stream _The Six Triple Eight_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81590591 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Long Game_ (2023)\nThe drama here is quietly understated, though the stakes are very real. Jay Hernandez heads up the cast here to tell the true story of a group of teens from Del Rio, Texas of the 1950s, who set out to play golf at a white country club as the San Felipe Mustangs. They could be _caddies_ , of course--but to actually play?! The kids went on to win the 1957 Texas State High School Golf Championship, with _Long Game_ dramatizing the triumphs, setbacks, and _extremely_ overt racism on the road to that victory. **You can stream _The Long Game_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81766487 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Society of the Snow_ (2023)\nThe true story of the 1972 Uruguayan rugby team lost in the Andes following a plane crash has been the subject of multiple documentaries and two previous dramas (the best known being, almost certainly, Frank Marshall's cannibalism-heavy _Alive_ from 1993). For all that Andes-crash content, this is the best of all of them: a thoughtful and tasteful take on what's sometimes been presented as a salacious drama, with director J. A. Bayona emphasizing both the physical perils faced by the team and the spiritual toll of survival. **You can stream _Society of the Snow_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81268316 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Ma Rainey's Black Bottom_ (2020)\nSweaty, smoky clubs; outspoken (often openly queer) women who accepted no bullshit--women like Bessie Smith, Lucille Bogan, Gladys Bentley, and, of course, Ma Rainey. The 1920s blues scene was a _moment_ , and Wolfe's movie goes a long way to resurrecting the era with its contained but explosive story of one stormy Chicago recording session. Based on August Wilson's play, it's packed with brilliant performances, led by Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman in his final film role. **You can stream _Ma Rainey's Black Bottom_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81100780 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Power of the Dog_ (2021)\nJane Campion came roaring back after an absence from the director's chair of a decade or so, with this, the most acclaimed film of her career to date. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Phil Burbank, as beguiling as he is cruel, who runs a family ranch in 1925 with his far gentler brother, George (Jesse Plemons). Phil's callousness sparks into flame when George finds love with a local waitress (Kirsten Dunst), his brother's happiness shifting their power dynamic uncomfortably, and leaving Phil to contemplate (or, rather, to avoid contemplating) his feelings for the man who taught him how to be a cowboy years earlier. **You can stream _The Power of the Dog_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81127997 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Shirley_ (2024) \nA _woman president_? What's next?! Academy Award winner John Ridley (screenwriter of _12 Years a Slave_) directs this quite necessary biopic of sometimes-forgotten pioneer Shirley Chisholm. The first Black woman elected to Congress (in 1969), Chisolm ran a forcefully progressive campaign for president just three years later. Even if the movie is a bit formulaic, in the ways that these things sometimes are, Regina King (perhaps unsurprisingly) gives a moving, illuminating performance as the idiosyncratic trailblazer. **You can stream Shirley[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81473752 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society_ (2018)\nCharmingly unwieldy name aside,_Guernsey_ is a cute and clever period drama based on the popular novel from Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. Lily James stars as Juliet Ashton (pen name: Izzy Bickerstaff), a writer in 1946 who finds herself entranced by the titular society, formed during the German occupation of the island. Like the book before it, the quirkiness of the story's characters masks dark undertones related to the horrors of the just-concluded war, lending the film a surprising emotional depth. Mike Newell (_Four Weddings and a Funeral_ , _Donnie Brasco_) directs. **You can stream _The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80223371 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Anyone but You_ (2023)\nA loose spin on _Much Ado About Nothing_ , _Anyone But You_ stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell as a couple who meet, hit it off for about a minute--and then immediately start to get on each other's nerves. Until, of course, they need wedding dates and find themselves surrounded by scheming friends. As Shakespeare taught us, of such inauspicious beginnings are great romances sometimes born. It's not wildly out there as rom-com premises go, but the movie is briskly directed and boasts strong chemistry (a must) between Sweeney and Powell. **You can stream _Anyone but You_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81760229 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Beginners_ (2010)\nBetter late than never: That's the message of _Beginners_ , in which Hal, played by Christopher Plummer (beginning his own late-career resurgence) comes out to his son, Oliver (Ewan McGregor). As Hal begins to live his life more openly and finds love with a younger man, he also develops a more honest relationship with his son. As a result, the two become closer than they ever were before, and their relationship inspires Oliver to pursue a new romance of his own--and to generally live life on his own terms. It's a movie about how, sometimes, being true to yourself is the best way to be a good parent. **You can stream _Beginners_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/70148804 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Do the Right Thing_ (1989)\nDirector Spike Lee had his greatest triumph with this funny, quotable, and ultimately explosive film about the racial tensions percolating in a Brooklyn neighborhood on a hot summer day. Stylish, funny, humane, and, ultimately, a gut punch. **You can stream _Do the Right Thing_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/448860 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Scoop_ (2024)\nThe reliably great Gillian Anderson plays real-life British journalist Emily Maitlis, who lead the BBC2 team that secured the disastrous interview with Prince Andrew (Rufus Sewell) that laid bare his associations with sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein--and by \"disastrous,\" I mean that it was a disaster for the Prince, who couldn't seem to stop himself from making things worse. A juicy and compelling true story. Keeley Hawes and Billie Piper also star. **You can stream _Scoop_[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81600418 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Passing_ (2021)\nThis gorgeous black-and-white adaptation of the once-controversial 1929 novel explores the dramatized history of some light-skinned African-Americans attempting to pass as white. Ruth Negga and Tessa Thompson play old friends who reunite unexpectedly after years apart; one is married to a Black man and living in Harlem while the other is married to an odious, racist white doctor who has no idea his wife isn't the woman he thinks she is. The fallout both women experience as a result of their chance encounter is an indictment of a society that would place so much value on skin color, yes, but it's also a challenging consideration of the choices people will make for self-preservation, and it offers no easy answers. **You can stream _Passing_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81424320 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _May December_ (2023)\nTodd Haynes directs this insightful, moving, and also deliberately campy story of an actress visiting the woman she'll be playing in a film. The movie's deft, and unexpected, blending of tones makes it pretty consistently fascinating, and the lead performances from Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton saw them all as Oscar nomination frontrunners, even if no actual nods were forthcoming. **You can stream _May December_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81702955 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Carol_ (2015)\nThe chemistry between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol is palpable from the moment their eyes meet across a crowded department store--but it's the 1950s, and theirs is a love that dare not speak its name, even to one another. That's just how things were back then (luckily, queerphobia has been entirely eradicated). The women suffer for their love in Todd Haynes' modern classic, but the tears come less when things are going bad as when it starts to feel like they might just possibly start to go a little right. **You can stream _Carol_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80058700 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Nyad_ (2023)\nAnnette Bening stars as the real-life Diana Nyad, who swam from Florida to Cuba in her 60s--powered largely by an unyielding willfulness. The movie succeeds in large part because of the performances from and chemistry between lead Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, both of whom received Oscar nominations for their work here. The movie makes a strong case that age is inevitably a weakness in many ways, but can also be a source of surprising strength. **You can stream _Nyad_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81447231 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Lost Daughter_ (2021)\nInspired, in part, by ancient Greek mythology, this psychological drama was probably never destined to be a crowd-pleaser--but it's a genuinely confident, bold debut from writer/director Maggie Gyllenhaal. Olivia Colman (who got a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her trouble) plays Leda Caruso, a middle-aged college professor who develops a rather disturbing obsession with a woman and her young daughter while on holiday in Greece. Jessie Buckley also got an Oscar nod for playing a younger version of Leda, and Gyllenhaal picked up a nomination for her screenplay. **You can stream _The Lost Daughter_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81478910 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind_ (2019)\nChiwetel Ejiofor wrote and directed (also co-starred) in the biographical, family-friendly (in the best sense) film based not he memoir of William Kamkwamba (played here by Maxwell Simba). Born to a family of farmers in Kasungu, Malawi, William barely manages to stay in school (essentially blackmailing a teacher in lieu of being able to afford tuition), but his persistence pays off: the young engineering prodigy develops a design for a windmill that might be able to save the village from the impacts of drought and a global economic downturn--but only if he can convince his family that the sacrifices required to build his machine will be worth it. **You can stream _The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind_[here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80200047 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Judy_ (2019)\nRenee Zellweger won an Oscar for her portrayal of screen legend Judy Garland in this biopic that focuses on the last year of her life, contrasting the period of trial with scenes from her early life, and drawing straight lines between the treatment of a child actor with the troubles of an aging star. There are some biopic tropes here, and the film builds to a necessarily tragic conclusion, but there's a great deal of heart and humanity here, and Zellweger offers up a very worthy performance. **You can stream J _udy_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/80223104 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Twilight_ (2008)\nSay what you like about Catherine Hardwicke's adaptation of the Stephenie Meyer's novel: the movie was a blockbuster and a genuine pop culture phenomenon, touching on the drama and trauma of teen romance in grand, nearly operatic, style. The movie was released during the country's last major economic downturn, and some sparkly vampires might be just the comfort watch you need in more recently troubling times. **You can stream _Twilight_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/70099113 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Goodfellas_ (1990)\nMartin Scorsese's epic take on the life of real-life mobster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is an indisputable classic of the genre--in fact, it's the movie people think of first when you mention gangster movies. Scorsese has rarely been better, but the movie's performances (from Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci) are where it soars. **You can stream _Goodfellas_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/70002022 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _Rustin_ (2023)\nColman Domingo gives a stellar performance (he earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination) as the title's Bayard Rustin, the gay Civil Rights leader who planned the March on Washington. Domingo is all charm here as a man desperate to advance a movement focused on his skin color but is less certain how to treat his sexuality. Not only is it an intersectional corrective to our very straight-centered vision of the Civil Rights Movement, it's a stylish and moving biopic in its own right. **You can stream _Rustin_ h[ere](https://www.netflix.com/title/81111528 \"open in a new window\")****.**\n* * *\n## _The Boys in the Band_ (2020)\nAn update of the 1968 play (previously adapted to the screen by William Friedkin in 1970), _Boys in the Band_ keeps its period setting and premise: Michael (Jim Parsons) is hosting a very gay birthday for his friend Harold (Zachary Quinto), joined by their friends Donald (Matt Bomer) and Larry (Andrew Rannells). Everyone's ready to cut loose without the pressure of having to act straight--until they're joined unexpectedly by married Alan (Brian Hutchison), and everyone has to decide how far they're willing to shove themselves back in the closet. **You can stream _The Boys in the Band_ [here](https://www.netflix.com/title/81000365 \"open in a new window\")****.**",

    "title": "Windows Has an Emergency Restart Option You Probably Don’t Know About (and I’m Not Talking About Ctrl+Alt+Del)",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "The old turn-it-off-and-on-again adage has helped successfully [troubleshoot computers](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-try-out-windows-new-blue-screen-of-death) for years, but there's more than one way to restart your hardware and software--including a lesser known option on Windows that may well be new to you. It starts with the familiar Ctrl+Alt+Del keystroke, but doesn't end there.\nHaving spent many years writing about tech, it isn't often that I come across something I didn't already know about. So when I stumbled across [this old BetaNews article](https://betanews.com/2023/06/15/how-to-access-the-hidden-emergency-restart-option-in-microsoft-windows/ \"open in a new window\") about an emergency restart feature in Windows, I was taken aback.\nIt showed a screen and a keystroke combination I had genuinely never heard of before. A bit more digging revealed that this has been in Windows [for decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0mjQ6jou1k \"open in a new window\"), making it even stranger that I'd never come across it.\nOfficial information on this emergency restart in Windows seems to be thin on the ground, or has perhaps been lost to time. Essentially though, it seems to replicate what a long press on your PC's power button would do: A quick, no-questions-asked reboot of your computer, with the minimum of fuss.\nThe Windows enthusiasts [over on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vqcf67/windows_undocumented_emergency_restart/ \"open in a new window\") have spotted this feature before, and there appear to be [plenty of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/1aihb6t/i_bet_many_people_dont_even_know_about_this/ \"open in a new window\") on the boards who hadn't come across it until their attention was drawn toward it. If you dig into those threads you'll find some technical information on what exactly is going on behind the scenes, and the different calls that the feature might be making.\nIt's worth emphasizing that this is very much a last resort option, as indeed the feature itself will tell you. You're not going to get a chance to save anything you're working on, as is the case if you force a reboot by pressing and holding the power button.\n## How to access the emergency restart option\nUse at your own risk. Credit: World of OSes\nIf all is well with your Windows computer, you can of course click the Start menu button on the taskbar, then the power button on the right, and then **Restart**. But what if your computer has crashed and left you hanging, so you can't click anything? What if the situation is so bad that the Start menu has mysteriously disappeared?\n### Start with Ctrl+Alt+Del\nTo get to the emergency restart option, you need to first press the familiar **Ctrl+Alt+Del** keyboard shortcut, known by pretty much everyone who's ever had to fix a Windows PC at some point. This shortcut is designed to work even if your computer is otherwise unresponsive, and gives you access to options for locking your PC, signing out of your account, and bringing up the Task Manager.\nBut down in the lower right corner, there's also a power button: Click this, and you get the standard **Sleep** , **Shut down** , and **Restart** options. However, if you hold down **Ctrl** and _then_ click the power button, that takes you to the emergency restart page, together with the warning about losing any unsaved data. Click **OK** , and your computer will reboot itself almost instantly.\nIf you can get to the screen after **Ctrl+Alt+Del** , then you'll want to try the normal restart option first--you'll only need to go down the holding **Ctrl** route if that doesn't work. Presumably, that will be because there's a program or a part of the Windows code that isn't shutting down properly to clear the way for a restart.\nShould you need yet another way of restarting your computer without using the Start menu, you can do it from the command prompt or PowerShell utility, too: Just type \"shutdown /r\" and hit **Enter**. There are a host of extra flags you can add to that command if needed, including setting a timer for the restart and forcing applications to close: You can [read full instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/shutdown \"open in a new window\").\nHaving now familiarized myself with the emergency restart option in Windows, I'm off to find more features that I haven't come across--even though they've been around for years. Any suggestions are most welcome.",

    "title": "PopClip Is Like a Supercharged Right Click for Text on Mac",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Everyone works with text while on their Macs, and [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app/ \"open in a new window\") is a simple and effective way to speed up all your text workflows. On the surface, it's really simple. The app, also available on mobile, simply adds a small popover menu to your screen every time you select text on your Mac. By default, it gives you access to four commonly used actions: search, cut, copy, and paste. This alone is good enough for most people, but the app can do a lot more.\nMobile is a bit more limited, but on Mac, you can customize the popover menu by adding or removing features, and there's a big [extension directory](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/ \"open in a new window\") to make this even better. With some tweaking, you can use it for relatively basic operations such as text transformations, or more advanced ones such as sending text to the translation service of your choice. PopClip's free trial lets you use text actions 250 times, and once you've exhausted those, you can buy the app for $12 or $25. The lower price guarantees two years of updates, after which you can continue using it without new features, but if you pay more, you get access to app updates for as long as PopClip is in active development.\n## Customizing PopClip\nCredit: Pranay Parab\nCustomizing PopClip is a bit annoying, because the app's window is quite small and uses tiny font sizes. Click its menu bar icon to get started. The good news is that you won't have to use the menu bar window much, so I can look past its tiny size and barebones UI. In the app's window, begin by clicking the home icon, which will allow the app to launch at login. This way, you won't have to keep activating PopClip every time you restart your Mac.\nNext, go to the gear icon tab and change the size and position (above or below the selected text) of the popover menu to suit your needs. A larger size is more intrusive, but it makes it easier to click the buttons in the menu. On the same page, you can record a keyboard shortcut to access PopClip without using the mouse, too. The next tab has a puzzle piece icon, and it lets you configure your actions or add additional actions not included in the default set, like translation or dictionary tools. Uncheck the options you don't use, and drag the four dots next to each action upwards or downwards to reorder them.\nFinally, go to the next tab to customize a list of excluded apps. PopClip's menus won't appear when you select text in those apps.\n## Adding extensions to supercharge the app\nCredit: Pranay Parab\nPopClip's real magic comes from its extension support. Just go to the [extensions directory](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/ \"open in a new window\") page, select any extensions you like, download them, and open the downloaded files. This automatically adds those extensions to PopClip. Simply go to back to the puzzle piece icon in the settings to see your new additions. There are plenty of extensions on this page, and it can be hard to stop adding them to the app, because most of them are quite useful. The extensions page even has [an RSS feed](https://public.popclip.app/extensions/popclip.rss \"open in a new window\"), and you can add it to the [RSS reader of your choice](https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-rss-reader-apps-for-iphone-and-mac) to get informed whenever a new tool shows up. \nIt's hard to make a definitive list of the best PopClip extensions, since that depends on what you want to do with the app. Personally, I like to select text and send it into third-party apps (to quickly create to-dos or calendar entries, translate text, etc.), and there are plenty of great actions for that. I'm also a big fan of the [Append to Clipboard](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/1yw6jd \"open in a new window\") action, which lets me copy multiple bits of text and adds it all to the clipboard. This way, I can quickly copy an excerpt and add the article's URL to the clipboard, then paste them both to a social media post in one go. Without PopClip, that would require pasting twice, plus switching between tabs.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: 100 Men vs. One Gorilla",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "This week, the Out-of-Touch Guide grapples with an eternal question of man vs. beast, sees Gen Z throw a hilarious right cross at millennial decorating trends, contemplates whether refusing to wash your face is a skincare routine or a cry for help, and explains why serving booze at weddings has become a generational flashpoint.\n## What is \"100 men vs. 1 Gorilla?\"\nIn [a video posted three years ago](https://www.tiktok.com/@yuri5kpt2/video/7067705291957079342 \"open in a new window\"), TikToker [yuri5kpt2](https://www.tiktok.com/@yuri5kpt2 \"open in a new window\") was the first online to ask a seemingly simple question: who would win in a fight between 100 men and a single gorilla? It took some time for the general population to catch on to this intriguing hypothetical, but critical mass was achieved this week, and the debate has spread everywhere online. \nMy first thought was 100 men are taking it, without a doubt. I mean, it's a _hundred_ guys! But then I considered the overwhelming power of an enraged gorilla, how it could literally tear off limbs and bite off faces, and the scale started tipping heavily the other way. I mean, _look_ at this thing:\n> On the other hand, actual primatologist Dr. Tara Stoinski gives it to humans:\n> But I don't think she's considering the panic factor. If the question assumes 100 average dudes with no training, I'm guessing about 99 of them run screaming as soon as the most unlucky of the bunch has his face bitten off. I know I would. But the gorilla is going to panic when it sees a mob of 100 men screaming at the top of their lungs! \nThen there's stamina to consider. According to this (self-proclaimed) animal expert, the gorilla would be gassed after killing 30 or 40 dudes, so the men would ultimately triumph, but only after taking heavy casualties.\n> Right now, I'm leaning slightly toward humans, based on the combined stamina of 100 people and our natural survival instinct. This is the kind of question that won't be answered until someone does it for real, and good luck making that happen with all the \"laws\" we have.\nBecause this is 2025, the question couldn't be left to quietly drift away like previous internet imponderables like \"[what would you do if a super intelligent, deadly snail was following you?](https://lifehacker.com/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-what-is-t-1847959243)\" Instead, it's become a part of the tedious [\"gender wars\"](https://www.dailydot.com/memes/100-men-vs-meme/ \"open in a new window\") with people hijacking the format to ask questions like, \"[Can we get 100 women vs. accountability?](https://www.tiktok.com/@therealbigwinnn/video/7497421055447797023 \"open in a new window\")\" Responses include \"[how about 100 men vs. shutting the fuck up?](https://x.com/The8BitIdiot/status/1917414483581903353 \"open in a new window\")\" Can we just have one fight between a gorilla and 100 men without people ruining it?\n## What is \"caveman skincare?\"\nMoving up the evolutionary ladder from gorillas, we have \"caveman skincare,\" a minimalist approach to personal hygiene that involves not washing your face, or at least not using soap. The idea has been kicking around since at least the 1960s, but TikToker [Tia Zakher](https://www.tiktok.com/@tiazakher?lang=en \"open in a new window\") brought it to the world's attention in April by documenting her experiment of not applying any products to her face, or even washing it at all. The idea is to \"reset\" your skin to a more natural, and presumably healthier, state. The result is not exactly pretty.\n> But this is temporary, at least according to Zakher. She says the uneven, bumpy skin on her face is a build-up of dead skin cells that would normally be washed away, and underneath is healthy, clear skin. Most commenters don't seem to agree, and suggest that it's actually a fungal infection, or maybe she's rage-baiting, faking it for the attention, or it's just gross.\nThere's a lot going on here culturally. Widespread interest in the technique seems like a backlash to the elaborate, expensive skincare routines many people feel they need, and the online trashing of Zakher is depressingly predictable, given that she's a young woman who is doing something other than presenting herself as alluringly as possible. But all that aside, is this actually a good idea? According to dermatologists, not really, but a little, maybe, kind of.\n\"It could temporarily help some people whose skin is extremely irritated from overuse of products, as it reduces the chances of chemical irritation,\" dermatologist Dr. Angela J. Lamb [told Teen Vogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dermatologists-explain-tiktok-viral-caveman-method \"open in a new window\"), but she added that if you're still wearing makeup and working out, not washing will likely clog your pores and could make acne worse or lead to fungal infections.\nAccording to another dermatologist quoted by Teen Vogue _,_ Dr. Asmi Berry, the caveman method is not backed by scientific evidence, and there's a better approach to dealing with strengthening your skin. \"Stick to a gentle cleanser, a hydrating moisturizer, and a mineral sunscreen,\" Dr. Berry suggests.\n## What is millennial green and why is it so cringe?\nMaybe it's my inner mean girl, but I can't get enough of members of Generations Z noticing lame details about millennial culture and savagely roasting them for it. First it was being overly into Harry Potter, then eating at [millennial burger joints](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-cookie-king-brain-rot), and now it's \"[millennial green](https://www.dailydot.com/culture/millennial-green-sad-beige/ \"open in a new window\").\" \nSometimes called \"sage\" or \"forest green,\" Millennial green is an evolution of the \"[sad beige](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sad-beige-parenting-trend_l_63c5cf84e4b0cbfd55f587f3 \"open in a new window\")\" aesthetic from a few years ago. It hovers around here on the [Pantone scale](https://www.pantone.com/ \"open in a new window\"):\nCredit: Pantone\nOnce you notice it, you notice it _everywhere_ --just as evolution [eventually leads to crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation \"open in a new window\"), all decorating eventually leads to millennial green. \nI love this trend because millennials are still young enough to care what kids think of their decorating choices, and they're posting funny/poignant videos about discovering that they're not cool:\n> Wait, I just realized that Lifehacker's color is kind of a millennial green. We're not super cringe, are we? Oh my god. I'm going to rethink my life now. \n## Gen Z and cash bars at weddings\nOK, I'm back. Our website may be millennial green, but at least Lifehacker understands the importance of free booze at weddings. With June marriage season approaching, many young people are defending the practice of charging their guests for drinks at their weddings. This is against the order of nature and should not be allowed. \nCheck out the discussion in this X comment section:\n> [ This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. ](https://twitter.com/hotdamhistorian/status/1914364143089623041 \"open in a new window\")\nOn the other side of the debate are Gen Z members calling people \"alcoholics\" for expecting free drinks. \nSeriously, people should be able to have whatever kind of wedding they'd like, but this debate highlights another cultural divide between Gen Z and We Who Have Come Before: Youngsters [aren't drinking as much as previous generations](https://time.com/7203140/gen-z-drinking-less-alcohol/ \"open in a new window\"), proving that the real generation gap isn't about napkin colors; it's whether you think vodka should come with a price tag.\n## Viral video of the week: I Hid in Viral YouTube Videos and Nobody Noticed…\nThis weeks' viral video is about viral videos. So meta. YouTuber [Airrack](https://www.youtube.com/@airrack \"open in a new window\") has made a name for himself with challenge and prank videos, often involving sneaking into and hiding in unlikely places, like the [Superbowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8btpqys1Rxk \"open in a new window\") or [Disneyland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnSCCxGqBJw \"open in a new window\"). This week, he decided to sneak into other YouTubers' videos. \nThe idea is that Airrack would disguise himself and appear in the background of videos from online celebrities like cooking YouTuber [Nick Digiovanni](https://www.youtube.com/@NickDiGiovanni \"open in a new window\"), fitness influencer [Jesse James West](https://www.youtube.com/@JesseJamesWest \"open in a new window\"), filmmaker [Darman](https://www.youtube.com/@DharMann \"open in a new window\"), gadget-maker [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober \"open in a new window\"), and car destroyer [Whistlin' Diesel](https://www.youtube.com/@whistlindiesel \"open in a new window\"). If the commenters spot him, they get a point. If they don't, Airrack does. I won't spoil the ending, but Airrack has promised that if he loses, he'll do whatever the most upvoted comment says. That comment is \"Legally change your name to diddy,\" which really raises the stakes. Whether the entire project is a delightful sitcom-crossover-style experiment or an annoying influencer stunt depends on your point of view, but the kids, as they say, love it.",

You may also be able to see [the Beehive Cluster (Messier 44)](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-44/ \"open in a new window\"), a cluster of 1,000 stars that's around 600 light years away, lit up by the glow of the Red Planet. \n## May 5: Eta Aquarid peak\nThe Eta Aquarid meteor shower has been active since mid-April, but it will peak on the night of May 5-6. This event results from the Earth passing through debris left behind by Halley's Comet (which is also responsible for the Orionids in October). The shower is best viewed in the Southern Hemisphere, but in the north, viewers may still see 10-30 meteors per hour. \n[According to Space.com](https://www.space.com/36502-eta-aquarid-meteor-shower-guide.html \"open in a new window\"), the best time to catch the Eta Aquarid peak is between 2 a.m. and dawn local time. As always, you'll want to choose a location that's as dark and free of light pollution as possible, and give your eyes at least 30 minutes to adjust. \n## May 12: Flower Moon\nMay's full moon is known as the Flower Moon, and it will occur on May 12. Like April's Pink Moon, the Flower Moon is a micromoon: 5% smaller and 10% dimmer than a regular full moon because it takes place at the farthest point from Earth. \n## Planetary events in May\n[Planet pairs in May](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-may-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/ \"open in a new window\") include Venus and Saturn, which can be seen close together, low in the eastern sky, early in the morning toward the beginning of the month. In the evening, look west a few hours after sunset to see Mars and Jupiter. \nFor stargazers, the [Corona Borealis](https://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/corona-borealis-constellation/ \"open in a new window\") will be visible all month in the eastern sky during the first half of the night. Dark skies on the night of May 26 (thanks to the new moon) may be especially good for locating constellations. You may also be able to catch two globular clusters--densely packed stars--on May 11 and May 28, when [Messier 5](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-5/ \"open in a new window\") and [Messier 4](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-4/ \"open in a new window\") will be favorably located.",

    "title": "Change These Settings on Your Gaming Laptop to Save Battery and Play Longer",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Gaming laptops are a great blend of portability and power, but you can usually only get one or the other at a time. Plug your laptop in and you can have top-notch graphics, but as soon as you unplug, all those polygons will drain your battery faster than you can say \"Play of the game.\" Fortunately, there are some ways to mitigate this downside.\nThe good news is that gaming laptop manufacturers have invested a good deal of effort into tools that will try to balance GPU performance with battery savings. Your laptop may have even come out of the box configured with some of my suggestions, but this varies widely by manufacturer, so be sure to check yours anyway.\nIt's also important to note that battery life savings will vary widely by what type of game you play. A laptop that can last all day playing _Stardew Valley_ will obviously die much faster while cranking through frames in games like _Overwatch 2_ or _Marvel Rivals_. Which is to say, based on what game your playing, your mileage will vary _a lot_. Experimentation is your friend here. \n## Set battery-specific default options\nWindows can set different power settings when you disconnect your laptop from a power source, and this is where your tweaking should start. Here are just a few things you can adjust to start with:\n  * **Switch your power mode:** In the Windows Settings app, head to System > Power & battery and under \"Power\" you can choose from a few basic power modes. Most laptops default to Balanced, but you can switch to \"Best power efficiency.\" In this mode, Windows will make small changes like turning off the screen sooner or limiting the CPU clock speed to save more power.\n  * **Put your display to sleep faster.** Your laptop's screen is one of the biggest battery drains, and every minute it's on while you're not using it is power wasted. If the default is set to around five minutes or longer, you can save a decent chunk of battery by switching this to one minute.\n  * **Check your manufacturer's software:** Companies like Razer, MSI, and Asus have their own software preloaded on gaming laptops that provide more settings you can fiddle with. Some settings, like switching refresh rate (more on that below) when you're on battery power aren't available in base Windows, so be sure to check what's available.\n\n\nThe more settings you can set to automatically change while on battery, the less you have to fiddle with every time you try to play games on the go. And there are, unfortunately, still quite a few that won't change automatically.\n## Change your display's refresh rate\nOne of the other ways your display drains battery is with its refresh rate. While many games can get by with 60 or even 30 frames per second (FPS), some fast-paced and competitive games can utilize FPS in the multiple hundreds. If you're not playing a game where enemies are rapidly moving around the screen, you can save a _ton_ of power by changing the refresh rate.\nImportantly, \"refresh rate\" is distinct from a game's FPS. Most games have some kind of FPS settings that let you limit how many frames the game generates. This can save battery power because the GPU doesn't have to waste energy rendering frames you don't need. However, without changing your display's refresh rate, the screen itself will still update more times per second than you need.\nSearch for \"Display Settings\" in your Start menu and select \"Advanced display\" towards the bottom. On this screen, you can change the refresh rate for your screen. This is a setting you'll have to change manually every time, so it might be a good idea to see if your manufacturer has a tool to automatically change refresh rate while on battery, first.\n## Turn off the unnecessary lighting--including backlights\nThe primary features that distinguish a gaming laptop are RGB LEDs, a powerful GPU, and high-quality displays, _in that order_. And while your device will cease _spiritually_ being a gaming laptop the moment you turn off all the colorful lights, it will at least save a bit of power.\nRGB LEDs themselves aren't super power-intensive, but most manufacturers include software to choreograph lighting effects and even make your lights responsive to your games. Turning this all off won't magically give you several hours of gameplay, but the power savings aren't negligible.\nYou can also save a little extra power by turning off your keyboard backlight, and more by dimming your display brightness. The latter will depend heavily on what type of display you have. LCD displays have a backlight that shines through color pixels, while OLED-based displays light each pixel individually. In both cases, dimming your display will save a bit of power, but how much will depend on your display.\n## Adjust your game's graphics settings\nYou spent three months' rent on a gaming laptop with an RTX 4090 inside, and I'm about to suggest you play on Medium settings? Who do I think I am? Well, all that power doesn't mean much if your laptop dies 20 minutes after you start. So, if you're not connected to a power source, maybe turn the ray-tracing off.\nIf your games have graphics presets, try starting with the lowest settings and work your way up. Most games that have really power-hungry features like ray-tracing will automatically turn these off at lower presets, so you can get a baseline of how long your battery lasts, then slowly bump the graphics up as needed.\n## Disable all the preloaded junk\nYou bought this laptop for gaming, but it's still a Windows machine. Which means it probably came preloaded with some stuff Microsoft--or the manufacturer--wants included that has nothing to do with gaming. Microsoft Teams, an application that I even found running in the background on [_the ROG Ally_](https://rog.asus.com/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-2023/ \"open in a new window\"), is one example.\nHit Ctrl+Shift+Escape to pull up your task manager on your laptop and take a look at what processes are running in the background. While some might be ambiguous tools your games need (you shouldn't mess with those) you probably don't need Teams or OneDrive running in the background constantly.\nYou can also take a look at any utilities running in the system tray to find bloatware apps you don't need. Typically, gaming laptops mostly come with bundled software that is relevant to gaming, but if there's extra junk, disable it.",

    "title": "What Today's Tariff Changes Mean for Your Online Shopping Habit",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Trump's tariffs mean the days of ultra-cheap online shopping from international retailers are coming to an end. Starting today, the long-standing exemption on import tariffs for packages valued under $800--known as the \"de minimis\" exemption--has been eliminated for shipments from China, a move that will dramatically impact consumers who have grown accustomed to suspiciously cheap e-commerce goods from sites like Shein and Temu.   \n  \nWhile the exemption remains in place for countries other than China, the Trump administration has indicated it plans to eventually eliminate those carve-outs as well. Here's how the end of this tariff loophole will impact you, and what you can do to make the most of it.\n## What's is the de minimis __ exemption, and why is it ending?\nPreviously, packages valued under $800 entered the United States without any import duties or tariffs. This loophole allowed e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, and the TikTok Shop to flood the U.S. market with incredibly low-priced goods shipped directly from overseas manufacturers, bypassing traditional import taxes that domestic retailers face.\nThe Trump administration officially ended this exemption today for packages originating in China, which has thus far [borne the brunt](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/trump-raises-tariffs-on-china-to-125-overview-and-trade-implications/ \"open in a new window\") of the president's restrictive tariff policies. Without the de minimus exemption, even your $15 t-shirt or $5 phone case will now be subject to tariffs when shipped from China.\n## How will this affect your wallet?\nAccording to [Krista Li](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.html?id=KJLI \"open in a new window\") from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, whose research focuses on online shopping behaviors, the impact will be significant: \"The end of the de minimis exemption means that many low-cost goods, such as fast fashion and apparel, small electronics, home kitchen goods, toys, and beauty products, shipped directly to U.S. consumers via postal services, particularly from international e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu, will now be subject to a baseline tariff as high as 145%.\"\nWhat does that mean in practical terms? That $10 blouse from Shein could potentially cost _$24.50_ after tariffs. Those $15 wireless earbuds from Temu might jump to $36.75.\n## Beyond price increases\nThe changes go beyond just higher prices. Li explains that consumers should higher prices, yes--but also fewer ultra-cheap options, potentially fewer varieties, and slower delivery times as manufacturers and retailers adjust to the new cost structure. \"Consumers may make fewer impulse purchases of inexpensive imported goods and be more price-conscious,\" according to Li.\nShipping times may also increase as customs processing becomes more complex. Many international retailers are scrambling to adjust their operations, with some considering opening U.S. warehouses to mitigate the impact--though this would likely still result in higher prices to cover these new expenses.\n## What this means for different online retailers\nThere are a lot of reasons you might want to curb your online shopping habit (the environment, your budget, being buried under mountains of stuff, etc.). But with the closing of the de minimis __ loophole, you'll need to brace yourself for a financial impact.\n### Fast fasion sites (Shein, Temu)\nThese platforms will likely be hit hardest, as their entire business model is built around extremely low prices achieved partly through the de minimis loophole. Expect significant price increases or potential changes to their shipping and fulfillment strategies. (Temu has already announced plans to stop shipping direct to consumers from China, [and will rely instead on \"locally based sellers\" to fulfill orders](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79j2n7d4o \"open in a new window\").)\n### Amazon and major U.S. retailers\nEstablished U.S. retailers may actually benefit from the change, as it levels the playing field against international competitors who previously enjoyed tax advantages. However, many Amazon Marketplace sellers source products from overseas, so certain categories may still see price increases.\nIn response to earlier tariff changes, Amazon [briefly considered displaying tariff costs separately in product pricing](https://lifehacker.com/tech/amazon-plan-to-show-tariff-prices), though they ultimately reversed course; the White House accused the company of a politically motivated \"hostile act\" against the administration.\n### Small businesses\nAmerican small businesses have long complained that the de minimis exemption created an unfair advantage for foreign sellers who could ship goods without tariffs. This change may help domestic sellers compete more effectively, but the main takeaway here is that U.S. consumers will bear the cost. Meanwhile, U.S. based businesses that rely on importing goods from China to resell will have to choose between lowering profit margins, charging higher prices, or sourcing goods U.S. made goods (which simply won't be possible for some sellers, as no U.S. made alternatives exist).\n## How to minimize the impact of tariffs when shopping online\nAs prices rise on international platforms, consider these strategies to avoid taking a tariff-related hit to your wallet:\n  1. **Buy in bulk when possible** : Consolidating purchases may help offset some shipping and processing costs.\n  2. **Look for U.S.-based alternatives** : Many domestic retailers have been forced to become more competitive in recent years. When it comes to Shein and Temu specifically, I recommend turning to secondhand markets like [Depop](https://lifehacker.com/tech/depop-app-review).\n  3. **Check retailer policies** : Some international retailers may absorb a greater portion of the tariff costs than others in a bid to maintain market share.\n  4. **Be strategic about big sales** : Major sale events may offer better value as retailers try to maintain volume despite the new tariffs. Stay on top of [what deals are available](https://lifehacker.com/deals) before you check out.\n\n\n## The bottom line\nWhat's clear is the end of an era for seemingly impossibly cheap goods arriving directly from overseas, at least for the time being. But on the bright side, perhaps this hit to your wallet can be a wake-up call to curb your online shopping addiction. I mean, those impossibly low prices were impossible for a reason--the manufacturers rely on unfair wages, low-quality goods, and cutting corners. Maybe it's time to [bring a little more intention to your shopping habits](https://lifehacker.com/money/curb-spending-and-save-money-with-slow-shopping).\nUnfortunately, it won't end here either. Keep bracing yourself for impact of the ongoing trade war, and be prepared to continue to alter your personal shopping habits. As my [colleagues at Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/trump-de-minimis-exception-online-shopping \"open in a new window\") point out, given the[ tariff-related price increases](https://mashable.com/article/trump-tariff-price-increases-tech \"open in a new window\") we've seen so far, we can expect to see more import taxes passed on to U.S. consumers going forward.",

    "title": "My Six Favorite Apps for Selling Used Clothing and Household Items",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nFor over a year, I have been on a quest to sell a bunch of my stuff to make room in my closet--and, in the process, earn money for more stuff. \nI have encountered highs, lows, and many resale apps, some of which are better than others. In addition to making me a little extra money, this endeavor has really helped me reduce my clutter, too: A lot of [the popular decluttering techniques](https://lifehacker.com/home/best-decluttering-methods) ask you to sort your items into three categories--keep, throw, and donate--but by adding the fourth category of things to sell, I've cleared major space in my closet. What's more, I do my best to use my \"balance\" in each app to buy any new items I want or need, helping me stick to my own version of the \"[one in, one out](https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-use-one-in-one-out-trend-to-declutter-over-time)\" decluttering method. \nAfter all these months and dozens of trips to the post office, here's what I've learned about buying and selling online and which apps I recommend most. \n## A few notes on reselling clothing online\nThere _are_ sellers on these apps who do this in a hardcore way, sourcing cool, rare, or expensive items and turning them for a profit. They treat this like a job and, in some cases, it _is_ their job. You don't have to be like that. Don't worry about the profiles that feature professional-grade photos and hundreds of listings, because someone out there wants the thing you're selling and will find it by searching for it--it won't really matter if you're displaying the item on a mannequin in studio lighting as long as it's the right size and price for the buyer. \nHere are my tips to get you started.\n  1. **Don 't list something unless you'd actually want to get rid of it if it sold**. That seems obvious, but this has happened to me: I'll get a little overzealous, list something I still use, and feel sad when it gets bought sooner than I wanted it to. One safeguard I've employed is listing things I still like to wear at higher prices than they deserve. Interested buyers will still like the listings and may send offers I can consider. If someone actually buys it at the listed price, it was meant to be--and I get extra money to soothe myself through the grief of losing the item.\n  2. **On the other hand, don 't list something if you _really_ want it out of the house**. You can't determine how fast something will sell, even if you undervalue it in price and promote it on the apps every day. If waiting for something to sell impedes your decluttering, consider a brick-and-mortar consignment shop if the item is truly valuable--or just donate it.\n  3. **I still use my items while they 're listed on my apps, but be careful if you choose to do this**. If something happens to a bag, like it gets a scuff or a stain, it reduces its value and you'll have to update the listing at the very least. Don't try to trick people by showcasing something in perfect condition, then sending it to them in worse shape. They can send it back and this can have an impact on your seller rating. \n  4. **Take a lot of pictures**. You don't need fancy lighting or a backdrop, but I at least try to set my wares on a nice rug and keep other stuff out of the frame. Take pictures from a few angles, close-up photos of any damage, and a shot of the date stamp or serial number if it's a luxury or high-end piece. Tags, defining features, and details are important to include. (If you don't do this upfront, be prepared for potential buyers to ask for them later.) \n  5. **Be open to offers and respond to inquiries**. Most of the time, you won't get the price you ask for, at least not in my experience, but accepting reasonable offers or being willing to lower the price will help you get the thing out of your house and the money into your account.\n  6. **Always search for the item you 're selling to see what other people are selling theirs for**. If yours is of comparable quality, consider listing it for a little less than your competitors to get it sold faster.\n  7. **If you list the same thing on multiple apps, stay on top of what you're doing**. A few weeks ago, I sold a wristlet that I accidentally way undervalued on one app a day after listing it for its true value on another. I lost out on good money! Plus, if something sells on one app, you need to immediately remove its listing everywhere else. Otherwise, it could \"sell\" again, you'll need to cancel that order, and your seller rating may take a hit.\n  8. **Finally, and perhaps most importantly, be wary of scams**. This applies more to you if you're buying something than if you're selling, but as a general rule, never communicate with anyone off-app, let alone conduct transactions that way. These apps are reputable and well-run. Anyone claiming they're having trouble with the payment system is almost certainly lying to you. All of the apps I highlight here have quality customer service and are available to help you if you're sold a counterfeit item or encounter a buyer who is lying about the condition of the thing you sold, but you need to conduct your transactions on the app for them to be able to render service. \n\n\n## The first app you need is Vendoo\nBefore I get into my top apps for buying and selling, I want to highlight one that has made my use of all of them much easier: [Vendoo](https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-need-vendoo-if-you-are-trying-to-sell-your-stuff-online). Essentially, it's a cross-listing app that enables you to create listings for all your sellable possessions, then post them to a variety of marketplaces, including Poshmark, Vestiaire Collective, Depop, Mercari, and more. You can change prices, track sales, and stay much more organized if your goal is to get rid of as much as you can as fast as you can. \nHaving your goods for sale across multiple platforms is helpful because, while there are a lot of shoppers who peruse multiple apps, each one also has a pretty dedicated fanbase that _only_ uses one specific marketplace. By cross-listing, you increase your chances of a potential buyer running across your item. \nAnother app that is really helpful is [PrimeLister](https://lifehacker.com/tech/primelister-app-review), but really only if you're selling on Poshmark. This one automates all of the tedious little tasks you can (and should) do to boost your sales, like sharing your listings to landing pages and the homepages of your followers, plus it gives you the option to bulk-complete tasks, like changing prices or sending out discount offers to interested buyers. \nVendoo and PrimeLister both cost money--about $30 per month, depending on the services you need--but, in my experience, are worth it for boosting sales and making this process easy.\n## The best apps to sell clothes and accessories\nEven though I only really got into selling about a year ago, I've been buying on these platforms for many, many years and made the sporadic sale here and there back in the day, too. I recommend Poshmark, Vestiaire Collective, TheRealReal, and Depop. To me, these four have the best interfaces and are easiest to use for buying and selling. Let's go over their details. \n### Poshmark: Best for selling pretty much anything\nWhen you sell on [_Poshmark_](https://zdcs.link/1vXqR?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Poshmark&short_url=1vXqR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), you keep 80% of your sales as long as they're over $15. For anything under $15, you pay the app a fee of $2.95. On this app, buyers can offer lower prices than what you're listing your item for and you're free to accept or decline their offers. \nDeclining gives you the chance to submit a counteroffer, so you may end up negotiating for a little bit, but the app always notifies you of what, exactly, you'll make if you sell something at a certain price. The app also allows potential buyers to \"like\" items, enabling you to send private discount offers to all of a listing's likers at once. Lowering the price of an item is easy, too, and you can share listings to \"parties\" that match your item's description. For instance, Poshmark regularly hosts luxury bag parties, creating a landing page for shoppers looking for those, and I share my listings for bags to those parties when they're happening. \nCreating a listing is very easy if you're doing it in-app, not using a third-party service like Vendoo. Upload your photos, fill out a form that includes simple details like size, brand, original price, and asking price, and you're good to go.\nIf there's a downside to Poshmark, it's that you do need to be pretty active and engaged. Offers expire after 24 hours, you can only share listings to a party when the party is happening, and users expect timely responses to their comments. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\nLike I said, you can put anything on here. You can sell a Louis Vuitton bag or a Nike T-shirt. Some people sell housewares and handicrafts. I've bought a few Diptyque candles and once offloaded a Yankees bobblehead I accidentally acquired on a trip to the Bronx. If you want an app where you can sell _everything_ , not just a certain kind of clothing, it should be Poshmark. \nIn my experience, selling higher-end items on Poshmark is hit or miss. Yes, I've done it, but people on there are shopping for all kinds of things. I mostly buy baseball jerseys there and save my own luxury resale browsing for other apps. Poshmark doesn't authenticate designer goods the way other dedicated luxury apps do, so buyers are less confident _and_ more likely to lowball you to make up for their lack of faith in your wares. If you have mid-tier stuff, like Lululemon, Uggs, or Skims, Poshmark is going to be especially handy for you. \nAll that said, Poshmark is by far my most-used resale app and I'd say I conduct over 90% of my business there. The interface is easy to navigate, the variety of listings and diverse user base lend themselves to a surprisingly high amount of sales on even the most random things, and selling is really easy. When I make a sale, Poshmark generates a QR code that I simply have to show to the people at the post office. The shipping fee is paid by the customer and includes a priority box or envelope. I don't have to print a label, buy a box, or do anything but show up at the post office. A day or two after the buyer gets the item, the money appears in my balance. Crucially, Poshmark allows you to use your sales balance to purchase things on the app, which I really love, but you can also very easily transfer it out into your bank account. [Read my full Poshmark review here](https://lifehacker.com/tech/poshmark-app-review). \n### Vestiaire Collective: Best for higher-end items to maximize profits\n[ _Vestiaire Collective_](https://zdcs.link/6XY8Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vestiaire%20Collective&short_url=6XY8Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is meant for higher-end items, which usually means luxury goods, but I've seen it include plenty of other quality stuff, like Gymshark. Where this one shines is its authentication process. Much of the time, items you sell will be shipped straight to VC, where a staffer will authenticate them and send them out to the buyer. This extra security is great, especially for really high-ticket items, and VC has low selling fees: You pay 10% on every sale, plus a 3% payment processing fee. You don't get charged on your first one, either, as long as it's below $2,000. \nVC often runs specials, too, where where you'll pay no seller's fees on certain brands, for example. Like Poshmark, buyers can send offers, but here, you have two days to accept, decline, or counter them, rather than one. One difference that can throw a bit of a learning curveball is that once you accept an offer, the buyer has to make the purchase. On Poshmark, a buyer who sends an offer agrees that if you accept it, their balance or card is charged. On VC, just because you accept the low price does not mean you've made the sale. The buyer then has two more days to decide if they want to go through with it. Selling on VC, in my experience, is a much slower process than other apps, especially because of the extra time required for in-person authentication. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\nOverall, I love buying on here because I know I'm always getting high-quality goods, but the slow pace of sales stops me from selling on VC too often. When you make a VC sale, you don't get a handy QR code to ship the item. Rather, you have to print the label, buy a box or envelope, and ship it yourself. It takes a while for the money to get to you, given that the item has to go to VC for authentication before being sent out to the buyer. And when you do get that money, it goes into your Venmo account, not a balance that you can use to make new purchases. \nIt's worth noting that VC is the most global app on my list. People around the world buy and sell on here, which is awesome because it really broadens the market from which you can purchase and the population to which you can sell, but not-so-awesome because global shipping certainly takes a while. If you buy, don't expect your item to come in quickly--and if you sell, don't expect your money to come in quickly.\nBuyers on here are looking to spend on nice stuff, so you won't get lowballed often and items that wouldn't sell on a more mid-level app get way more attention. Selling on VC requires you to measure your bags, take more specific photos of items (including ones that clearly show brand labeling), identify the material your item is made of, and wait--sometimes, in my experience, up to two or three days--for the photos to be approved by a staffer. Like I said, this is not a fast-money app, but one nice thing is that the app suggests a price for your listing based on prices similar items in similar condition have sold at, so you don't have to guess. For all the extra work you need to do on this one, it does help you out with little features like that--plus, its cut of the profit is lower than competitors', so if you're willing to put in more effort and wait a little longer, you do end up making more money.

How much you actually make depends on your \"loyalty tier\" at the time of sale, so if you're just starting out, you get 55% commission on anything sold for more than $195. If you earn $1,500 in annual net sales, you move up to a new tier and earn more. You can also just fork your goods over to TRR in exchange for site credit and let them sell as they will. I won't lie: It's a little confusing, so only go with this one if you have really expensive items to sell that require authentication and can still bring in a hefty chunk of cash, even with fees. \nI use this app almost exclusively as a buyer, not a seller. Since TRR is in charge of the prices, a lot of really nice things inevitably go on a deep discount if they don't get sold quickly. If you want a quality piece that you can wear for a little and then resell, try looking here. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\n### Depop: Best for getting rid of anything you have, from mall finds to more luxe items\n[Depop](https://zdcs.link/2emmE?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Depop&short_url=2emmE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") is another site where you can sell _anything_. It can be fancy, it can be basic, it can be handmade--you can sell whatever. You don't pay a listing fee, but you pay a 10% fee for everything you sell. That's it. It's super straightforward, and Depop helps you fill out the listing by populating suggestions based on your pictures and text inputs. This speeds up the process so you're not spending five minutes on every listing, pulling brand names and sizes from drop-down menus. You can offer likers discounts and, like Poshmark and VC, field offers from potential buyers. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\nI've had success with Depop as a seller and a buyer, but it's definitely a crowded marketplace. I think of it more like a thrift store than anything. You can find fancy things, yes, but they're not authenticated and I've seen pages and pages of very obvious fakes (and, likely, _less_ obvious fakes I didn't bother investigating), so beware. (As a side note, if you ever need help determining if a listed luxury product is authentic, you can reach out to me. This is a fun hobby I genuinely enjoy.) \nAlso prominent are truly basic things, like Forever 21 tops. You may not think the fast-fashion, mall-bought shirts clogging up your closet are worth trying to sell, but you'd be very surprised. Someone out there may want them, so try listing them on Depop before donating or tossing them. Set a hard deadline for yourself, though. If it doesn't sell in, say, two weeks, get rid of it another way. Again, selling is awesome, but not if it stops you from effectively decluttering. [Read my full Depop review here](https://lifehacker.com/tech/depop-app-review). \n## Best for set-it-and-forget it sales: Mercari\nI am very new to [Mercari](https://zdcs.link/91jJ2x?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mercari&short_url=91jJ2x&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\"), as it's the only app on this list I downloaded just to review and had never used before. That said, I liked what I saw! The process of listing on Mercari is especially simple, so this is a solid entry point if you're new to reselling and want to start with a more manageable experience. Tapping **Sell** at the bottom of the home screen brings you to a listing creation page that is notably pared down when compared to the other apps on this list. You add your photos, a title, a longer description, up to seven hashtags, a category, a brand, and a condition indicator. You have the opportunity to offer free shipping (which means you pay for it) or make the buyer pay the cost. Then, you set your listing price. That's it.\nRemarkably, Mercari will even handle your discounting for you, which is something you have to do manually on the other apps or else recruit a third-party service like PoshLister to manage for you. When you finish creating a listing, just toggle on \"Smart Pricing,\" set a minimum you'd be willing to accept for the product, and do nothing else. Over time, if it doesn't sell, Mercari will incrementally lower the price until it hits that minimum you set. Of all the apps here, this one is the most hands-off from beginning to end. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\nThere is one downside: While all apps take a little cut of your profit in the form of seller's fees, not every app charges _buyer's_ fees, however, which Mercari does as of January 2025: Buyers pay a \"Buyer Protection Fee\" of 3.6% on Mercari, and that fee is displayed as part of the final price in the item checkout section. Think of it like when you order food off Uber Eats, but only see the _true_ cost, with fees, when you get to the very end.\nIf you're a seller, you might want to keep that in mind and, unfortunately, lower some of your prices to make your wares more appealing in light of these price increases. You also need to keep in mind the fees you'll pay on the sale. Mercari takes a 10% cut of your earnings and, depending on whether you elected to offer \"free shipping\" to buyers, you'll could also have to pay around $9 for the shipping cost. Some good news is that you can spend your balance in-app, which you know I'm a big fan of.

I've only been using it for two months and few bags in my closet have already been rented multiple times. Theoretically, they can keep generating me money over and over again _and_ I can keep using them myself, neither of which is true when you make a straight-up sale. \nThere are three ways you can rent out your stuff on Pickle: You can arrange a meetup with a renter and hand it off in person, the renter can pay a $3 fee for a courier to transport your item to and from their location, or you can ship your goods wherever the other person is in the country. Meetups really only work in large metro areas, but with the shipping option--and because the courier system runs through established apps like Uber Eats and Doordash--Pickle works surprisingly well even in far-flung areas. During a recent interview, the app's cofounder also let me know that it's hoping to broaden the scope of Pickle's marketplace offerings soon, too, so you could rent out musical instruments, camera equipment, or whatever goods you have lying around. \nCredit: Lindsey Ellefson\nI have loved being able to put my goods to work and a few of my handbags and shoes are close to paying themselves off, so to speak. Like other apps, Pickle allows potential renters to send you an offer, which you can accept or decline, and it takes a 20% fee off your profit, but again, you get your stuff back and can rent it out again indefinitely. If you're worried about sending your possessions out, take heart knowing Pickle has a robust customer service team and care policy. If someone damages or fails to return your item, the Pickle team works with you to get you the value of the goods. That's a rarity, though, because the app has a strong community feel to it. Not only have my things always been returned in perfect condition, but they usually come with thank-you notes and, notably, one renter even sent me a thank-you _gift_. \nPickle is really helpful if you're starting to declutter because it is comparable to a [purgatory box](https://lifehacker.com/designate-purgatory-box-for-decluttering), or a space you put something if you're not quite sure you're ready to get rid of it. You can experience what life is like without immediate access to that item and you may even find you didn't miss it. In that case, list it on one of the apps above. Notably, Pickle also allows you to sell your stuff. All you have to do is indicate an item is for sale in its rental listing.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "You probably know you don't have to pay to use Spotify, as long as you're good with ads. For a commercial-free experience, of course, you need to subscribe to Premium. If you ever tried to sign up for Spotify Premium on your iPhone, however, you might have noticed there was no way to do so--neither a \"pay now\" button, nor a link to subscribe elsewhere.\n## The Apple tax\nThat's because Spotify didn't want [15-30% of the money you gave it going directly to Apple](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/01/08/the-cost-of-doing-business-apples-app-store-fees-explained \"open in a new window\"). That's how Apple's App Store works (and largely Google's, for that matter). Any payments you make within an app on your iPhone, Apple gets a cut--either 15% or 30%, depending on how much money the app in question has paid, or how long a subscription has been running for.\nSpotify and apps like it don't have to pay the Apple tax if you make your purchases outside the app: Signing up for Spotify Premium through Safari, for example, means Spotify gets 100% of the money. Apple knows this, which is why it has traditionally banned apps from linking to external sites for payments. In their view, if you want customers to pay for your services directly, you either need to go through the app and pay the fee, or hope they google it on their own.\nSpotify had a Premium tab in the app, even for free users, but it only let those users know those subscriptions existed, and that they needed to subscribe through their web browser if they wanted to sign up. (The app even acknowledged that it was a pain, without _directly_ blaming Apple.)\n## Spotify can now direct you to its own website for payments\n[That all changed this week](https://lifehacker.com/tech/fortnite-app-store-ruling): Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple cannot block developers in any way from directing their users to third-party websites to make payments, or to impose any fees on purchases made outside the app. That means that apps like Spotify can push updates to their app, which include links to their own websites for payments and subscriptions.\nApple says it will comply with the ruling, but appeal it all the same. In the interim, however, it does appear the company is in compliance, as Apple did approve Spotify's latest update. If you go to the Premium tab in the app, you now see links to various subscription options. \nThis ruling didn't come out of nowhere. It's in response to [_Fortnite_ developer Epic Games' continuous antitrust lawsuit against Apple](https://lifehacker.com/tech/fortnite-app-store-ruling). Judge Rogers disagreed with most of Epic's claims in a 2021 decision, but did rule that Apple needed to allow developers to direct customers to third-party payment options. Apple bent the rules here, by issuing a new fee on purchases made outside of apps, as well as rolling out messages to persuade customers away from these third-party sites. Judge Rogers was not pleased, calling out Apple executives (including CEO Tim Cook), and holding the company in civil contempt of court. Apple may also be investigated for criminal contempt. \nApple might have had a particularly bad day in court, but apps like Spotify are likely quite pleased. So, expect to see more options to pay for things outside of the apps you use. Some might even charge less, now that it's easier to direct customers away from Apple's in-app purchases. Not Spotify, though: The company didn't offer in-app payments before, and still don't, so Premium still costs exactly the same.",

    "title": "I Can't Stop Making This Brazilian Cheesy Bread",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Cheese and carbs have never been a tough sell, but if you've ever had a stretchy, springy bite of pao de queijo (a Brazilian cheese bread puff) then you know that this simple combination can soar to new heights. It's the most utterly stretchy cheese puff you've ever known. If you _haven 't_ had the pleasure of noshing on pao de queijo, then we should change that. Luckily, it only requires six ingredients and with the help of a blender or stand mixer, it's nearly effortless. \n## What is pao de queijo?\nWhile many South American countries have a version of a this cheesy bread, [_p ao de queijo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A3o_de_queijo \"open in a new window\") originated in Brazil. This delightful snack owes its stretchy, gummy center to tapioca flour, a starch made from the cassava root. Cheese delivers its own stretch too, but I find it plays a bigger role as the primary flavoring ingredient. So using a powerful cheese with plenty of flavor pays off in the end. Add a bit of egg, oil, and milk and you're on your way.\nI first had pao de queijo in a Brazilian restaurant in Brooklyn, where the we were quickly supplied with a basket of golden brown flecked pastry balls about the size of a large egg. My friend stopped the conversation and directed my attention to the bread because this was the whole reason she brought me there. After tearing one in half--which took a long moment, due to the never-ending cheesy stretch--I understood why we had paused our discussion. This chewy, salty, crusty but soft pao de queijo demands your full attention, and deserves it. \nA few years later, I did have the distinct pleasure of eating pao de queijo in Brazil. It's not uncommon to have them with breakfast, or for a cafe to serve a few golden spheres alongside your coffee. The ones I ate in Brazil are made in frustratingly small sizes compared to how big my appetite is for them, but not everyone is a cheese monster like I am. And in my own home, I get to make them bigger. \nThere are two different methods that I've used for making pao de queijo: a blender version and a stand mixer version. (If you haven't joined the stand mixer club yet, here's what to look for when you're [shopping for one.](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/what-to-consider-when-buying-stand-mixer)) Both recipes are delicious, so instead of choosing for you, I've provided them both.  \n## Pao de queijo in your blender\nThis style of pao de queijo is more like a batter. It's extremely simple: I just add all of the ingredients to my Vitamix, but you can use any other blender just as well. (If you need a fancy new blender, [this one](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-ascent-x5-blender-review) has nearly changed my life.) The oven takes care of the rest. It's better to use a cupcake pan (or a mini cupcake pan) to shape the puffs. I used this recipe from the back of the Bob's Red Mill Tapioca Flour package. I took the liberty of adding extra cheese before baking and included that here.\nIngredients:\n  * 1 egg\n  * ¼ cup olive oil \n  * ⅔ cup milk\n  * 1 ½ cups tapioca flour\n  * ½ cup grated cheddar cheese, plus extra for topping\n  * ½ teaspoon salt\n\n\n### 1. Blender dump\nButter a cupcake pan, or mini cupcake pan, and preheat the oven to 400ºF. Add all of the ingredients to a blender. Blend on low speed to \"catch\" all of the ingredients and slowly increase the speed. Stop the blender and scrape the sides if you see any tapioca flour is stuck. Blend again if necessary.\n### 2. Bake\nPour the contents of the blender into the greased cups of a cupcake pan, or mini cupcake pan. I only fill them about halfway to three quarters full. Then top them each with a pinch of extra cheese. Bake them for about 20 minutes, or until puffed and the cheese has browned.\n## Pao de queijo in your stand mixer\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nI used this [_recipe from TudoGostoso_](https://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/69468-pao-de-queijo-facil-e-delicioso.html \"open in a new window\") which ends up with more of a dough consistency partially due to heating the tapioca with hot milk and oil before it goes in the oven. \nIngredients:\n  * 500 grams tapioca flour (I used the whole bag of Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour)\n  * 1 tablespoon salt\n  * 250 mL milk (slightly more than 1 cup)\n  * 1 to 2 eggs (the second egg is only if needed)\n  * 12 ounce shredded cheese (I used a mozzarella, parmesan, and cheddar blend)\n\n\n### 1. Dry and wet ingredients \nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Add the tapioca flour and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer. In a pan or pot, add the milk and oil. Heat the liquid mixture over medium until it starts to bubble on the edges. \n### 2. Mix the dough\nAdd a paddle attachment and turn the mixer on the lowest speed. Pour in the hot oil and milk mixture all at once with the mixer running. Mix until evenly incorporated and the texture is consistent and sandy. Add one egg and the cheese. If the dough is dry, add the other egg. It should feel like soft cookie dough. Mix until the dough is homogeneous and thick. \n### 3. Form the balls\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nShape the dough into 1-inch balls. I scooped the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and then rolled them in my palms to smooth out the shape. Give them an inch of space between each ball and bake them in a 350ºF oven until fully puffed and lightly browned on the bottom, about 20 to 25 minutes. Enjoy warm.",

    "title": "Five Unusual, Fun Careers That Actually Pay Pretty Well",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Only 50% of employed people in the U.S. describe themselves as \"[extremely satisfied](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/12/10/most-americans-feel-good-about-their-job-security-but-not-their-pay/ \"open in a new window\")\" with their job, so it's safe to say that everyone at some point in their lives has [dreaded going to work on Monday](https://lifehacker.com/what-are-the-sunday-scaries-and-how-can-you-beat-them-1848432035) and dreamed of the sort of career you see on television: Fun, exciting, and with a high enough salary to be comfortable.\nIf you think that \"fun\" and \"pays enough\" are polar opposites, the good news is that's not true. If you want to have a good time while earning a salary, there are some surprising options out there. These jobs [may not make you rich](https://lifehacker.com/work/high-paying-jobs-most-people-dont-want), but they will pay your bills while you get to have a blast.\n## LEGO master builder\nIf you thought your days of playing with LEGO ended when you became an adult, it's time to revise your concept of adulthood because the LEGO master builder profession exists. This--and I cannot stress this enough--is a real job. LEGO hires people at its stores and facilities to build, maintain, and repair massive, complex installations. Master builders also perform a PR role for the company, doing interviews and creating social media content.\nGetting the job doesn't require any formal education or certification--a high school diploma is the basic requirement--but a background in art and design won't hurt. The main qualification is creativity, so having a portfolio of impressive LEGO creations is essential. The company holds regional competitions called Brick Factors where you compete against other LEGO enthusiasts to be named an assistant master builder, putting you on the career track of your childhood dreams, so you'll have to check at your local [Discovery Center](https://www.legolanddiscoverycenter.com/ \"open in a new window\") for the next opportunity.\nA LEGO master builder earns an average of [about $46,000](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/What-Is-the-Average-Professional-LEGO-Builder-Salary-by-State \"open in a new window\"), with New York being the highest-paying area at about $50,000 annually.\n## Roadie\nThe role of the roadie has evolved quite a bit from the classic image of the grungy dude hauling amplifiers around backstage. Bands and other traveling music performances still need roadies, but the modern incarnations are more specialized, including lighting and sound engineers and instrument technicians. While that might sound intimidating, most roadies learn their skills on the job--they start off with a low-level job at a local music venue, network with artists and managers who come through the space, and often have to work for free for a while in order to establish themselves.\nOnce you do that, however, you can earn anywhere from [$45,000 to $60,000](https://www.careersinmusic.com/roadie/ \"open in a new window\") a year--although it's all freelance work, so your income will vary tremendously depending on whether you're touring with a national act or a band that's just getting started. It can be hard work--long hours and months spent on the road in uncomfortable accommodations--but if you love music and want the rush of setting up a concert for thousands of people, this career could be a blast.\n## Water slide tester\nYes, this is an actual job you can get. Also called a ride verification technician, a water slide tester is exactly what it sounds like: You test water slides for safety, operation, and any other issues. Some of these jobs are permanent in a specific amusement park, and sometimes they travel around the country testing and inspecting slides everywhere, but it still equates to slapping on some swimwear and taking multiple splashdowns every day for a living.\nThe main prerequisite is first aid and lifeguard certifications, which can often be obtained from the hiring company itself. You'll also need to become very familiar with the specifications and operating guidelines for the specific slides, as manufacturers have very strict rules on how frequently people can enter and other stats.\nThe average annual salary for a water slide tester is [about $60,000](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Water-Slide-Tester-Salary \"open in a new window\") annually, although a few years ago someone on Reddit claimed to be making [closer to $100,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/bckxmr/im_a_professional_waterslide_tester_ride/ \"open in a new window\").\n## Ice sculpting\nIf you've ever been to a fancy party (or a party that wants desperately to be fancy), you've probably seen an ice sculpture or two in your time. If you have an artistic mind and a related skill in carving, this could be a fun career that lets you make money by being creative (and bringing a little joy to people, too).\nThere are different routes into the career: You can take a class from someplace like the [Academy of Ice Carving and Design](http://www.academyoficecarving.com/registration.php \"open in a new window\") in Tennessee or from [established ice sculptors](https://briceicesculptures.com/classes \"open in a new window\") who offer them, or you can contact local sculptors and see if you can get a job or an unpaid internship with them. There's no certification process, however, so you can also just start carving some ice and then enter an ice sculpting competition like [Ice Alaska](https://icealaska.com/ \"open in a new window\") or the [Quebec Winter Carnival](https://carnaval.qc.ca/en \"open in a new window\"). A few awards will be all you need to start getting gigs.\nYou can make an average of [about $50,000 annually](https://www.comparably.com/salaries/salaries-for-ice-sculptor \"open in a new window\") as an ice sculptor in the U.S.--but income can be as much as twice as high depending on your location and the opportunities available.\n## Candle or perfume 'nose'\nIf your idea of a good time is being paid to smell things, being a nose is the ideal career. A nose is a professional who works for a perfumery, a candle company, or any other place where smell is a key component of the business.\nBecoming a nose (sometimes called a perfumer, especially in the fragrance business) isn't something you just decide to do, however. While you don't need to be born with a freakish sense of smell, you do need a lot of training. It starts with getting a degree in a field like chemistry or cosmetic science in order to have the fundamental training necessary. From there it's possible to find apprenticeship positions in fragrance houses or at candle companies, but your best bet will likely be certification at a perfumery school, which will take years and won't be cheap. But if your passions run through your sense of smell, this could be the perfect career for you.\nAnd it'll pay your rent, too, depending on where you live: A nose can make [about $70,000](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Perfumer-Salary \"open in a new window\") a year on average.",

[MiNi PhotoEditor](https://mini2-photo-editor.netlify.app/ \"open in a new window\") is a free and open source web application that lets you do basic image editing tasks in your browser, without having to upload your photos to a server somewhere. The application offers quick tools for cropping, lighting, and other adjustments, alongside Instagram-style filters. This is perfect if you ever need to quickly edit an image on a computer where you can't install photo editing software, such as a Chromebook or a work computer.\nTo get started, simply open [the MiNi PhotoEditor website](https://mini2-photo-editor.netlify.app/ \"open in a new window\") and drag an image onto it. In my tests, all images--even large ones--opened instantly, which makes sense, given that all editing happens locally on your computer. No need to wait for it to upload.\nThe editing interface is simple--your image is on the left, and the editing tools are arranged in boxes to the right (or below, if your window isn't wide enough to display them to the side). The top box allows you to rotate the image, crop it (by hand or to a given ratio) and even do some basic perspective shifting. Below that are boxes for adjusting the lighting levels and the color balance, which can be useful if the lighting wasn't quite right when you took the photo. There are also a few Instagram-style filters that can be applied with a click. \nCredit: Justin Pot\nFeel free to make as many edits as you want--the original file isn't affected. You can click the **Split** button in the top-right corner to see the difference between the original image and the edited version. When you're done, click the **Download** button to save the image as either a JPEG or PNG file.\nMiNi PhotoEditor is never going to replace a full-blown photo editor like Photoshop, granted, but it's completely free, it gives you a lot of the basics, and it's available on any device with a web browser.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "If you're a Switch fan, you might know that Nintendo [dropped a pretty significant update this week](https://lifehacker.com/tech/heres-whats-new-in-the-latest-nintendo-switch-update). Version 20.0.0 introduced a number of new features and changes for Nintendo's consoles, including [virtual game cards](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-play-original-switch-games-on-switch-2#:~:text=virtual%20game%20cards) and GameShare, and set the stage for the launch of the Switch 2. However, the update brought with it something Nintendo did _not_ intend: instability. \nIt turns out that after updating to version 20.0.0, some Switch users ran into error codes when booting up their consoles--specifically, Error Code: 2206-1015, which [caused some Switches to crash](https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-update-crashing-issues/ \"open in a new window\"). While it doesn't appear to be affecting most Switches, the problem was bad enough for Nintendo to acknowledge [it via their customer support page on X](https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707 \"open in a new window\"). In the post, the company apologizes for the issue, and reports they are looking into the problem.\n> [ This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. ](https://twitter.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707 \"open in a new window\")\nIt didn't take long for them to find a solution: Nintendo acknowledged the issue on Thursday, May 1, before rolling out a new update on Friday, May 2. According to [the release notes](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current \"open in a new window\"), this update, version 20.0.1, fixes one problem: the issue with Error Code: 2206-1015. If you're installing this update, don't expect to see anything new from version 20.0.0--minus, of course, any error codes.\n## How to update your Switch if it is unresponsive\nThe issue, however, is if you have an affected Switch, you might not be able to update it normally. (That's the tricky thing about bugs that cause your system to crash.) Luckily, Nintendo has a solution: [update your Switch in Maintenance Mode](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28135 \"open in a new window\").\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n  1. Make sure the Switch is totally powered off by pressing down on the power button for 12 seconds.\n  2. Hold the volume up and volume down buttons, then press the power button to turn the system on. \n  3. Do not let go of the volume buttons until your see the Maintenance Mode menu. \n  4. Once you see the Maintenance Mode menu, choose **Update System** , then follow the on-screen instructions to update.",

Tap the Plus button to start a new chat, search for this number, and tap the Chat button next to Perplexity to get started.\nPerplexity's WhatsApp replies are quite fast, but they are short and to the point.

Perplexity's AI is quite fast, coming back with responses in just a couple of seconds. And it supports voice notes too, so you can record a voice note as a question, it will transcribe it, and then promptly get back to you.\nYou can even ask it to generate images, or to edit an image. Perplexity is really trying to make the whole \"make this person bald\" thing happen.\n> [ This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. ](https://twitter.com/greg16676935420/status/1916899521805549811 \"open in a new window\")\nA nice touch here is that Perplexity includes links and sources in its responses, and shares generated images directly in the chat, making them easy to save and forward (ChatGPT, for some weird reason, shares a link to the image instead).\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nPerplexity can also accept forwarded messages as input, so you can use Perplexity AI to fact-check that weird forward from your uncle that you already know is a scam.\n## How Perplexity's WhatsApp integration compares with ChatGPT's\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\n[ChatGPT is also available on WhatsApp](https://lifehacker.com/tech/text-chatgpt-photos-through-whatsapp), for free, and just like Perplexity, it uses the latest available models and is connected to the web. Unlike Perplexity, though, it has an [option to link your phone number](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10193193-1-800-chatgpt-calling-and-messaging-chatgpt-with-your-phone \"open in a new window\") to your account, so all your chats from WhatsApp can show up in your ChatGPT app as well (something Perplexity doesn't offer). Its responses can also be a bit more detailed than Perplexity's, in my experience, including tables and other added context. Still, it's a shame that you have to click a link to see your images.\n## Good for quick questions\nIn my testing, I found Perplexity's WhatsApp bot to be best at short queries. As it stands right now, Perplexity AI's responses on WhatsApp are limited to just a couple of sentences, even if you ask a detailed question, so if you want anything deeper, it's best to switch to the Perplexity app or try texting ChatGPT instead.\nAlthough, these might just be growing pains for Perplexity, which had to take its WhatApp bot down for a couple of hours around launch thanks to [unexpected demand](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1918097013410828568 \"open in a new window\").",

    "title": "How to Choose Between ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity's Deep Research Tools",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "You might be used to AI chatbots answering your questions with a few sentences or even paragraphs, but how about multipage reports? With Deep Research, that's exactly what the likes of [ChatGPT](https://lifehacker.com/tech/chatgpt-finally-has-free-but-limited-deep-research-tool), [Gemini](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-has-dropped-the-paywall-for-these-gemini-features), and [Perplexity](https://lifehacker.com/tech/perplexity-ai-deep-research-almost-as-good-as-openai-and-free) are doing, utilizing their large language models alongside web searches and reasoning capabilities to become research assistants of sorts.\nA Deep Research query takes time (anything between five minutes to 30 minutes, depending on what you ask), but comes back to you with a detailed report on any subject you can ask about, including complex things like niche market research or scientific mysteries. Even better, all three major Deep Research AI providers now have free tiers.\nThough, let's be honest, most of us aren't performing scientific research on a day to day basis. So, how can these Deep Research tools help you? \n## How Deep Research works\nDeep Research combines the power of the open web, large language models, and new reasoning models. When you type in your prompt, it will first use a reasoning model to figure out what you're really asking. At this point, the AI chatbot might even come back to you with clarifying questions and prepare a research plan all on its own. You are free to reply with answers and edit the research plan, but this is usually optional.\nOnce the research begins, you can follow along with what the AI is up to using a sidebar (or separate tab, if you're using Perplexity). Here, you can see the searches the AI is making, documents it's scanning, and information it's collating.\nAs I mentioned above, detailed reports take up to 30 minutes, but that's only true if you're asking something really complicated. In my testing, I found that all three tools generate results in 5-10 minutes, spinning out reports that are still detailed and a couple of pages long.\n## When should you use Deep Research?\nThe best way to use Deep Research tools is when you can't find something on Google yourself, or you don't want to spend the time going through five different articles to distill the basics about a topic.\nI've personally used these Deep Research tools to find a spare part code for my car that Google just wouldn't tell me. I've also used them to research a company's share price outlook, and to learn new things about the handpan, a musical instrument I can't stop obsessing over.\nIf you want quick answers, a regular Search in a AI chatbot is, of course, going to be better. And if you're working on a client pitch and you need a market research for five different competitors, you might want to spring for the paid version of whatever Deep Research tool you're using. But for anything in between, it's worth knowing how to use their lightweight alternatives.\n## How to use Deep Research tools in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity\nAll three competing major AI chatbots have their own Deep Research tools that work in roughly the same fashion. I'll go into detail below, but in general, you start with a prompt, as detailed as you can make it, click the Deep Research button below the prompt, and then send out your query. You can also upload documents, spreadsheets, and images as added context.\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\n## The limits of free Deep Research\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nThe free versions of Deep Research tools are limited. Perplexity and Gemini provide the same quality of Deep Research reports to free users as they do paid plans, but they limit the usage. Perplexity is the most generous, though, with a daily limit system. Perplexity doesn't specify its limits exactly, but it will show you how many Deep Research queries you have left in a day. In my testing, I've been able to make three Deep Research queries per day. You can upgrade to the $20 per month plan to remove all limits.\nGemini limits free users to 5 searches a month, and Gemini Advanced users can generate up to 20 reports a month on the $20 per month plan.\nChatGPT has the most complex structure. Free users get access to five monthly searches using ChatGPT's lightweight model, which doesn't generate full-length reports. Still, in my experience, this free model is enough for regular day-to-day searches. \nChatGPT's $20/month Plus plan increases the limits to 10 queries a month using the full-fledged Deep Research model and 15 using the lightweight one.\n## How I tested ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity's Deep Research tools\nI tested the Deep Research features on all three platforms using the same three prompts. The first was to create a beginner-friendly guide on learning the handpan, the second was to research a company's stock outlook in the market, and the third was to find a part number for a spare wheel screw cover for my car. The last one was something that I just couldn't figure out myself using Google.\n## ChatGPT Deep Research: To the point and robust\nI found ChatGPT's Deep Research to be the most direct and robust. The reports that ChatGPT generates are easy to read, and importantly, contain the information you asked for and nothing else. ChatGPT always asks follow up questions whenever you make a Deep Research query. This can feel tiresome (it did for me), but it clearly works, and you can tell ChatGPT to proceed without follow up answers from you, if you want. \nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nI saw this in both the report for the handpan and the stock research. However, ChatGPT is perhaps not the best at finding shopping links yet. While it did find me the right car part and highlighted it right at the top, it failed to find a link for buying the part in India, where I'm based (but it did find sellers in the US and Europe).\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\n## Gemini Deep Research: Contextual, but wordy\nWhen it comes to Deep Research, Gemini has two strengths: The ability to edit planned research, and access to other Google products.\nWhen you give Gemini a Deep Research prompt, it first goes out and creates a research plan. It will then show you a glimpse of this plan, and you can then edit it if you need to (just approve it if you don't need to make any edits). Unlike ChatGPT, Gemini doesn't ask you clarifying questions, instead focusing on using its integrations with your Google account for wide-level thinking. This being Google, it will include researching relevant information from around your hometown, for instance.\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nGemini's Deep Research feature integrates with Google Search, too. Basically, when you use Deep Research, you're essentially asking the AI to perform multiple Google Searches for you. It can even take into account your browsing history ([though, only if you want it to](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-gemini-search-history-personalization)).\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nBut Gemini's downside is that it's a bit too wordy, and its default research plan is often too broad in scope. It might be best to edit a research plan to make it more specific. I saw this in my test about finding a a number for my car part, where it spent multiple paragraphs talking about spare wheel covers instead of directly pointing out the part number I asked for (something that both ChatGPT and Perplexity do better). The upside is that Gemini integrates Deep Research directly into its Audio Overviews feature, though, so you can easily [generate a short podcast episode](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-generate-podcast-style-audio-overviews-in-gemini-ai) based on your report.\n## Perplexity: Fast and made for web search\n[Perplexity's Deep Research tool](https://lifehacker.com/tech/perplexity-ai-deep-research-almost-as-good-as-openai-and-free) is fast. It's the fastest at coming back with a Deep Research report, sometimes giving me answers in just two minutes or so. It does quite well with shopping links, and shopping research. And it's a one-click affair. Perplexity doesn't ask any follow up questions, nor does it ask you to approve its research plan like Gemini does. It just goes and does its thing.\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nCurrently, Perplexity is adept at integrating web searches into its research, perhaps even better than Gemini is. But its speed comes at a cost. In my testing, I found Perplexity's Deep Research reports to be lacking in detail, even though there were a lot of sources attached to the report.\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\n## Which Deep Research tool is right for you?\nAll three free Deep Research tools have their uses, but some are better suited to certain tasks than others. Based on my research and testing, this is what I've found:\n  * **ChatGPT's Deep Research** documents are the most robust while staying concise, although they suffer a bit when it comes to finding specific links online.\n  * **Gemini's Deep Research** reports are the most detail-oriented, although they tend to be too verbose, and sometimes unnecessarily long.\n  * **Perplexity's Deep Research** tool is the fastest, giving me results in mere minutes. While the research it generates is not often factually wrong, it is lacking in detail or depth when compared to ChatGPT or Gemini.",

The 1.7GHz processor and 2GB of RAM keep things moving smoothly, even when juggling heavy apps like Netflix and Prime Video. There's Wi-Fi 6 support, too, which will benefit crowded households where every device is fighting for bandwidth. Granted, you need a Wi-Fi 6 router to actually see the benefits, but if your setup supports it, this stick delivers. Xbox Game Pass streaming also works here, which is impressive for something that looks like a chunky USB stick, and it supports Bluetooth headphones and gamepads, so you can sneak in some late-night gaming without waking the house.\nAs for the interface, it's unmistakably Amazon-first. Prime Video content is front and center, but nearly every major streaming app--Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, YouTube, Apple TV, Tubi, and more--is here and runs well.

Voice search via the Alexa button feels smarter this time, even letting you search by quotes or scene types, like \"action movies with car chases,\" which is genuinely useful when your brain blanks on titles.

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Scams often fit with the old adage: \"if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\" The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the FBI are warning consumers about several similar-sounding scams that involve the promise of discounted services--ranging from utilities to health insurance--that end with fraudsters stealing your money and you having nothing to show for it. \nHere's how scammers are ripping people off, and how to protect yourself. \n## How discounted services scams work\nOne iteration of this scam type begins with a robocall from someone who claims to be from a utility company (like AT&T or Comcast Xfinity) that offers phone, TV, or internet services. As [the FTC alert describes](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/04/discounted-phone-tv-or-internet-services-if-you-pay-gift-card-no-its-scam \"open in a new window\"), the scammer promises a 40 to 50% discount on future bills, bundles, or product purchases, but only if you act fast and pay up front. They'll ask you to purchase a gift card and provide them with the number--and they may also request your utility account information. \nA [public service announcement](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250430 \"open in a new window\") from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center describes a similar scam involving discount medical insurance. In this scheme, fraudsters reach out via unsolicited calls, texts, or emails and pretend to represent legitimate health insurance providers. They may pressure targets to sign up for a new plan at a discounted rate that's available only for a limited time or promise free services. Once victims purchase a plan, they are unable to cancel it, receive refunds, or use the supposed benefits upon receiving costly medical or dental bills they believed were covered. \n## How to protect yourself\nAs with many scams, there are a few telltale signs that the promise of discounted services is fake, including a stranger contacting you out of the blue trying to sell you something, the sense of urgency to act now or lose the opportunity, and the demand to pay right away (especially with a gift card). \nTo avoid becoming a victim, don't make any quick decisions. End the conversation, and contact the company that's supposedly offering the deal to confirm whether it's real. Only use phone numbers and websites you search for directly--do not click links or call back numbers you're sent in messages. Never pay anything up front. \nIf you are targeted for discounted medical insurance, research the company through your state insurance commissioner and the Better Business Bureau to check whether it's reputable and licensed in your state. Confirm that your providers accept the plan, and read any policy documents carefully before signing. If you don't receive any documents, it's almost certainly a fraud.",

But to research both this article and my updated review, I've been wearing the Whoop for about the last six weeks, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. \nSo here's a deeper dive into what it's actually _like_ to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance. \n## A typical day with Whoop\nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nLet me take you through a typical day. I'm wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it's probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it's still \"processing\" my sleep, and there's a button I can press to \"end sleep\" and get my recovery results. \nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your \"journal\" the first time you open the app each day. I'll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let's say you've already filled out your journal, and you're looking at the main app. From the home screen, I can see: \n  * **My recovery at the top** , color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.) \n  * **Some notes about things I should pay attention to**. Today it says that my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday. \n  * **The health monitor** , which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges. Today, all five are within range.\n  * **The stress monitor** , which I guess tells me how stressed I am. I don't find this useful. \n  * **A \"daily outlook\" button I can press**. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach--more about that in a minute. \n  * **Today 's timeline**, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they'll show up here.\n  * **Recommendations for tonight 's sleep**, including a recommended bedtime.\n\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current \"plan\" (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like [_heart rate variability_](https://lifehacker.com/what-your-heart-rate-variability-says-about-your-health-1847517391) (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that's still in beta. \nAlong the top of the screen, I can select tabs that are specifically for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain tab is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. Today, for example, it suggests that I take on a \"moderate\" level of Strain, between 8.9 and 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. As I write this, I haven't done any workouts or left the house, and I'm at 2.7 Strain just from a morning of sitting around.\n## The Whoop Coach can help you plan your day--but don't ask it to get too specific.\nLet's return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you'll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app's metrics and recommends workouts for the day. \nToday it compliments me on completing a running workout yesterday, and tells me my workout schedule has been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far this week. It then describes a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate has improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery today is lower than my usual. \nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It tells me to aim for three liters of water today (that's a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I can meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to \"support recovery,\" since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest. \nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nThe Whoop Coach suggests three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They include a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says \"Commit,\" and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me. \nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise \"get 8.9 Strain\" is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is _all_ you get. I've asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it's time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn't have that functionality. \nIt _does_ offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice--in theory. The Whoop Coach, like many AI chatbots, cannot do math and can't make sense of its own output. I asked it for specific intervals for the 30-minute run it recommended, and instead it gave me three different workouts I could try, none of them adding up to 30 minutes. I asked again for a 30-minute workout that meets my strain for the day, and it gave me a \"30-minute run plan\" that adds up to 25 minutes, and does not include any zone 2. It helpfully provides this as a card with a \"commit\" button, but the workout on the card is different still--a 28-minute workout, with three minutes in zone 2, and none of the numbers adding up to what the bot wrote to me in the text of our conversation. You can see the screenshots above.\nSometimes, after enough back-and-forth, the AI can provide something useful. But it's just not good enough to rely on for workout ideas. I found that the best way to use it is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but based on Whoop's feedback I might see if I can swap that with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week. \n## How to use Whoop's sleep metrics and features\nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways. \nOn your Sleep tab, you'll get a score for your sleep \"performance,\" comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn't match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though--I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late. \nI think it's a fool's errand to worry about how \"accurate\" sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here's what I get today: \n  * Light sleep: 5:02 (Oura: 5:22)\n  * Deep sleep: 2:36 (Oura: 1:41)\n  * REM sleep: 1:46 (Oura: 1:37)\n  * Total: 9:18 (Oura 9:22)\n\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you're likely to sleep better. (I have [_data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends_](https://lifehacker.com/health/what-ive-learned-from-four-years-of-tracking-my-health-with-the-oura-ring)--total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\nWhoop also tracks your \"sleep debt,\" or how much sleep you needed but didn't get. Six times in the past month I've had a \"high\" sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less. \n### Sleep coach and smart alarms\nOne of Whoop's most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It's also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the \"tonight's sleep\" card on your overview screen.) \nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to \"reach my sleep need\" (making up any sleep debt, as needed); \"improve my sleep,\" which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or \"reach my weekly plan goal,\" which I'll say more about below. \nAnd then, there's a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you'd like to wake up at an exact time, or when you've met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you're \"in the green.\" That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you're not going to be dead on your feet. \nRealistically, I don't use these features too often. I _do_ have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I'm not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature. \n## Tracking your habits with the Journal\nLeft: the journal screen you'll see each day. Right: the screen where you can choose your journal questions. Credit: Beth Skwarecki\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance. \nThis is where the [_Journal_](https://zdcs.link/QVX2rL?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Journal&short_url=QVX2rL&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don't like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps--for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well. \nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses _and_ five noes. Anything that you _almost always_ do, or that you _almost never_ do, isn't going to be very helpful. So I've narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I'll answer differently from night to night, or things I'm trying to improve on. \nOne important caveat: **leaving the question blank doesn 't count as a yes _or_ a no**. At first I only answered a question if I could say \"yes,\" and otherwise I'd leave it blank--for example, answering \"yes\" if I'd had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with seven yeses and zero noes for alcohol, Whoop couldn't give me any reports that used that information. I was able to backfill the last few days' worth of journal entries, but you can't go back more than about a week. \nCorrelation, not causation--but interesting to see. Credit: Beth Skwarecki\nThat extra week's worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that's how Whoop represents it--these are correlations, and Whoop doesn't actually know what's causing what. For example, taking melatonin hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or is this just a correlation where I take melatonin when I'm already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop's credit, it includes a note that \"this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don't track.\" \nThe two things that _do_ help my recovery, according to Whoop's insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime--8% improvement--and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration was just me answering a yes/no question each day. \nBy the way, you can speed up the process of clicking all the little yes and no boxes by tapping the box that says \"use previous answers.\" It will set the answers to whatever you marked yesterday, and then you can manually change the ones that are different.\n## Making a weekly plan\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor _everything_ for _every_ outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks: \n  * **Boost fitness** : increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n  * **Feel better** : increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do \"any recovery activity\" three days per week\n  * **Sleep deeper** : increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose: \n  * Get 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n  * Avoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n  * Meet my hydration goal five days per week\n\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I'm doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I'd like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it's a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n## Viewing weekly and monthly reports\nCredit: Beth Skwarecki\nFor when you _do_ want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly \"performance assessments\" that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data. \nFor example, my monthly report for April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don't wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this--as I said, I only really wear it when I'm testing features or writing a review--but man, I would _love_ this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.) \nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: \"Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.\" My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don't) with the times the app recommended for me. \n## What isn't worth paying attention to\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say _most_ of it isn't worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don't need to do that. \nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don't need to check on every day. \nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to: \n  * Don't overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases. \n  * Don't read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn't perfect. The exception would be if you're feeling truly awful--you're sick or something--in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app. \n  * Remember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation--as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it _when I expect_ to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of. \n\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel--I'm fine, probably--I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I'll think I'm OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn't recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "content": "Google is bringing AI image editing to Gemini, which means that you can use text-based prompts in the Gemini app or website to tweak existing images. This feature has been available in [Google AI Studio](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/ \"open in a new window\") for some time, and Google is now rolling it out to all Gemini users, with support for 45 languages. Google says you will be able to use conversational prompts to edit both AI-generated images and photos uploaded from your phone or computer.\n## What you can do with Gemini's AI image editing\nThe most appealing part of this feature is that it lowers the entry barrier for editing photos. You can have a conversation with the Gemini AI chatbot to have it generate an image, or upload any of your photos into the chat window, and then ask the AI to edit the photo. It's similar to the [Google Pixel's Reimagine feature](https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-pixel-9-review#disappointing-ai-additions), which lets you add fake objects to real photos. \nYou can use Gemini's photo editing tools to replace certain objects in a photo, alter the background, and even add entirely new elements from scratch. In [its blog post](https://blog.google/products/gemini/image-editing/ \"open in a new window\") announcing the new feature, Google gives an example, saying you can upload your own photo and ask Gemini to change your hair color to see how you'd look after a dye job. The AI also remembers your previous requests, so you can ask it to make multiple changes to your image across different messages. Google also claims that you can use this feature to generate a story and images to go with it.\nThere are [ethical concerns with features like these](https://lifehacker.com/tech/elon-musks-ai-image-generator-grok-update), with the most obvious being that they could be used to create fake images that could cause real harm to people or businesses. To help prevent this, Google says all AI-generated images will have an invisible watermark. It's also experimenting with using a visible watermark on these photos, too, which could help identify AI-edited images more easily. \nSince this feature is only starting its rollout today, it may be a while before you're able to use it. This feature won't be available for Google Workspace and education users.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Whatever happened to chunky mashed potatoes? There's a lot of hype for the silky, nearly pudding-like variety of mash--which seem to be the only kind served at restaurants these days--but for me, nothing beats a heaping pile of fluffy smashed potatoes studded with knobbly bits of soft, uncrushed tuber. \nAnd if you too are a supporter of chunky mashed potatoes, you can use your stand mixer to get the best consistency.\n## Stand mixer versus hand-mashed potatoes\nThere is nothing wrong with hand-mashing potatoes, but I'd like to bring stand mixer mashing to your attention simply because after I tried it, I couldn't help but appreciate the difference in consistency. I hadn't even expected to feel the difference on my palate--I was only testing out the method to see if it served a practical purpose. \nSurprisingly, just by scooping a dollop into a bowl, I could feel that the texture was lighter than when I hand-mash potatoes in a pot. (And I didn't even use a whisk attachment.) I then ate said bowl of spuds, and experienced an airiness that didn't fade even after it cooled down. Whenever I mash by hand, the potatoes are soft but still dense, and they sit heavily. Not these--this batch was almost whipped, with more consistently sized bits of unmashed potato. (Maybe this is a me-thing, but if I hand mash potatoes for their chunkiness, I usually wind up with a few embarrassingly large pieces that somehow make it through my masher.)\nAs far as those practical purposes are concerned, mashing with a stand mixer is great if you need to multitask with multiple dishes, quickly free up the stove after boiling, or if you have limited strength or mobility. \nRegardless of your reasons, here's how I do it.\n## How to make mashed potatoes with a stand mixer\n### 1. Boil or steam your spuds\nWhen making mashed, I prefer to [_steam my potato pieces_](https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/steam-mashed-potatoes) because it's faster, but you can stick to boiling if you like. (Steaming only takes about 15 minutes because you only need to boil a half-inch of water rather than a gallon.) The type of potato is also up to you, but I use russets for their high starch content, which can yield a more fluffy mash.\n### 2. Toss in the hot taters and flavoring ingredients\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nOnce your potatoes are fork-tender, carefully (don't burn yourself) toss them into the bowl of the stand mixer. Don't wait for them to cool down; they should still be piping hot. As America's Test Kitchen explains in their [_baked potato post_](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/144-the-perfect-baked-potato \"open in a new window\"), breaking open the potato (in our case, the potato hunks) while hot allows more steam to escape, leading to a fluffier, lighter texture. Add in your favorite ingredients, a few knobs of butter, some salt, pepper, and chives if you're into that. Don't add your liquid ingredient yet.\n### 3. Mash\nCredit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann\nAttach a paddle attachment to the stand mixer and turn the machine on the lowest speed. Allow the mixer to do the work for about three to five minutes. You're looking for a uniform texture, and for the butter to be fully incorporated. Stop the machine if you have to so you can get a better look at how the potatoes are breaking down. \n### 4. Add the liquid\nDuring those three minutes, pour your measurement of liquid (whether it's milk, cream, or a combination of the two) into a microwave-safe measuring cup. Heat it until steaming. Keeping the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly pour the liquid into the mashed potatoes. Once the liquid has been incorporated, bump the speed up one or two notches and let it mash for another 20 seconds or until you like the texture. Taste, and adjust the seasoning if necessary.\nTop your taters with a swirl of gravy and enjoy the fluffiest chunky mashed potatoes you've ever experienced.",

    "title": "How (and Why) to Use Your Steam Deck's 'Desktop' Mode",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nThe Steam Deck makes your PC games feel like they were built for handheld gaming, but it's kind of like a fancy illusion. Under the hood, the Steam Deck is essentially a Linux PC that employs a user interface made for a controller. What that means is that you, the user, can easily dive under that hood with Steam's Desktop interface and start modding and tweaking your games, just like you would on a regular gaming PC.\nWhen you're in Desktop mode, you'll find a full Linux desktop environment (specifically, KDE Plasma) complete with Firefox for browsing the web, a file manager, and the full desktop Steam interface. While it works a little differently than something like Windows, if you're used to tweaking settings or modifying your game files in Steam, this mode will seem familiar.\nThis is also the mode you'll need to access if you want to install third-party launchers, mod your games, or run emulators. There's so much power waiting for you behind a simple change in interface. Here's how to get started.\n## How to access Desktop mode\nValve has made it remarkably easy to swap to Desktop mode, and it shouldn't be intimidating to anyone. Here are the steps:\n  1. Press the **Steam button** (underneath the left touchpad).\n  2. Select **Power**.\n  3. Select **Switch to Desktop**.\n\n\nThat's it. Easy, right? Keep in mind, this is technically restarting your console, so if you're in the middle of a game, save any progress you have. After a brief black screen, you'll see a desktop UI with a few desktop shortcuts and a toolbar along the bottom. \n## How to navigate the desktop on a Steam Deck\nWhile you can technically connect a mouse and keyboard to use this as a desktop, you don't have to. There are a few basic controls you'll need to learn, but once you do, you'll be able to navigate just like it was any other PC.\n  * **The touchscreen.** First and foremost, since this is a touchscreen, you can tap directly on anything on the screen. It's not the most precise method, but it should be mentioned up front.\n  * **The right trackpad is your mouse.** Just like the touchpad on your computer, you can use the right trackpad to control the desktop cursor.\n  * **The left trackpad is your scroll wheel.** It can be a little wonky, but swipe up and down on the left trackpad and you can scroll through websites or menus that have focus. \n  * **Click and right-click with the right and left triggers, respectively.** To click on something, press the right trigger. To right-click on something, press the left trigger. Yes, it sounds counterintuitive when you describe it, but once you're doing it, it feels a lot more natural.\n  * **Press Steam + X to pull up the on-screen keyboard.** This is the least intuitive part of the interface, but if you need to enter text, press Steam + X. This shortcut will invoke the virtual keyboard. You can then dismiss it when you're done by pressing the keyboard icon on the bottom right.\n\n\nThese basic controls will let you navigate the vast majority of the desktop interface. It might feel a little cumbersome at first, but you get the hang of it quickly. With that in mind, you can start messing around in your Steam Deck's files.\n## Install non-Steam game launchers\nSteam might be the default official game store for the Steam Deck, but you can technically install others. In the past, this was a bit of a hassle, but long-suffering volunteers have made tools [_to make it easier than ever_](https://www.dexerto.com/tech/nonsteamlaunchers-steam-deck-2808063/ \"open in a new window\"). You can install launchers like [_GOG Galaxy_](https://www.gog.com/galaxy \"open in a new window\") and [_even Epic Games Store_](https://www.thegamer.com/steam-deck-how-to-install-epic-games-gog/ \"open in a new window\") with a little effort.\nKeep in mind that none of these are officially supported, and you should research install methods specifically for the Steam Deck to get them working. The Steam Deck runs on a Linux build, and it's only able to run Windows applications through the frankly magic [_Proton compatibility layer_](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton \"open in a new window\"). You're venturing into buggier territory with this path, but you can find access to a ton of games you couldn't have otherwise played with the default Steam Deck setup.\n## Start modding your games\nModding is one of the best ways to breathe new life into your favorite games, and Steam is usually super friendly to it. While there's not an easy way to do it from the default Steam Deck, its desktop mode opens that world right up. You can use Firefox to browse popular mod sites like NexusMods and the Dolphin file browser to dig through your game files.\nSince you can also access the desktop version of Steam, it's easier to go through your game files. Right-click (that is, left trigger) on any game in your Library, select **Properties > Installed Files**, then click on **Browse** to pull up the folder where that game's files are located.\nIn some (rare) cases, it can be even easier. NexusMods is currently developing [_a Steam Deck version of its mod manager app_](https://www.nexusmods.com/app \"open in a new window\") that currently officially supports _Stardew Valley_ , with more games planned for future support.\n## Connect peripherals for the full PC experience\nWith the Steam Deck's USB-C port, you can connect a wide range of peripherals that let you effectively turn your Deck into a whole PC. Valve even has [_an official docking station_](https://zdcs.link/QGg0pV?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=an%20official%20docking%20station&short_url=QGg0pV&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\") (though you can also find cheaper ones [_from companies like Anker_](https://zdcs.link/QxAOqP?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=from%20companies%20like%20Anker&short_url=QxAOqP&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")). It also supports Bluetooth connections for wireless keyboards and mice. With this you can connect:\n  * **External monitors.** The Steam Deck has a 1280x800 panel (either IPS or OLED, depending on your model), which is great for its size, but it's hardly high res. If you'd rather play your games on something bigger and more detailed, you can connect an external monitor to play on.\n  * **Keyboards and mice.** Obviously, Steam and its games were designed with a PC interface in mind. While the Steam Deck has done a great job of making games feel at home on a handheld, you can always connect a mouse and keyboard as a fallback. This also makes navigating desktop mode easier.\n  * **External hard drives.** One of the biggest downsides of the Steam Deck is its limited storage capacity. Rather than constantly redownloading your games, you can plug in an external drive and swap out your games from there, via desktop mode. You'll save a ton of time (and bandwidth) over deleting and redownloading.\n  * **Ethernet adapters.** The Steam Deck is at its best when you're playing single-player games, in my opinion. However, if you'd like to occasionally use it for online play, you might get better latency over an Ethernet connection. Docking stations can add this functionality while docked without having to invest in a whole laptop.\n\n\nIf you only ever use a Steam Deck in handheld mode, you'll probably have a great time. The experience is so refined at this point that you'd be forgiven for thinking every game on Steam was designed with the handheld in mind first. However, if you're willing to brave less conventional waters, the Steam Deck's desktop mode is a gateway to the kind of tinkering power normally reserved for the full-fledged PC crowd.",

There are also physical buttons, which are much easier to hit without needing to look down mid-run. The GPS is surprisingly accurate, as is the heart rate tracking feature.\nThe watch also calculates your VO2max and uses that data to predict your race times for a 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and full marathon. These predictions are pretty accurate, but usually a bit on the optimistic side, according to Beth's review. As you can with most Garmin watches, they are very customizable, from screen watches to workouts. The data you see or don't see can be easily edited in the companion Connect app.\nBeth got about 14 days of battery life from the smaller 265S watch. They are mostly the same watch with [very subtle differences](https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-garmin-forerunner-265-vs-garmin-forerunner-265s). The main thing you should worry about is getting the right size for your wrists so it fits well and generates accurate readings.",

    "title": "How Apple's Loss in Court May Benefit You, Even if You Don't Play 'Fortnite'",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "_Fortnite_ is coming back to the iPhone next week, [according to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499 \"open in a new window\"). That may not sound like huge news to those of you that have never played _Fortnite_ , but the game's return follows a court ruling that has implications for many other apps you likely use every day.\nThe [ruling](https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control \"open in a new window\"), from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, states definitively that Apple is no longer allowed to stop developers from linking to purchases outside the App Store or limit them from explaining where such purchases can be made.\nWhat does this mean practically? Well, have you ever tried to subscribe to Netflix, upgrade Spotify, or buy a Kindle book on your iPhone? These things can't be done right now, at least not through the iPhone apps. You also won't find any language explaining this inside those apps. Instead, you'll have to go onto a web browser, make the purchases there, then go back to your phone to access the movie or book, etc. This odd situation is the result of a tangle of policies between the big tech companies--one that's hostile to users.\nCurrently, Apple demands that all commercial transactions inside apps go through the App Store itself. The company claims this is for security and ease of use, but Apple also happens to take a sizable cut of all App Store transactions. This means, should Netflix allow users to subscribe inside the app, it would have to pay Apple a large percentage--between 15 and 30 percent--to Apple _every month_. Until recently, Apple also forbade companies from linking to external websites where transactions can be made or even referencing that such alternative places to pay exist.\nDifferent companies have responded to this in different ways. Epic Games, which owns _Fortnite_ , pulled its apps from the App Store entirely. Some companies, including Netflix, don't offer any signup options in the app at all, and hope that users will figure out they need to sign up elsewhere. Some companies just charge more to App Store customers: YouTube Premium, for example, costs $18.99 per month in the App Store but only $13.99 if you sign up in your browser. Some companies, like Patreon, use a different tactic: If you sign up to support someone on Patreon using your iPhone, [30 percent of your monthly contribution goes straight to Apple](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/27991664769677-How-iOS-in-app-purchases-work-on-Patreon \"open in a new window\") instead of to the creator you wanted to support.\nThe ruling will have implications for all such companies, allowing them to explain these things inside the app while also linking to alternative places to subscribe. Spotify [told The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/659313/spotifys-comment-on-todays-epic-v-apple-ruling \"open in a new window\") that it will soon add a link to its web-based subscription inside its iPhone app. Apple, for its part, intends to appeal the ruling, meaning the situation could change. For now, though, companies are a bit more free to link to and talk about alternative ways to make purchases.",

    "title": "The 18 Coolest Vampire Movies for Fans of 'Sinners'",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nThough the marketing was a bit cagey, it's clear by this point that Ryan Coogler's latest, the critical and box office powerhouse _Sinners_ , unashamedly throws vampires into its genre-busting mix. Set largely in 1932, the movie follows a couple of twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) returning to their backwater hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi to set up what they hope will be a lucrative juke joint--but not before navigating through old relationships and dealing with the Klan leader who owns the sawmill the two are looking to buy. By the midway point, all the more grounded elements feed into a larger narrative that blends magical realism, action, and horror. It's a thoroughly distinctive vision, it has already made a great deal of money, and it's an early Oscar favorite--so look for studios to learn the wrong lessons and unleash a stream of generic vampire movies. \nSo watch a non-generic one. None of the 18 movies collected here is particularly like _Sinners_ , other than the vampire angle--but just as Ryan Coogler's movie uses vampires as a starting point, these movies all twist undead lore into wildly different shapes to form wildly different, consistently cool, stories.\n## _Ganja & Hess_ (1973) \nA meditative, sultry, and entirely experimental horror film, writer/director Bill Gunn's _Ganja_ stars Duane Jones (_Night of the Living Dead_) as Dr. Hess Green, who is attacked by his assistant with a knife belonging to a fictional ancient African tribe. He's subsequently compelled to drink the blood of his assailant, an act that completes his vampiric transformation. Shortly thereafter, the assistant's wife shows up looking for her husband and, even once she realizes what happened, begins a love affair with the doctor. Stylish and deliberately paced (a lot of vibes; a little plot), the movie has some smart, and very barbed, points to make about assimilation and religious hypocrisy. Spike Lee remade it in 2014 as _Da Sweet Blood of Jesus_ but, with respect to Lee, you're much better off with the original. **You can stream _Ganja & Hess_ on Tubi and Kanopy or rent it from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/aBpj2M?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=aBpj2M&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Ganja & Hess (1973)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/aBpj2M?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Ganja%20%26%20Hess%20%281973%29&short_url=aBpj2M&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ (2014)\nIranian-American writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ would make a list of cool vampire movies on its gorgeous black-and-white style alone: Gliding down the streets of an Iranian town in her chador, The Girl (Sheila Vand) cuts an iconic figure, even when we learn that her eerie way of movement has to do with a concealed skateboard. But Amirpour has a lot of fun with the idea that a girl traveling a deserted street in the dark might be a threat far more than a potential victim, and that a chador might be less a symbol of oppression than a means of staying concealed until the moment comes to strike. **You can stream _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ on Kanopy or rent it from [Apple TV+](https://zdcs.link/z7Ed8P?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV%2B&short_url=z7Ed8P&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)  at Apple TV+ Learn More  Learn More  at Apple TV+ ](https://zdcs.link/z7Ed8P?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=A%20Girl%20Walks%20Home%20Alone%20at%20Night%20%282014%29&short_url=z7Ed8P&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Dracula's Daughter_ (1936)\nLike father, like daughter in this direct sequel to the Bela Lugosi film, with Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden, in full Garbo mode) running afoul of Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing from the original. The two vampires share in common not just an archnemesis, but an eye for the ladies, as well, with Countess Zaleska seducing first despondent Lili and then kidnapping Janet. What it lacks in style (not being nearly a match for Todd Browning's film in that regard) it makes up for in sheer horniness. Producers and censors were nervous about the lesbian of it all in the lead-up to the film's release, but also chose to hype it up in the marketing, especially with the very on-the-nose tagline: \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" **You can rent Dracula's Daughter from[Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/aR3JwK?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=aR3JwK&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Dracula's Daughter (1936)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/aR3JwK?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Dracula%27s%20Daughter%20%281936%29&short_url=aR3JwK&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Bit_ (2019)\nNicole Maines (_Supergirl_) stars here as Laurel, a trans teenage girl who's off to sunny LA following her transition.

Many vampire narratives derive pathos from the idea of people trapped in a state of dull, unchanging immortality. _Shadows_ takes that notion and mines it for solid laughs. **You can rent _What We Do in the Shadows_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QKONWB?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QKONWB&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ What We Do in the Shadows (2014)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/QKONWB?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=What%20We%20Do%20in%20the%20Shadows%20%282014%29&short_url=QKONWB&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Daughters of Darkness_ (1971)\nErotic bisexual vampire movies, believe it or not, had a moment in the 1970s; few (if any) were more successful, and more genuinely sexy, than _Daughters of Darkness_. The movie has a look and feel that borders on arthouse, with a grand and elegant style, as well as a willingness to go deeper with themes (western decadence, gendered power dynamics, etc.) that have been discussed in many an academic context in the decades since. If all that makes it sound like a bore, I'll repeat that it's still very much an erotic bisexual vampire movie. Delphine Seyrig plays Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who happens upon a newlywed couple honeymooning in a remote region, and immediately sets about seducing the wife away from human sexual and moral conformity. **You can stream _Daughters of Darkness_ on Tubi and Shudder or rent it from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/znXGvb?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=znXGvb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Daughters of Darkness (1971)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/znXGvb?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Daughters%20of%20Darkness%20%281971%29&short_url=znXGvb&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _The Lost Boys_ (1987)\nIt might not be the gayest vampire movie (there's a _lot_ of competition), but it may well be the sweatiest. Directed by out gay director Joel Schumacher (several years before he made the gayest superhero movie, _Batman & Robin_), _The Lost Boys_ finds brothers Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric) Emerson moving with their family to sunny, schvitzy Santa Carla, California--just in time for Michael to be seduced into joining a sexy vampire gang by its blonde leader David, played by Kiefer Sutherland. The vamps bait Michael with Star (Jamie Gertz), but his desire for the girl gives way to a fascination with David that leads him down a very bloody path. **You can rent _The Lost Boys_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/z7Ed0E?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=z7Ed0E&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ The Lost Boys (1987)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/z7Ed0E?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=The%20Lost%20Boys%20%281987%29&short_url=z7Ed0E&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Cronos_ (1992)\nGuillermo del Toro begins in this deeply unconventional vampire movie, the writer/director's debut. In the 16th century, an alchemist invents the titular device: a steampunk-ish scarab that conceals a creature inside. When it's rediscovered in the present by Jesus Gris (played by del Toro favorite Federico Luppi), it injects the man with an elixir that makes him (a bit) younger, and gives him a vampire's thirst for blood. Complicating matters, a dying oligarch who'd been on the trail of the Cronos isn't very happy that someone else gets the use of its powers, so he sends his relentless thug of a nephew (Ron Perlman) to hunt it down. The imagery is weird and endlessly inventive and, what's more, del Toro injects enough dark comedy around the edges so that the proceedings never bog down in self-seriousness. **You can stream _Cronos_ on Max and The Criterion Channel or rent it from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QxXBKx?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QxXBKx&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Cronos (1992)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/QxXBKx?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Cronos%20%281992%29&short_url=QxXBKx&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Blade II_ (2002)\nA decade on from _Cronos_ , Guillermo del Toro directed this rather brilliant action spectacle--a blood-soaked good time that blends its disparate elements into a propulsive thrill ride that knows exactly what kind of movie it is. Wesley Snipes is at his sassy best as the title's vampire/vampire hunter, while every set piece is bright and colorful, and the vampires are thoroughly monstrous. Practical effects and an artist's eye turn a comic-book action movie into an essential. **You can rent _Blade II_ on [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/924AdE?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=924AdE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Blade II (2002)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/924AdE?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Blade%20II%20%282002%29&short_url=924AdE&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Nadja_ (1994)\nA fascinating novelty from director Michael Almereyda, _Nadja_ is based (roughly) on Andre Breton's French surrealist manifesto of the same name; when financing for such an adaptation fell through (a near-instantaneous process), David Lynch (who also appears) stepped in and paid for the whole thing. To save money and achieve a particular look, Almereyda filmed vampire point-of-view shots on a Fisher-Price camera. All of which is to say that this is unlike other vampire movie. Two plot points kick off the film: First, the death of Count Dracula at the hands of his old nemesis, Van Helsing (Peter Fonda)--traumatizing his daughter (Elina Lowensohn); then, that same Nadja seeking out the _daughter_ of Van Helsing to have sex with so that she can make her a thrall and carry out her goal of getting revenge on the Van Helsing family. It's an arty take on blood, gore, and horny lesbian vampires. **You can stream _Nadja_ on [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QWw3DA?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QWw3DA&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Nadja (1994)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/QWw3DA?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Nadja%20%281994%29&short_url=QWw3DA&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Thirst_ (2009)\n\"What if we took Emile Zola's non-supernatural 1868 novel _Th erese Raquin_ and made it into a vampire horror film?\" said writer/director Park Chan-wook (_Oldboy_), apparently. The novel is about an orphan forced into a miserable marriage with a droopy hypochondriac who begins a torrid, ill-fated affair. Here, the orphan is Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin), and the dashing man with whom she's having an affair is Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho), a one-time Catholic priest who developed vampiric hungers following an experiment gone wrong. Wildly stylish, and fascinating in being surprisingly faithful to a book that has nothing at all to do with vampires. **You can rent _Thirst_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/924AYe?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=924AYe&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Thirst (2009)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/924AYe?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Thirst%20%282009%29&short_url=924AYe&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Only Lovers Left Alive_ (2013)\nIs _Only Lovers Left Alive_ a horror movie? A Gothic romance? A stoner-ish comedy? Um...yes? Indie writer/director Jim Jarmusch, who'd already put his distinctive stamp on other genres (like the idiosyncratic western _Dead Man_), turned his camera to horror. The movie follows a vampire couple, both alive for centuries but now living a world apart: Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a sullen and moody musician living in a trashy Detroit apartment, while Eve (Tilda Swinton) lives a cheerier life in Tangier. She brings Adam along with her to give him a change of scenery and get him out of his gloomy rut, where she encourages him to get out to live a little, or whatever the undead equivalent is. **You can rent _Only Lovers Left Alive_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/aoXwAm?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=aoXwAm&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/aoXwAm?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Only%20Lovers%20Left%20Alive%20%282013%29&short_url=aoXwAm&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Interview With the Vampire_ (1994)\nIt's great that the modern TV-series adaptation dispenses with the subtext and gets real as to the relationship between Lestat and Louis, but this 1994 adaptation walks impressively close to that edge. Vampires Lestat (Tom Cruise) and Louis (Brad Pitt) set up housekeeping in moody New Orleans, \"adopting\" daughter Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and generally making a glorious mockery of the all-American family unit. **You can rent _Interview with the Vampire_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/z3RoEq?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=z3RoEq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Interview With the Vampire (1994)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/z3RoEq?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Interview%20With%20the%20Vampire%20%281994%29&short_url=z3RoEq&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Martin_ (1977)\nGeorge Romero manages to pack an extensive exploration of vampire lore into a film that may or may not even involve a vampire--it's not much a spoiler to offer that we're never entirely clear whether the vampirism of Martin (John Amplas) should be taken literally. From a family steeped in Eastern European folklore and myth, Martin develops a driving need to drink blood, a need that leads him to drug his victims and then slice into their veins with a razor. As usual, Romero has a lot to say, but here he's expertly playing on notions of vampires as sexual stand-ins (the impotent Martin role-plays the highly sexualized vampire attacks of earlier movies), and Romero also invites us to question our fascination with Martin even as he's engaged in repulsive acts. **You can stream _Martin_ on [Tubi](https://tubitv.com/movies/100013768/martin \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Martin (1977)  at Tubi Learn More  Learn More  at Tubi ](https://tubitv.com/movies/100013768/martin \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Let the Right One In_ (2008)\nOne of the finest vampire movies, certainly of this century, is unexpectedly poignant, even as it doesn't skimp on the brutality. Bullied Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) meets and befriends Eli (Lina Leandersson), a girl who appears to be about his age, but who is (you won't be surprised to learn) a vampire. Though very different, the two bond over their shared status as outsiders in the gloomy Swedish suburb of Blackeberg. **You can stream _Let the Right One In_ on Kanopy or rent it from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QPpqLD?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QPpqLD&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Let the Right One In (2008)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/QPpqLD?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Let%20the%20Right%20One%20In%20%282008%29&short_url=QPpqLD&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Stake Land_ (2010)\n_Stake Land_ 's vampires are neither sexy nor subtle. They're fully animal creatures that stalk an apocalyptic wasteland--cutting to the chase as to what a world with vampires might quickly come to look like. As a thriller, it's gory and effective, but a movie _just_ about humans on the run from scary vampires would be less interesting than what we get here: As is so often the case, it's the humans who remain the scariest threats. Religious fanatics calling themselves The Brotherhood are convinced that vampire are God's will, a punishment for sins and, as a result, they're perfectly happy to help the hungry beasts feed. **You can stream _Stake Land_ on Tubi, Kanopy, [Peacock](https://zdcs.link/zj4L1e?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peacock&short_url=zj4L1e&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****, and[Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QKON7j?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QKON7j&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Stake Land (2010)  at Peacock Learn More  Learn More  at Peacock ](https://zdcs.link/zj4L1e?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Stake%20Land%20%282010%29&short_url=zj4L1e&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Blood Relatives_ (2022)\nWe're talking about cool vampires here, but this comedy from director Noah Segan is about a terminally uncool vampire (played by Segan), who discovers that he's the father of a grown young woman (played by a great Victoria Moroles) who inherited his vampirism, in part, and wants to connect with her dad following the death of her mom. Mostly, she just has nowhere else to go. In and among the snappy dialogue and sharp characterizations, Segan has fun puncturing vampire lore in the story of a guy who initially has no interest in connecting with his daughter, but then has a change of heart. **You can stream _Blood Relatives_ on Shudder or rent it from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/QPpqJj?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=QPpqJj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Blood Relatives (2022)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/QPpqJj?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Blood%20Relatives%20%282022%29&short_url=QPpqJj&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")\n* * *\n## _Dracula_ (1931)\nIf it's hard to imagine a time when horror wasn't a powerhouse movie genre, that's because it's been that way since 1931, the year that Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula sashayed onto the screen. Tod Browning's film was a prestige adaptation of a classic novel, before it occurred to anyone to treat horror as B-level entertainment, so there's no corner-cutting in Dracula's impeccable style. Though it gets a bit stagey in its second half, the movie gives us some of horror's most indelible imagery--scenes and shots we're still referencing nearly a century later. Bela Lugosi's Dracula has been endlessly parodied and imitated, but all of that's only possible because he made one hell of an impression. **You can rent _Dracula_ from [Prime Video](https://zdcs.link/a5YZrN?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&short_url=a5YZrN&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")****.**\n[ Dracula (1931)  at Prime Video Learn More  Learn More  at Prime Video ](https://zdcs.link/a5YZrN?pageview_type=RSS&template=content&module=shop-card&element=offer&item=offer-btn&element_label=Dracula%20%281931%29&short_url=a5YZrN&u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss \"open in a new window\")",

    "title": "This Spyware Warning From Apple Is Actually Real",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Scams are a dime a dozen these days--so much so, you're pretty safe ignoring most of the messages you receive from unknown senders. But every now and then, an uncommon message isn't a scam, spam, or malicious in intent; in fact, sometimes, it's an official message from none other than Apple, warning you that you're being spied on. \nAs much as this situation sounds like classic spam, it's very much not: [Apple actually did send alerts to users on Wednesday](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/ \"open in a new window\") warning them they might be targeted by \"mercenary spyware attacks.\" Two of the users Apple alerted were Ciro Pellegrino, an Italian journalist for Fanpage, and Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch right-wing activist. You can see an excerpt of the alert below:\n\"\n\"Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-...This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it's never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning -- please take it seriously.\"\n\"\nThis isn't the first time Apple has sent users this type of warning. In fact, the company [sent a round of warnings to users back in July](https://mashable.com/article/apple-spyware-notification-warnings-july-2024 \"open in a new window\"), complete with the same message as noted above. They did the same [in April of 2024](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/ \"open in a new window\"), as well. \n[According to an Apple support document on the subject](https://support.apple.com/en-in/102174 \"open in a new window\"), the company has sent alerts multiple times each year since 2021, now to over 150 countries in total. The specifics of the attempted attacks are limited, since Apple doesn't want to reveal how it is able to detect the risks to users. While that's understandable, it means users are left knowing they're likely the target of a spyware campaign, but without knowing from who or where.\nTo be clear, the vast majority of users receiving these alerts are not your everyday iPhone customers. Most of the users Apple believes are being targeted by spyware work in high-profile positions that attract attacks from state actors. Think politicians, journalists, activists, diplomats, etc.--people who expose secrets or have power that other people in power would like to stop. Bad actors spend millions of dollars to target these users in elaborate spyware campaigns, attempting to install malware on their devices in an effort to spy on location, data, and activity.\n[Perhaps the most notable spyware of this kind is Pegasus](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-your-iphone-or-ipad-is-infected-with-peg-1847455178), which was created by the Israeli-based NSO Group to spy on a host of high-profile targets the government sees as \"threats.\" What makes spyware like Pegasus particularly dangerous is it requires no action on the part of the target: Bad actors can infect iPhones and Androids with Pegasus silently in what's known as a \"zero-click\" attack, and track just about everything the target does on their smartphone. \n## What to do if you receive this alert\nIf you do receive one of these alerts, the first step is to ensure it's real. The company will send alerts via iMessage and email: iMessage alerts are sent from [threat-notifications@apple.com], while email alerts are from [threat-notifications@email.apple.com]. Before April of this year, Apple sent both from the @apple.com domain.\nEven if you confirm the address, sign into [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/ \"open in a new window\") and look for the threat notification at the top of the page. If Apple really sent you one, you'll see it here. Otherwise, assume the message is fake. Apple says its alert will **never** ask you to click a link, open a file, or install an app or profile, so if the \"alert\" asks you to do this, ignore it. These are classic tactics to trick users into installing the very malware a true alert would try to protect you from.\nThe company also recommends you reach out to the non-profit Access Now and use [their Digital Security Helpline](https://www.accessnow.org/help/ \"open in a new window\"). While they won't be able to offer you specific advice about your situation, they will be able to walk you through general steps to secure yourself. \nWhether you receive an alert, or your work involves one of these at-risk positions, Apple strongly encourages you to [enable Lockdown Mode on your Apple devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120 \"open in a new window\"). Lockdown Mode restricts many of the basic functions of your Apple devices, to plug potential holes bad actors can exploit to compromise those devices. This includes blocking things like message attachment types, web technologies in Safari, and incoming FaceTime calls. The feature also removes your location from shared photos, and stops configuration profiles from being installed on your device.\nAs Lockdown Mode limits the features of your iPhone or Mac, it's not something that most people should use on a daily basis. However, for those who may be targeted by bad actors, it can be a great line of defense. [You can follow our guide here to enable Lockdown Mode](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-lockdown-mode-on-ios-16-and-macos-ventura-1849179969) on your Apple devices to protect yourself.",

The smartwatch is rated IP68 for dust and water resistance (you can submerge it up to 164 feet underwater).

    "title": "You Can Watch YouTube on Your Peloton Now",
    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Big news for Peloton fans: As of this week, you can watch plain old YouTube on your Bike, Bike+, Tread, or Row. Now, you may be saying, \"YouTube TV was already an option in my Peloton's Entertainment tab. What's the big deal?\" The big deal, my friend, is that YouTube TV is a subscription television service and YouTube is, well, YouTube. This new integration allows you to watch standard videos on the platform, the same as you would on your phone or computer. \n## How to access YouTube on the Peloton\nYou access YouTube the same way you access other non-class features, like scenic rides or [my beloved _Lanebreak_ game](https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-lanebreak-rhythm-game-review): through a special tab in the menu on the bottom of your screen. Specifically, it's in the **Entertainment** tab. (If you hit that tab and don't see it, don't worry. Sometimes, Peloton's software updates roll out in waves. You'll have it eventually.) \nJust tap YouTube and you'll be taken to a landing page that initially shows you Peloton's channel on the video-sharing platform. You can log into your YouTube profile by signing in with your Google Account or just use it as a guest. At the top of the screen, you'll be prompted to start a workout if you'd like your resistance, cadence, and output to be tracked and monitored while you ride and watch. \n## Why I love this as a Peloton option\nOver the years, I've kind of fallen out of love with watching shows or movies while I do my cardio. I just feel like I don't move with enough intensity when I'm that distracted, which is why I prefer classes or the _Lanebreak_ game. That said, I know that lots of people prefer or even need to be distracted to get their cardio in and if the option to watch YouTube gets more people on the bikes or treadmills, I am all for it. \nI tested the feature out this morning, first signing into my Google account and then searching for what I wanted to watch. There are a lot of spin classes available on YouTube and I have friends who watch those while they ride non-Peloton bikes at home. As I've explained in my [Peloton Bike review](https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-review), the classes that are designed for your Peloton and available through the associated app are always your best option, since they're made with your specific equipment in mind and track how well you're doing with that equipment, but if you ever feel like watching a different class, this is now an option. \nPersonally, I opted to watch something I knew would get me hyped up, so I put on Lady Gaga's cinematic masterpiece, 2011's \"Marry the Night\" video. I play this song in [the spin classes I teach](https://lifehacker.com/health/group-fitness-etiquette-i-wish-everyone-knew) all the time, but the video is something extra special to me. It worked flawlessly. There was no lag, the image was crisp and clear, and I could see my cadence and resistance at the bottom of the screen the whole time, just like I can when I'm taking a proper Peloton class. Being able to watch one of my favorite music videos actually did push me pretty hard. It wasn't until my end-of-workout review that I realized how fast or hard I'd been going or how many calories I torched. The video on my screen really sucked me in. \n## What to keep in mind if you're watching YouTube on your Peloton\nThis is an awesome option if you want to do something besides a class, _Lanebreak_ , or a scenic ride, but bear in mind that you won't have any cues from pros while you do it unless you're watching a YouTube spin class. I hesitate to recommend this if you're super new, but I say this as an instructor who is worried about your safety. Take a few classes first, if you haven't already, so you have an understanding of proper form and technique. \nI also know a lot of people get sucked into heavy YouTube holes. It's awesome to ride for a long time, but be careful to set some limits or keep track of how long you've been at it. Hydrate frequently and take some breaks. This isn't the same as falling into a YouTube binge on your couch; you could over-exert yourself without realizing it.",

Additionally, Roku said it's adding Sports Zone to more regions across the world, starting with Mexico. \n## More short-form content on display\nIn the All Things Food and All Things Home sections, Roku will show dedicated rows for short videos. If you'd like to watch short clips related to food or homes, Roku will make it easy to do so. \n## An upgraded Roku app\nCredit: Roku\nRoku's mobile app is getting the ability to use your phone as a remote for the TV. The app is also adding more details to its content pages, such as cast, crew, trailers, and IMDb ratings. This will let you get useful information about the content you're watching without having to leave the app.\n## A trivia game for nerds\nRoku's Daily Trivia game is back [after a brief pause](https://cordcuttersnews.com/rokus-beloved-daily-trivia-game-pauses-temporarily-but-roku-says-its-coming-back/ \"open in a new window\"). The game shows you 10 questions every day and after you're done, you can take a look at content related to the topics in the quiz. The trivia section now boasts improved visuals, and lets you access questions from older quizzes as well.\n## Access Roku City whenever you want to\nThe Roku City screensaver is quite popular among users of the company's devices. It's a fake city that appears if your Roku is idling. With these updates, a Roku City tile will appear on the device's home screen, allowing you to visit the fictional locale whenever you want to. Roku also announced that Backdrops, its wallpapers functionality, is coming to its devices in Canada. The feature has been available in the US for a while now.",

    "kind": "news",
    "content": "Raycast on the Mac is a [powerful keyboard-based launcher](https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-raycast-extensions). It's quite popular in [Mac productivity circles](https://lifehacker.com/11-lesser-known-apps-everyone-should-install-on-their-m-1850326614), and you can think of it as a customizable version of Spotlight. You can add extensions to it, use it for math, [create custom shortcuts](https://lifehacker.com/tech/raycast-latest-update-easier-create-new-keyboard-shortcuts-mac) with it, search for files, and now, of course, talk to AI, using a floating window on top of anything on your Mac.\nApple users have requested an iPhone version of Raycast for a long time. But things that Raycast can do on the Mac, like access the clipboard, trigger extensions, and manage windows and files, just aren't possible on the iPhone and iPad. But [Raycast for iPhone is finally here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raycast/id6503428327 \"open in a new window\") after all, and it's just the beginning.\n## Raycast AI on iPhone\nCredit: Raycast\nRecently, Raycast has become kind of an all-in-one AI tool, providing you with access to the latest and greatest models from ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Deepseek, and more at one low monthly price. You get 50 messages for free, and the $10/month [Raycast Pro plan](https://www.raycast.com/pro \"open in a new window\") provides you with access to smaller models like GPT mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku. The $20/month plan opens that up to the models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and more.\nCredit: Khamosh Pathak\nRaycast on the iPhone carries the same design language as the Raycast app on the Mac. When you open the Raycast app on iPhone, you'll see a text box at the bottom, and a Voice button. On the top of the page, there are shortcuts to view all your AI conversations, Notes, Snippets, and Quicklinks. The middle part can be customized to add any AI or Raycast action shortcut that you wish.\nBy default, you'll talk to Raycast AI using the app's own Ray model, which is based on GPT-4. But you can tap on the Model button to switch to any available model, including any custom AI models that you might have built on Mac. You can also add attachments, ask follow up questions, and more.\n## Notes, Quicklinks and Snippets\nCredit: Raycast\nWhen it comes to productivity, the Raycast iPhone app brings over three Mac features: Notes, Quicklinks, and Snippets. If you're paying for the $10/month Raycast Pro subscription, you'll see that all your notes, Quicklinks and Snippets from your Mac will show up automatically on the iPhone (using the Cloud Sync feature).\nBut even if you aren't, you can still use these features for free on the iPhone; they just won't sync to your Mac. You can create 5 notes for free using Raycast Notes.\nYou'll also be able to export notes in HTML, Markdown and in rich text.\nQuicklinks and Snippets are let you do a bit more, though. [Quicklinks](https://www.raycast.com/core-features/quicklinks \"open in a new window\") let you create shortcuts for launching any URL with a tap. This URL can take you directly to a part of an app, or website.\nSnippets is Raycast's version of a text expansion tool, and is a more robust version of the built-in Text Replacement tool on iPhone and Mac. Here, you can create text-based shortcuts that expand into any saved text, like your address, or a work email template, easily.\n## A ways to go\nAnd that's all there is so far. Currently, Raycast thinks of the iPhone app mostly as a companion to the more powerful Raycast utility on the Mac. According to an interview with Raycast co-founder Petr Nikolaev (via [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/apple-ios/658265/raycast-ios-launcher \"open in a new window\")) the goal for the Raycast app was to put something in front of Raycast users and see how they respond. The developers plan to build on top of this foundation using the feedback from users. If the Raycast app on iPhone is successful, they also plan to build an Android app (a [the Windows app](https://www.raycast.com/windows \"open in a new window\") is already in the works).\nCurrently, Raycast supports the Shortcuts framework that makes it easy to open the AI chat and other features directly from Control Center, or the Lock screen. But it's not the same as replacing Siri or Spotlight Search. According to the co-founders, they would love to bring extensions support to the iPhone app, but Apple's sandboxed environment won't allow for it. Although, they are excited about a potential custom keyboard implementation that would let them bring some of the Raycast features into other apps using the system keyboard.",

He attributed the issue to Dormann not being registered with Commvault, which prevented him from accessing and applying the appropriate update.\n## Did Not Test Patched Version\n\"Commvault engaged with the researcher to walk through the process for manually updating the software and installing the patch, which he did successfully,\" Camp wrote in emailed comments. Dormann has since [revised his original post](https://infosec.exchange/@wdormann/114468096144992418) to reflect that fact, he added. \"However, we think it's important to note that the correct information was available prior to this security researcher's post and [[Dark Reading's story](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/researcher-patched-commvault-bug-exploitable')],\" Camp wrote. \"This was not a situation where the patch didn't work; it’s a situation where the researcher was not testing on a patched version.\"\nCVE-2025-34028 (CVSS score 10.0) is a pre-authentication server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in Commvault's management interface that gives attackers a way to [completely compromise](https://documentation.commvault.com/securityadvisories/CV_2025_04_1.html?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) an affected Command Center environment. The flaw affects versions 11.38.0 to 11.38.19 of the Windows and Linux versions of Commvault Command Center. Commvault disclosed the flaw, along with a fix for it in versions 11.38.20 and 11.38.25 of the software on April 17 after researchers at [watchTowr](https://labs.watchtowr.com/fire-in-the-hole-were-breaching-the-vault-commvault-remote-code-execution-cve-2025-34028/) discovered the flaw and reported it to the company. In a post earlier this week, Dormann wrote that his tests of watchTowr's proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw showed it worked even against Commvault's updated software versions.\nRelated:[Organizations Fix Less Than Half of All Exploitable Vulnerabilities, With Just 21% of GenAI App Flaws Resolved](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/organizations-fix-less-than-half-vulnerabilities)\n[Multiple researchers have expressed concern](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/max-severity-commvault-bug-researchers) over CVE-2025-34028 because it enables attackers to potentially gain highly privileged access to critical data backup and recovery environments, which ransomware actors, for instance, like targeting. Commvault has said there is no sign of exploit activity targeting the bug after its recent disclosure.\n## Updated Process\nAccording to Dormann, prior to Commvault's conversation with him, Commvault only offered 11.38 updates to systems that were registered with the vendor.\n\"The 11.38 version of Commvault is what's referred to as the 'Innovation Release' of the software, where the expectation is that 'Pioneer customers' register with Commvault and are specifically approved to even see updates that are available,\" Dormann wrote in a [social media update](https://infosec.exchange/@wdormann/114468096144992418) on Wednesday. \"The problem with this: Customers who fire up a Commvault 11.38 VM through Azure or the like did not [go] through the front door of registering with Commvault. As such, they would NOT SEE UPDATES AVAILABLE. This was ... not ideal.\"\nRelated:[AI Code Tools Widely Hallucinate Packages](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/ai-code-tools-widely-hallucinate-packages)\nIn comments to Dark Reading, Dormann says users who got their appliance on Azure or AWS had no knowledge of the updates at all. When such a system would check for updates, none would be available and so it would incorrectly say that it was up to date. \"Up until [May 7], 11.38 systems from Azure or AWS would never get updates,\" he says. \"They would all report that they are up to date. This was just fixed hours ago.\"\nDormann says that Commvault has changed its back end to ensure that the updates that fix CVE-2025-34028 are now available to all Commvault 11.38 users via a manual download process. \"It's perhaps worth noting that the version number alone isn't enough to know if a 11.38.20 or 11.38.25 system is vulnerable or not,\" he says. \"You'd have to check the Additional Updates are installed, again as outlined in my Mastodon post.\"\nThe relevant additional updates are SP38-CU20-433 and SP38-CU20-436 for 11.38.20 and SP38-CU25-434 and SP38-CU25-438 for 11.38.25.\nRelated:[10 Bugs Found in Perplexity AI's Chatbot Android App](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/11-bugs-found-perplexity-chatbots-android-app)\nCommvault, for its part, said it immediately offered the patch to all customers with paid licenses. It was only a small number of individuals testing out Commvault on a free trial basis, including on AWS and Azure, who were not able to immediately deploy the patch. \"Now, free trial users in addition to licensed customers can successfully patch at the same time, and this will be our approach moving forward,\" Camp wrote.\nIn addition, Commvault has updated its security advisory to provide additional instructions on how to verify if the patch was successfully deployed. \"This guidance applies to all licensed customers and those using Commvault on a trial basis,\" Camp wrote.\nCommvault provides a range of data backup and recovery technologies to enterprise customers worldwide, including several large companies, including Astra Zeneca, ADP, 3M, ING, Sony, and Panasonic. \n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#98a7ebedfaf2fdfbeca5dbf7f5f5eef9edf4eca2b8ceedf4f6fdeaf9faf1f4f1ece1b8c8f9ecfbf0b8cff7eaf3ebb8f9ebb8d1f6ecfdf6fcfdfcbef9f5e8a3faf7fce1a5d1bdaaa8ecf0f7edfff0ecbdaaa8ecf0fdbdaaa8fef7f4f4f7eff1f6ffbdaaa8feeaf7f5bdaaa8dcf9eaf3bdaaa8cafdf9fcf1f6ffbdaaa8f5f1fff0ecbdaaa8f1f6ecfdeafdebecbdaaa8e1f7edb6bda8dcbda8d9bda8dcbda8d9bdaaa8dbf7f5f5eef9edf4ecbdabd9bdaaa8ceedf4f6fdeaf9faf1f4f1ece1bdaaa8c8f9ecfbf0bdaaa8cff7eaf3ebbdaaa8f9ebbdaaa8d1f6ecfdf6fcfdfcbda8dcbda8d9f0ecece8ebbdabd9bdaadebdaadeefefefb6fcf9eaf3eafdf9fcf1f6ffb6fbf7f5bdaadef9e8e8f4f1fbf9ecf1f7f6b5ebfdfbedeaf1ece1bdaadefbf7f5f5eef9edf4ecb5e8f9ecfbf0b5eff7eaf3ebb5f9ebb5f1f6ecfdf6fcfdfc)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\n[Jai Vijayan, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

Now, details are emerging, and it says that based on the ongoing investigation, the affected data may include fund, management company, and portfolio information, banking and tax information, and the personal information of current and former employees. It will notify individuals whose data was impacted on a rolling basis.\nThe firm detected an unauthorized third-party accessing Insight information systems earlier this year through what it called a \"sophisticated [social engineering attack](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/social-engineering-smarter).\"\nSuch attacks involve a cybercriminal masquerading as a trusted organization or someone its victim knows before convincing them to hand over sensitive information such as credentials or bank account details. Alternatively, they may encourage the victim to visit a malicious site or click a link leading to malware installation. Just one successful social engineering attack can have [dire consequences for the entirety of an organization](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/twitter-employees-compromised-in-phone-spear-phishing-attack).\nAfter discovering the attack and the intrusion, Insight Partners went to contain the incident and began an investigation soon after, alongside third-party cybersecurity experts and a forensic expert. \"We don't believe, based on what is known, there will be any material impact on portfolio companies, Insight funds or other stakeholders,\" the company [initially stated](https://www.insightpartners.com/ideas/statement-from-insight-partners-on-cyber-incident/).\nInsight Partners focuses its investment on technology, software, and Internet businesses, including cybersecurity companies such as Armis, Checkmarx, Recorded Future, SentinelOne, and Wiz. It's unclear whether or not these portfolio companies were affected and to what extent if so.\nAs for now, the company is recommending that individuals protect themselves and their organizations by practicing adequate cybersecurity hygiene practices such as changing personal and enterprise passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, monitoring financial accounts and credit information, implementing a fraud alert with credit bureaus, and considering freezing their credit reports.\nRead more about:\n[News Briefs](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/news-briefs)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\n[Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Unlike most other infrastructure, we're not just fighting Murphy's law — our opposition is the creativity of other humans. Software exploitation isn't just a technical problem — it's a thriving, sophisticated marketplace with professional sellers, brokers, and buyers. While your security team focuses on vulnerability counts and compliance checklists, attackers are calculating their potential return on investment.\nWhat's the market rate for exploiting your company's software? I've spent more than a decade watching this market evolve, and the most effective defensive strategy I've seen isn't about eliminating every vulnerability — it's about making exploitation of your systems more costly than attacking alternative targets. \n## Measuring the Attacker's Investment\nFew companies have succeeded in dramatically increasing [the cost to exploit their software](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/its-cheap-to-exploit-software-major-security-problem). But when it happens, the yields are striking. Take Android: 10 years ago, a [working Android zero-day exploit](https://www.wired.com/story/android-zero-day-more-than-ios-zerodium/) cost around $100,000 on underground markets. Today, that same caliber of exploit fetches upward of $2.5 million. That's a 200% growth in exploit cost every year, dramatically outpacing inflation and most investment returns.\nRelated:[Life Without CVEs? It's Time to Act](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/life-without-cves-time-act)\nThis price surge isn't happening because attackers suddenly have bigger budgets. It's happening because Google invested millions in making Android exploitation harder — requiring more specialized knowledge, researcher time, and sophisticated techniques to bypass defense-in-depth protections. Meanwhile, legacy enterprise systems with minimal security investment likely grow cheaper to exploit over time as their surface area expands faster than the security team can keep up.\n## Why Compliance Doesn't Stop Attacks\nUnfortunately, most organizations remain trapped in compliance-oriented thinking that does little to change these economics. Their programs focus on risk management rather than risk reduction, investing in regulatory checkboxes that pass audits but don't meaningfully increase the cost structure for attackers.\nThis disconnect explains why breaches continue despite skyrocketing security budgets. Companies are spending millions to comply with frameworks that don't reflect economic reality. A stark example comes from the healthcare sector, where organizations routinely pass all [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/hipaa-security-rules-pull-no-punches) (HIPAA) security requirements with flying colors, only to suffer massive data breaches months later. These failures aren't technical — they're economic.\nRelated:[AI Agents Fail in Novel Ways, Put Businesses at Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-agents-fail-novel-put-businesses-at-risk)\n## Measuring Your \"Cost to Exploit\"\nHow do you assess your organization's exploitation cost? For companies with public software-as-a-service (SaaS) endpoints, [bug bounties](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/google-pays-nearly-12m-2024-bug-bounty-program) are a good starting point to determine the minimum cost. Beyond that, think like an adversary, not an auditor:\n  * Map the surface area: For most organizations, the span of what you're required to protect is immense, from marketing websites that may have been forgotten to intern laptop endpoints to rogue engineering teams spinning up AWS instances. The first fundamental issue in security is just visibility. [To quote Rob Joyce,](https://www.theregister.com/2016/01/28/nsas_top_hacking_boss_explains_how_to_protect_your_network_from_his_minions/) former head of Tailored Access Operations at the National Security Agency (NSA): “If you really want to protect your network you have to know your network, including all the devices and technology in it. In many cases we know networks better than the people who designed and run them.”\n  * Look for local minimums in cost to exploit: A one-day vulnerability is thousands of times cheaper or just free, compared to a zero-day. So, there's no sense in deploying technology designed to defend against zero-days if you're failing to patch vulnerabilities for which exploits are now freely available.\n  * Think beyond the perimeter: Accept that you won't be able to protect every part of the perimeter, and plan for it to be penetrated. What will happen next? Zero-trust architecture on networks, canary systems to detect intrusions early, segmentation to contain breaches, and playbooks for incident response are crucial to minimize the blast radius of a breach.\n\n\nRelated:[Meta Wins Lawsuit Against Spyware Vendor NSO Group](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/meta-wins-lawsuit-spyware-vendor-nso)\nThese metrics matter far more than raw vulnerability counts. A system with 10 easily discoverable and exploitable vulnerabilities is fundamentally less secure than one with 100 vulnerabilities that each require months of specialized work to exploit.\nThis framework provides a clear way to demonstrate security return on investment (ROI). Instead of reporting \"We patched 50 vulnerabilities,” what would it take to report \"We increased our minimum cost to exploit by 35% by implementing these specific controls\"?\nThe economics of exploitation directly affects your breach risk in measurable ways. As your cost-to-exploit increases, attackers face a critical decision point where the investment required exceeds their expected return. This creates a powerful risk reduction effect: When exploitation costs rise above certain thresholds, entire categories of attackers drop out of the threat landscape targeting your organization. \n## Building Exploitation Economics Into Your Program\nTo increase your cost to exploit, I recommend focusing on a few tactics. First, shift security left in the development process — meaning integrate security earlier in the software development life cycle rather than at the end. This strategy exploits the power law distribution of vulnerability costs: Fixing a security flaw during design might cost $100, during development $1,000, and in production $10,000 or more. The earlier you integrate security, the higher the economic barrier and the more your application security program reflects modern development practices that prevent issues rather than just detecting them.\nSecond, layer your defenses. Effective security requires attackers to solve multiple hard problems simultaneously. Modern mobile operating systems excel at this: Successful exploitation often requires chaining multiple vulnerabilities types: information disclosure, privilege escalation, etc. before gaining code execution.\nThird, work with engineering to eliminate entire vulnerability classes. When entire categories of weaknesses disappear, attackers must invest in discovering novel attack vectors rather than reusing known techniques.\nMost organizations focus incorrectly on perfect threat prevention rather than making exploitation economically unattractive. You don't need to make your system unhackable — you just need to make it economically irrational to try.\n## Security as Economic Deterrence\nTo sell this approach to leadership, speak their language. Would your CFO rather hear \"We need another scanning tool\" or \"We can increase the cost to attack us by 50% with these specific investments\"?\nOver the next decade, I expect we'll see security teams explicitly tracking \"cost to exploit\" as a key performance indicator, with chief information security officer (CISO) bonuses tied to measurable increases in this metric. Forward-thinking companies are already building security economics into their strategy, reframing security not as a cost center but as an economic deterrent.\nThe ultimate goal isn't security perfection — it's making exploiting your organization unprofitable. We're not just fighting entropy, we're fighting other creative humans. If it's sufficiently difficult to exploit you, they'll turn to an easier target.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b38cc0c6d1d9d6d0c78efbdcc493e0d6d0c6c1dac7ca93fbd2c093f0dbd2ddd4d6d793c7dbd693fbd2d0d8d6c193fed2c1d8d6c7c3dfd2d0d695d2dec388d1dcd7ca8efa968183c7dbdcc6d4dbc7968183c7dbd6968183d5dcdfdfdcc4daddd4968183d5c1dcde968183f7d2c1d8968183e1d6d2d7daddd4968183dedad4dbc7968183daddc7d6c1d6c0c7968183cadcc69d9683f79683f29683f79683f2968183fbdcc4968183e0d6d0c6c1dac7ca968183fbd2c0968183f0dbd2ddd4d6d7968183c7dbd6968183fbd2d0d8d6c1968183fed2c1d8d6c7c3dfd2d0d69683f79683f2dbc7c7c3c09680f29681f59681f5c4c4c49dd7d2c1d8c1d6d2d7daddd49dd0dcde9681f5c5c6dfddd6c1d2d1dadfdac7dad6c09ec7dbc1d6d2c7c09681f5dbdcc49ec0d6d0c6c1dac7ca9ed0dbd2ddd4d6d79edbd2d0d8d6c19eded2c1d8d6c7c3dfd2d0d6)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/isaac-evans)\n[Isaac Evans](https://www.darkreading.com/author/isaac-evans)\nCEO, Semgrep\nIsaac Evans is the leader of [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a company improving software security and reliability.

The vendor has copped to new actively exploited vulnerabilities in January, February, and April of this year. Last week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added [two older, already addressed SonicWall vulnerabilities](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/two-sonicwall-vulnerabilities-under-exploitation) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\nAnd on May 7, SonicWall published a security advisory regarding [three further issues](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2025-0011) affecting the company's Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 Series appliances, including models SMA 200, 210, 400, 410, and 500v, and versions 10.2.1.14-75sv and earlier. In combination, the three could grant an attacker essentially unfettered control over an impacted device.\n## CVE-2025-32819\nThe first vulnerability, CVE-2025-32819, is the most severe of all three, with a \"high\" 8.8 rating in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). It's also, arguably, the most interesting of the bunch.\nBack in 2021, researchers from NCC Group discovered an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in SMA 100s, which attackers could exploit even without having to be logged into a targeted device. As far as anyone can tell, it never received a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) listing, but SonicWall did patch it with a simple authentication check. What SonicWall didn't do was address the underlying issue.\nRelated:[Microsoft Readies Administrator Protection Option for Windows 11](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/microsoft-readies-administrator-protection-option-windows-11)\n\"This often happens when there's some sort of proxy in place for communication between product teams and security researchers, or perhaps the initial security research [around a vulnerability] puts a focus on a certain aspect of exploitation, and that doesn't translate to the product teams,\" says Ryan Emmons, security researcher at Rapid7. \"In this case, the idea might have been to patch that underlying root cause, but I think they took a reasonable stab at it by adding authentication.\"\nCaitlin Condon, director of vulnerability intelligence for Rapid7, adds, \"Vendors are, generally speaking, under quite a lot of pressure to provide very, very narrowly tailored patches in a very short span of time for vulnerabilities like this. Certainly it's not a poor reflection on SonicWall in any way that they are trying to do what their customers expect of them within a very short period of time. This is pretty common.\"\nRelated:[Cisco Boosts XDR Platform, Splunk With Agentic AI](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/cisco-boosts-xdr-platform-splunk-agentic-ai)\nNonetheless, because the root cause was left unaddressed, an attacker can still perform the exploit today, so long as they have access to an account associated with a targeted SMA 100. It can be even a low-privilege account, with a guessable or leaked password on the Dark Web, used by some ordinary employee to remotely connect to their company's SSL VPN.\n## The SMA 100 Exploit Chain\nAn attacker can get the most bang for their buck with CVE-2025-32819 by deleting the appliance's main SQLite database. This causes the appliance to restart and, upon restarting, to revert the default administrator account's password to \"password.\"\nBased on known but as yet private indicators of compromise (IoCs) and its own incident response investigations, Rapid7 assesses that this exploit has already been used by attackers in the wild.\nWith possession over a heavy-hitting account, an attacker can get to work with the second and third bugs. First comes CVE-2025-32820 — rated a \"high\" 8.3 on the CVSS scale — which allows them to make any directory on the appliance writable by all users. Then they can leverage that writability with CVE-2025-32821 (CVSS 7.1), inserting a malicious file that executes at the appliance's root level.\nRemote access devices like SonicWall's are designed to be widely accessible across large organizations, they provide access to the sensitive innards of a corporate network, and they aren't always protected with security software equivalent to what other kinds of endpoints enjoy. \"The target is juicy and the visibility is lacking. That's not a great combination,\" Emmons laments.\nRelated:['Digital Twins' Bring Simulated Security to the Real World](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/digital-twins-bring-simulated-security-real-world)\nSo besides updating to the latest firmware version 10.2.1.15-81sv, SonicWall is advising that customers make use of their devices' Web application firewalls (WAFs), scan for unauthorized logins, and enable multifactor authentication (MFA), either directly on their box or via an organization-wide directory service.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\n[Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

BEC attacks were particularly problematic for customers, according to Coalition; claims severity for such threats increased 23%, with incident's costing organizations, on average, $35,000.\nThat dollar figure is a far cry from the average loss for [ransomware attacks in 2024](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ransomware-cyber-insurance-coalition-report/747474/), which Coalition said was $292,000. However, the claims report, which features data from customers in the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia, offered some encouraging data points, including a 7% drop in ransomware claims severity and a 3% decline in claims frequency.\nAdditionally, Coalition found that FTF claims severity fell dramatically by 46%, to an average loss of $185,000, while claims frequency dropped 2%. Overall, the cyber-insurance carrier said it observed \"remarkable year-over-year (YoY) stability\" for claims, despite an intensifying threat landscape where financially motivated attackers continue to develop novel techniques and exploit new vulnerabilities.\nRelated:['Venom Spider' Targets Hiring Managers in Phishing Scheme](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/venom-spider-phishing-scheme)\n## BEC Mitigation Costs Rising\nAccording to Coalition, [email-based attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/insurers-claims-data-recommend-cybersecurity-technologies) like BEC have made up the bulk of claims for organizations over the past three years. The report notes that once attackers gain access to business email accounts, they can use the access to steal sensitive data, compromise additional accounts, and engage in other types of malicious activity.\nFor example, Coalition found that 29% of BEC attacks also led to FTF incidents, with an average loss of $106,000.\n\"FTF events often occur through social engineering tactics or as a direct result of a BEC event: Attackers may pose as executives, vendors, or financial institutions to trick employees into initiating unauthorized wire transfers that can have devastating consequences for businesses,\" the report said.\nAdditionally, Coalition observed a spike in BEC claims severity in the second half of 2024, even though claims frequency for such attacks was stable year over over. \"The spike in BEC severity was, in part, driven by increased prices related to legal expenses, incident response firms, data mining, notifications, and other mitigation and recovery efforts,\" Coalition said in the report.\n\"These are the inputs that go into a successful response, and we can’t specify the elements of each service that may be increasing, but certainly, these services and vendors are all subject to widespread economic pressures,\" says Chris Hendricks, head of Coalition Incident Response.\nRelated:[A Cybersecurity Paradox: Even Resilient Organizations Are Blind to AI Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/even-resilient-organizations-bind-ai-threats)\nHendricks says Coalition also works directly with vendors and service providers to negotiable \"favorable rates at scale\" for its policyholders. The price increases for incident response services may be even larger for businesses seeking the services on the open market, he says.\n## Positive Outcomes\nDespite some increases in claims severity and costs, Coalition's report highlighted several positives from the past year, including the recovery of $31 million in stolen funds. The cyber-insurance carrier cited one example where a distributor for household goods was tricked into wiring $2.1 million to a threat actor that had spoofed the email address of the company's landlord; the company quickly realized the error and contacted Coalition, which notified government contacts to freeze the funds. Coalition said all but approximately $100 was frozen and ultimately returned to the distributor.\nIn total, Coalition achieved at least a partial recovery or \"clawbacks\" of stolen funds in 24% of FTF incidents and full recoveries in 12% of incidents.\nRelated:[Prolific RansomHub Operation Goes Dark](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/prolific-ransomhub-operation-goes-dark)\nSecurity experts typically recommend that organizations implement multifactor authentication and security awareness training to prevent social engineering threats like BEC and FTF attacks. The cyber insurer also said it's imperative for organizations to quickly report suspicious activity or incidents so that it can begin incident response and loop in law enforcement partners.\nCoalition emphasized the importance of remediating vulnerable software. The cyber insurer said it issued more than 85,000 security alerts to policyholders in 2024, which directly led to the mitigation of more than 32,000 security issues, including zero-day vulnerabilities and end-of-life software.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f004c4a5d555a5c4b027a525e5653127d5e4c5a5b1f7e4b4b5e5c544c1f6b504f1f7c465d5a4d1276514c4a4d5e515c5a1f7c535e56524c195e524f045d505b4602761a0d0f4b57504a58574b1a0d0f4b575a1a0d0f5950535350485651581a0d0f594d50521a0d0f7b5e4d541a0d0f6d5a5e5b5651581a0d0f525658574b1a0d0f56514b5a4d5a4c4b1a0d0f46504a111a0f7b1a0f7e1a0f7b1a0f7e1a0d0f7a525e5653127d5e4c5a5b1a0d0f7e4b4b5e5c544c1a0d0f6b504f1a0d0f7c465d5a4d1276514c4a4d5e515c5a1a0d0f7c535e56524c1a0f7b1a0f7e574b4b4f4c1a0c7e1a0d791a0d79484848115b5e4d544d5a5e5b565158115c50521a0d795c465d5a4d124d564c541a0d795a525e5653125d5e4c5a5b125e4b4b5e5c544c125c465d5a4d1256514c4a4d5e515c5a125c535e56524c)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-wright)\n[Rob Wright](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-wright)\nSenior News Director, Dark Reading\nRob Wright is a longtime reporter and senior news director for Informa TechTarget's security team.

The platforms offered [DDoS attacks-for-hire](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/ddos-attack-platforms-shut-down-in-global-law-enforcement-crackdown), also known as stresser or booter services.\nAccording to [Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/ddos-for-hire-empire-brought-down-poland-arrests-4-administrators-us-seizes-9-domains), these platforms were easy to use and required no technical skills. Users entered a target IP address, selected the type of attack they wanted to execute and its duration, and paid the fee.\nThe attacks were capable of flooding websites and servers with malicious traffic, overwhelming even the most well-defended websites and knocking them offline for as little as 10 euros.\nThe arrests were coordinated internationally among law enforcement agencies in four countries, along with Europol's analytical and operational assistance. \nThe US seized nine domains associated with booter services during the operation and Germany identified one of the suspects and shared critical intelligence on the others. Dutch authorities have since deployed fake booter sites to warn potential users searching for DDoS-for-hire services. Booter services offer on-demand attacks and are usually advertised on underground forums on the Dark Web.\nThe operation was coordinated as part of [Operation PowerOFF](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/europol-holiday-ddos-attacks), which is an ongoing law enforcement effort targeting DDoS-for-hire activity.\nIn December 2024, as part of the same operation, law enforcement agencies around the world [seized 27 of the most popular platforms](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/europol-holiday-ddos-attacks) used to execute DDoS attacks. At the time, law enforcement agencies implemented a similar tactic by launching an online ad campaign using Google search ads to highlight the consequences of such attacks and deter individuals from taking part in them. \nRead more about:\n[News Briefs](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/news-briefs)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a996dadccbc3cccadd94e6d9ccdbc8ddc0c6c789f9c6deccdbe6efef89fdc8c2ccda89edc6dec7899089ededc6fa84cfc6db84e1c0dbcc89edc6c4c8c0c7da8fc8c4d992cbc6cdd094e08c9b99ddc1c6dccec1dd8c9b99ddc1cc8c9b99cfc6c5c5c6dec0c7ce8c9b99cfdbc6c48c9b99edc8dbc28c9b99fbccc8cdc0c7ce8c9b99c4c0cec1dd8c9b99c0c7ddccdbccdadd8c9b99d0c6dc878c99ed8c99e88c99ed8c99e88c9b99e6d9ccdbc8ddc0c6c78c9b99f9c6deccdbe6efef8c9b99fdc8c2ccda8c9b99edc6dec78c9b99908c9b99ededc6fa84cfc6db84e1c0dbcc8c9b99edc6c4c8c0c7da8c99ed8c99e8c1ddddd9da8c9ae88c9bef8c9befdedede87cdc8dbc2dbccc8cdc0c7ce87cac6c48c9befddc1dbccc8dd84c0c7ddccc5c5c0ceccc7cacc8c9befc6d9ccdbc8ddc0c6c784d9c6deccdbc6cfcf84ddc8c2ccda84cdc6dec784c7c0c7cc84cdcdc6da84cdc6c4c8c0c7da)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\n[Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

However, what transpired recently regarding MITRE's support of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database was earth-moving on a different level. In a single day, we witnessed a foundational structure for communication between cyber defenders go from \"It's going dark tomorrow!\" to \"Oh, whew, [we have an 11-month extension](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/cve-program-cuts-cyber-sector).\" \nI spent nearly 30 years with MITRE, almost all of it in a cyber-related capacity. During that time, frankly, I took the CVE work for granted. It was always there, always growing and informing defenders. Over the years, it became such an integral part of the language that I didn't really think about it vanishing. That changed recently. \n## How the CVE Database Works\nThe CVE system is the common \"language\" that the global cybersecurity industry uses to exchange information about vulnerabilities. This database assigns a unique number to a vulnerability, so people, when communicating, know they are talking about the same thing. \n[A CVE record](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Common-Vulnerabilities-and-Exposures-CVE) contains details about the vulnerability that can be shared and discussed. It accelerates actions against these vulnerabilities and ensures when something is patched, that this vulnerability (not some other one) is no longer an issue. It is a universal \"language\" that has effects across every computer system and network in every sector. Maintaining it is vital, and losing it would be a bit like removing nouns and verbs from first responders' knowledge of English and trying to talk them through an emergency.\nRelated:[How Security Has Changed the Hacker Marketplace](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/how-security-changed-hacker-marketplace)\n## The Future Remains Uncertain\nGiven the importance of this system, it wasn't a shock that there was a tremendous outcry from the global cybersecurity community for the government to step in — which, thankfully, it did. On the evening before the shutdown, the [MITRE contract from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-extend-funding-cve/745531/) (CISA) was extended 11 months, thus allowing the service to continue. Concerns, however, have not gone away. During the 24 hours of uncertainty, there have been many questions raised about the future of the system and an examination of backstop options, should this happen again. \nMITRE, as a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), has been the key provider of CVE services for the past 25 years, due to the organization's mission of serving the public interest, maintaining a not-for-profit status, and providing deep technical and domain expertise. With the system suddenly threatened, the community rallied and very clearly showed it believes MITRE has performed this service well. MITRE has done a lot for cybersecurity, not just developing the CVE and CWE systems, but also developing and supporting [ATT&CK](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/top-mitre-attack-techniques-how-to-defend-against). These systems and frameworks are used community-wide and play a critical part in how we defend and communicate about nearly every aspect of cyber operations.\nRelated:[AI Agents Fail in Novel Ways, Put Businesses at Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-agents-fail-novel-put-businesses-at-risk)\nDespite all MITRE has done for cybersecurity, it's clear we should not wait 11 months to discuss the service's future. It's simply too important.\nAbout 15 years ago, I was in a very tense meeting with a government leader, where we were sharing the grim reality around a particular vulnerability. This leader leaned back in his chair and said, \"I know you all are freaking out about this, and this is indeed a big deal. But we will think and act better by breathing through our noses, and that's what we'll do.\" What the extension of MITRE's funding has done is give us time to breathe through our noses. Cyber is complex enough, and scrambling for a new foundational approach for sharing vulnerability information is a seismic shift that can't be done overnight. For cyber, CVEs are bedrock. As a nation, and as a global cyber community, we must ensure a successful future, because the alternative is completely untenable.\nRelated:[Meta Wins Lawsuit Against Spyware Vendor NSO Group](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/meta-wins-lawsuit-spyware-vendor-nso)\nOne possible path would be for an appropriate government agency to convene a cross-industry public-private discussion on the future of this program with the goal of establishing long-term resiliency consummate with the level of importance. There have been discussions in this direction which is a very positive thing. This is a big deal. It is time to think clearly, well before 11 months pass and we find ourselves here again.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/keith-ibarguen)\n[Keith Ibarguen](https://www.darkreading.com/author/keith-ibarguen)\nSenior Vice President of Engineering, Trustwave\nKeith Ibarguen is the senior vice president of Engineering at Trustwave, where he leads the company’s engineering product development and SpiderLabs research.

Within a week, the attacker had installed Web shells on two external-facing Microsoft Exchange servers and then updated those backdoors to improve their ability to remain undetected.\nIn the following 20 months, the attackers added more functionality, installed additional components to aid persistence, and deployed five custom attack tools. The threat actors, which appear to be part of an Iran-linked group dubbed \"Lemon Sandstorm,\" did not seem focused on compromising data, says John Simmons, regional lead for Fortinet's FortiGuard Incident Response team.\n\"The threat actor did not carry out significant data exfiltration, which suggests they were primarily interested in maintaining long-term access to the OT environment,\" he says. \"We believe the implication is that they may [have been] positioning themselves to carry out a future destructive attack against this CNI.\"\nRelated:[GPS Spoofing Attacks Spike in Middle East, Southeast Asia](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/gps-spoofing-attacks-spike-middle-east-southeast-asia)\nOverall, the attack follows a shift by cyber-threat groups in the region, which are now increasingly targeting CNI. About a third (34%) of successful cyberattacks in the Middle East are carried out by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, which often focus on government institutions and critical infrastructure, according to [a report released by cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies](https://global.ptsecurity.com/analytics/current-cyberthreats-in-middle-eastern-countries-the-impact-of-digitalization-apt-group-activity-and-the-shadow-market) on May 7.\n## Persistent and Disciplined\nCyber threats in the Middle East will only grow in scale and in sophistication, Alexey Lukash, an analyst with the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, said in a statement sent to Dark Reading.\n\"Governments in the region need to focus on protecting critical infrastructure, financial institutions, and government systems,\" he said. \"The consequences of successful attacks in these areas could have far-reaching implications for national security and sovereignty.\"\nLemon Sandstorm used more than a dozen tools including custom malware, such as HanifNet. Source: Fortinet\nLemon Sandstorm — also known as Fox Kitten and UNC757, among other names — has had a broad focus in the past with activities that include stealing information, causing disruption, and even selling access to ransomware actors, according to [cybersecurity industry and US government assessments](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/irans-fox-kitten-group-aids-ransomware-attacks-on-us-targets).\nRelated:[Malaysian Airport's Cyber Disruption a Warning for Asia](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/malaysian-airport-cyber-disruption-warning-asia)\nIn the latest attacks, the group showed sophisticated operational security and \"exceptional care in establishing and maintaining presence, using rare TTPs and persistence mechanisms,\" Fortinet's Simmons says. \"Even after losing access, they spent months trying to regain entry — first by targeting known, but not publicly exploited, vulnerabilities, and later by attempting spear-phishing attacks using internal intelligence gathered during earlier phases of the intrusion.\"\nThe attackers' disciplined operational security — as well as their use of Farsi religious terms in the bespoke malware — hint at ideological or geopolitical motivations for the attacks, says Nathaniel Jones, vice president of security and AI strategy and a field CISO at Darktrace, an AI cybersecurity platform.\n\"This, combined with targeted brute-force attempts on domain administrator accounts, suggests a nation-state or intelligence-linked actor focused on pre-positioning within critical infrastructure,\" he says. \"The strategic intent appears aligned with achieving national security objectives by holding foreign infrastructure at risk, echoing tactics seen in incidents like Volt Typhoon [linked to China] and [the Russian] GRU-led cyber operations in Ukraine.\"\nRelated:[Malaysia PM Refuses to Pay $10M Ransomware Demand](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/malaysia-refuses-10m-ransom-airport-cyber-breach)\n## Stopped by Segmentation\nWhile the operation used at least five previously unreported malware and attack tools, companies should look to blunt attackers' most commonly used tactics, the researchers stated in the report.\n\"While new cyber tools often generate significant interest, a more critical concern is the widespread reliance on well-established tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a broad range of threat actors,\" the researchers stated. \"Organizations can achieve greater security resilience and return on investment by prioritizing defenses against these common attack methods rather than focusing solely on mitigating the latest malware variants.\"\nLateral movement through remote desktops and file shares, the deployment of web shells, and common offensive open source tools are all typical ways for attackers to extend their compromise through a victim's network. Companies should use multifactor authentication to harden their user accounts against takeover through credential-based attackers and deploy patching as quickly as possible to minimize the exposure to attackers use of n-day exploits.\nThe Middle East-based victim in this case had restricted access to their operational technology by segmenting their network, foiling attackers' attempts to move laterally from the IT environment to the OT environment, says Mark Robson, a principal threat analyst with Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.\n\"The strong network segmentation implemented by the victim outlined in the report noticeably elongated the intrusion and hampered the adversaries progress,\" he says.\nFinally, in addition to improving the resilience of the network, Robson says, companies should frequently practice incident response to enable security teams and others to react quickly to any compromises.\nRead more about:\n[DR Global Middle East & Africa](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/middle-east-africa)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\n[Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

In January, threat actors used it to run more than 50 campaigns encompassing 172 million phishing emails in all. Last month, it was 40 campaigns and more than 100 million emails.\nCoGUI services users in China who, with the rise of such tools as [Lucid](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/lucid-phishing-exploits-imessage-android-rcs) and [Darcula](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/darcula-phishing-kit-impersonate-brand), have been enjoying a [golden era of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS)](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/industrial-scale-asian-scam-centers) in recent months. Technically, CoGUI overlaps with Darcula, though it lacks Darcula's ability to intercept two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and it's oriented toward slightly different use cases.\n\"We observe Darcula currently focused more on mobile and smishing, especially in the US, whereas CoGUI is an email-based threat and it is much higher volume,\" explains Selena Larson, staff threat researcher with Proofpoint. \"The objectives of campaigns are also different — while Darcula campaigns try and steal credit card details by masquerading as low dollar value fees, CoGUI has a much broader lure set that impersonates large companies, many of which have millions of potential users.\"\nRelated:[Billbug Expands Cyber-Espionage Campaign in Southeast Asia](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/billbug-cyber-espionage-campaign-southeast-asia)\nMost noticeably, unlike Darcula or Lucid — responsible for scams spread widely around the world — CoGUI attacks appear to be concentrated almost solely against Japanese people.\n## What to Know About CoGUI\nCoGUI appears to have been around since at least October 2024, although it really hit its stride at the turn of the year. Last December, it was the source of fewer than 20 phishing campaigns, which sent out just over 60 million phishing emails. In January, those numbers nearly tripled. Since January, for reasons as yet unknown, the volume of attacks has steadily decreased.\nThat so many spam emails are evading filters, Larson says, is thanks to the fact that \"the threat actor uses many different email addresses in each campaign, and doesn't typically reuse them, so one email is not responsible for all of them. By using many email addresses and services they are possibly able to bypass spam filters and automated detections based on sender.\"\nSource: Proofpoint\nThese hundreds of millions of emails contain URLs to credential-phishing websites. Before victims reach a fake site, though, the software profiles their system, checking for parameters including the location of the IP address, operating system (OS), language configuration, browser type and version, whether the device is a desktop or phone, and even, in case of the latter, the dimensions of the computer's screen.\nRelated:['Industrial-Scale' Asian Scam Centers Expand Globally](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/industrial-scale-asian-scam-centers)\nNot all CoGUI campaigns are filtering for the same answers — whether an attacker is aiming for Mac computers or Android phones, the victim simply has to fit the profile in order to be met with a realistic phishing page, from which the attacker can harvest their credentials. If they don't fit, they'll be redirected to the legitimate version of the website they thought they were accessing in the first place.\nA plurality of CoGUI campaigns have impersonated Amazon. Other impersonated brands include Apple, Rakuten, Japan's national tax agency, and various Japanese finance companies. Just a few weeks ago, [the Japanese government's](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/japan-offense-new-cyber-defense-bill) Financial Services Agency alerted the public to \"a rapid increase\" in [cybercriminals phishing customers of brokerages](https://www.fsa.go.jp/ordinary/chuui/chuui_phishing.html), then using their accounts to purchase Chinese stocks. Proofpoint couldn't confirm whether any of that activity relates to CoGUI.\nIn addition to Japanese targets, a small number of campaigns have affected users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US, but even those were aimed at people and organizations with ties to Japan. As for why all of these campaigns have been so laser-focused on one demographic group, Proofpoint cannot say.\nRelated:[Japan Warns on Unauthorized Stock Trading via Stolen Credentials](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/japan-unauthorized-stock-trading-stolen-credentials)\nRead more about:\n[DR Global Asia Pacific](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/asia-pacific)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\n[Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

While the failures of large language models (LLMs) may result in the release of sensitive or dangerous information or abusive language, the failure modes identified by Microsoft could lead to agents acting on behalf of the attacker, making bad decisions, or causing harm to the user.\nThese novel failure modes include the compromise of agents, the injecting into a system of rogue agents, or the impersonation of legitimate AI workloads by attacker-controlled agents, according to Microsoft's \"[Taxonomy of Failure Mode in Agentic AI Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/24/new-whitepaper-outlines-the-taxonomy-of-failure-modes-in-ai-agents/)\" paper. Companies need to focus on a holistic approach to security, but some risks are more likely, says Pete Bryan, principal AI security research lead for Microsoft's AI Red Team.\n\"Based on [our] research and experience [with] agentic systems being developed today, there are several issues in the taxonomy that we flag as being more immediate challenges,\" he says. \"These include agent compromise, indirect prompt injection, human-in-the-loop bypass, and memory poisoning.\"\nRelated:[NIST to Implement 'Deferred' Status to Dated Vulnerabilities](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/nist-deferred-status-dated-vulnerabilities)\nThe focus on classifying the risks posed by AI agents into broad groups comes as technologists and AI firms strike a near-hyperbolic tone about an agentic future. AI agents hold the promise of [handling complex tasks](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/gen-ai-accelerates-triage-of-software-vulnerabilities) in existing platforms using only natural language for direction, essentially becoming \"virtual co-workers\" in the enterprise and helping [supercharge productivity](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/ai-augmented-email-analysis-spots-latest-scams), stated management consulting firm McKinsey [in a July 2024 report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai) about Gen AI-enabled agents.\n\"[I]t is not too soon for business leaders to learn more about agents and consider whether some of their core processes or business imperatives can be accelerated with agentic systems and capabilities,\" the McKinsey analysis stated. \"This understanding can inform future road-map planning or scenarios and help leaders stay at the edge of innovation readiness.\"\n## Many AI Approaches, Diverse Defenses\nYet the diversity of AI technologies — with a variety of architecture, capabilities, and objectives — means that enumerating the [risks posed by an AI agentic system](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/nvidia-embraces-llms-and-commonsense-cybersecurity-strategy) remains complex. Knowing which failure modes are the most important for a company to remediate is specific to the AI agents they use, Microsoft's Bryan says.\nRelated:[Deepwatch Acquires Dassana to Boost Cyber-Resilience With AI](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/deepwatch-acquires-dassana-to-boost-cyber-resilience-with-ai)\nIn general, agent compromise, indirect prompt injection, human-in-the-loop bypass, and memory poisoning are the top threats, as cited by Bryan. These attacks could allow an attacker to co-opt an agent, cause harm to users, or erode trust in the system.\nMicrosoft added 10 different novel ways that AI agents could fail, harming security and safety. Source: Microsoft\nIn a case study of memory poisoning, for example, the Microsoft researchers showed that an AI agent that parses email and takes actions based on the content can be easily co-opted — if not hardened against such an attack — by an attacker who embeds a command in an email. Sending an email with a command that modifies that agent's knowledge base, or memory, leads to unwanted actions, such as forwarding messages with specific topics to an attacker.\nCompanies need to model the threats to each AI agent, Bryan says.\n\"Development teams should leverage practices such as threat modeling to help identify and prioritize the issues specific to the systems they are building,\" he says. And techniques like memory poisoning \"can significantly increase overall attack success rates, provide a persistent and difficult-to-detect attack vector for threat actors, and are relatively simple to conduct.\"\nRelated:[Google Launches Open Source Patch Validation Tool](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/google-open-source-patch-validation-tool)\n## Defense-in-Depth for AI\nWhile some companies are worried about the risks posed by AI, security and safety are often not the top concern. In its report, for example, McKinsey made scant mention of the risks of AI agents but did note that about 41% of companies are working to mitigate cybersecurity risk in its [\"State of AI\" report for 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai).\nBecause of the risks posed by AI agents, Microsoft recommends that companies do extensive design reviews, monitor and log agent activity during production, and conduct frequent red-team testing. The best approach distills down to common cybersecurity advice: pursue defense-in-depth, says Microsoft's Bryan.\n\"The most effective place to tackle [these issues] is at the architectural level and earlier in the design process so that developers can start to incorporate them better,\" he says. \"As a foundation, companies should be carefully identifying and implementing trust boundaries between the various components of agentic AI systems, as well as ensuring that, just as with user data, they are not treating the output of generative AI as fully trusted.\"\nOverall, Microsoft recommends that companies heavily monitor AI agents. Tools — such as the Python Risk Identification Tool for GenAI ([PyRIT](https://azure.github.io/PyRIT/)) — can help, but understanding what AI agents are doing and looking out for anomalous behavior will help catch failure modes, Bryan says.\n\"To build confidence in a system's safety and security, companies will need to combine effective threat modeling with automated assessments and manual red teaming prelaunch,\" he says. \"But this also needs to be supported by logging and monitoring in production, as well as continuous automated testing over the lifetime of the system.\"\nMicrosoft released its own AI red-teaming agent for generative AI systems in early April as a public preview.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\n[Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

Coordination among countries is also key. However, it can be difficult to test preparedness on the large scale required.\nNearly 4,000 cyber experts from 41 nations are taking part in this week's 15th annual [Locked Shields live cyber-exercise event](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/preparing-for-the-unexpected-a-proactive-approach-to-operational-resilience) hosted by NATO's Corporative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE). The three-day event (May 6 to May 9) tests the cyber readiness on the country level, with attack simulations against critical systems and infrastructures, like gas, telecommunication, and energy. The focus on critical infrastructure is particularly important, as attackers ramp up their efforts to target systems in the [water and wastewater sector](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366566740/CISA-posts-incident-response-guide-for-water-utilities).\nLocked Shields officially kicked off on May 6 with multinational teams working to defend against cyber crises. Source: @ccdcoe via X\nDubbed the world's biggest live-fire cyber exercise, Locked Shields extends beyond attacks to measure how prepared the countries are to deal with disinformation, political pressure, communication challenges, and legal dilemmas that stem from cyber threats. The countries are organized into 17 multinational blue teams to defend two fictional islands located in the Atlantic Ocean. While some countries sent their teams to Tallin, Estonia, where the event is taking place, others, such as Japan, are joining remotely.\nRelated:[Microsoft Claims Steady Progress Revamping Security Culture](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/microsoft-steady-progress-revamp-security-culture)\nTo mimic the high stakes and intense pressure of a real-life scenario, Locked Shields features more than 8,000 virtual systems under attack. The simulation combines cyberattacks, disinformation, and infrastructure crises, according to NATO CCDCOE. The cyber defense exercise also brings challenges related to quantum computing and AI. The teams are tasked with maintaining services and networks while countering the threats, as well as coordinating effective strategic communications and making decisions under significant time pressure. The goal is to mirror the complex dynamics of what a real-world cyber crisis would look like.\n\"This is where nations train for tomorrow's crises,\" NATO CCDCOE .\nThis year's exercise focuses on a fictional island nation in the Atlantic Ocean. Source: @ccdcoe via X\nCountries will learn how prepared — or not — they are to report, respond to, and communicate during highly disruptive cyber crises. Lithuania is one returning country that revealed [simulation storylines](https://www.baltictimes.com/some_150_specialists_from_lithuania_take_part_in_locked_shields_cyber_defense_exercise/) built on previous exercises, but also \"introduce new challenges and cyber incidents that reflect current geopolitical threats.\" Countries are grouped into teams; Japan and Australia are participating remotely from Tokyo as a joint team.\nAlbania and Czech Republic have been teamed to tackle simulation exercises. Source: @NUKIB_CZ via X\nThis year's fictional scenario covers geopolitical tensions, violations of sovereignty, and large-scale cyberattacks, according [to an Estonian publication ERR](https://news.err.ee/1609685636/locked-shields-2025-cyber-defense-exercise-gets-underway-in-tallinn). The 2025 storyline also includes additional fictional nations and wider regions to emphasize the importance of cyber defense cooperation.\nRelated:[Advanced Preparation Was Key to a Secure Paris Olympics](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/advanced-preparation-key-secure-paris-olympics)\nGermany returns to Locked Shields to test its cyber readiness.

Bringing nations, experts, and partners together in real-time defense is more vital than ever — and we are proud to stand at the heart of that mission,\" said NATO CCDCOE director Mart Noorma.\nRead more about:\n[News Briefs](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/news-briefs)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\n[Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nFeatures Writer , Dark Reading \nArielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.\n[See more from Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Now TikTok is crying foul, saying the company is being \"singled out\" for enforcement despite the company's show-of-good-faith €12 billion investment in its Project Clover data security initiative.\nAccording to [GDPR compliance rules](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/thought-gdpr-compliance-was-hard-buckle-up), any personal data transferred out of the European Economic Area (EEA) must comply with standard EU protections. According to Graham Doyle, the DPC's deputy commissioner, TikTok was unable to prove EEA users' personal data was protected, as it was remotely accessed by staff inside China.\n\"As a result of TikTok’s failure to undertake the necessary assessments, TikTok did not address potential access by Chinese authorities to EEA personal data under Chinese anti-terrorism, counter-espionage and other laws identified by TikTok as materially diverging from EU standards,\" Doyle said in a statement [announcing the fine](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/irish-data-protection-commission-fines-tiktok-eu530-million-and-orders-corrective-measures-following).\nAt the start of the DPC inquiry, TikTok reported that no user data was stored on servers inside China. But in April 2025, TikTok amended that statement to add that in February 2025, the company did find some erroneously stored information.\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\n\"The DPC is taking these recent developments regarding the storage of EEA User Data on servers in China very seriously,\" Doyle said. \"Whilst TikTok has informed the DPC that the data has now been deleted, we are considering what further regulatory action may be warranted, in consultation with our peer EU Data Protection Authorities.\"\n[TikTok ](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/tiktok-ban-backfired-us-cybersecurity)has vowed to appeal the fine. A statement from Christine Grahn, head of policy and government relations at Europe for TikTok, stated the ruling from the DPC fails to take into account the company's €12 billion investment in its Project Clover data privacy initiative.\nProject Clover's investment includes a €1 billion [TikTok](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/tiktok-teen-data-use-probed-regulators) data center being built in Finland. The project also provides oversight of data transfers and security gateways by European company NCC Group. In addition, GDPR-protected data is kept inside data centers across Europe, as well as other controls, according to the company.\n\"The facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,\" Grahn's argued. \"Beyond the DPC's failure to substantively consider the extensive safeguards implemented under Project Clover, we are disappointed to have been singled out despite relying on the same legal mechanism employed by thousands of other companies providing services in Europe.\"\nRelated:[What NY's New Security Rules Mean for Finance Firms](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/nydfs-rules-businesses-ny)\n[Meta was fined](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/meta-hit-1-3b-record-breaking-fine-gdpr-violations) €1.2 billion by the DPC in 2023 for a similar data privacy violation after transferring EU data to the US.\n## Data Sovereignty Is the New Black\nAs TikTok takes its appeal to DPC, other organizations need to be aware this data sovereignty ruling is just the beginning of regulatory actions intended to protect user data, according to John Lynch, director of UK market development at Kiteworks.\n\"The recent ruling by Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) highlights a growing concern about how companies handle data across borders, marking an important shift in how organizations must approach information protection in our increasingly connected world,\" Lynch says. \"This decision represents part of a broader global trend where regulatory authorities are taking stronger positions on data sovereignty, with implications extending far beyond any single company.\"\nAnd business is widely on board.\nThis year's \"Data Privacy Benchmark Study\" from Cisco points out the laser focus on data privacy from the private sector is being directly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence. In fact, a fulsome 86% of the 2,600 global security professional respondents support data privacy and say it has a positive impact on business. An even more positive sign that data privacy is on the rise is that 96% of respondents acknowledge data security investment provides tangible returns above its initial cost, Cisco reported. Another point of broad consensus: 90% agree data is safer when it's stored locally, while nearly the same number (88%) admit localization is expensive.\nRelated:[Experts Debate Real ID Security Ahead of May 7 Deadline](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/experts-real-id-security-may-7-deadline)\n\"This creates a tangible tension between regulatory compliance and operational efficiency,\" Lynch adds.\nA strategy for data localization, according to Lynch, must include advanced rights management to respond to the current threat landscape, pointing to the rise in third-party data breaches. He adds that organizations also need to adopt what he calls \"granular\" access controls.\n\"These security frameworks limit who can view, edit, download, or share based on their role, location, and clearance level — creating environments that follow security best practices while accommodating the complex organizational structures typical of global enterprises operating under regulatory scrutiny,\" Lynch says.\nLynch advises organizations to focus on a comprehensive data sovereignty strategy across the enterprise, rather than focusing on meeting specific compliance regulations.\n“The drive for data localization reflects rising interest in data sovereignty,\" Harvey Jang, Cisco's chief privacy officer, said about the [survey's findings](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2025/m04/cisco-2025-data-privacy-benchmark-study-privacy-landscape-grows-increasingly-complex-in-the-age-of-ai.html). \"Yet, a thriving, global digital economy relies on trusted cross-border data flows.\"\nJang added that the [Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules](https://www.commerce.gov/global-cross-border-privacy-rules-declaration), along with other frameworks, will need to be leveraged to keep businesses from being bogged down by compliance requirements.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\n[Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nSenior Editor, Dark Reading, Dark Reading\nBecky Bracken is a veteran multimedia journalist covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Meta argued that NSO had exploited the WhatsApp vulnerability to deliver the Pegasus spyware to 1,400 users.\n## Surveillance-for-Hire or Anti-Terror Tool?\nA series of [court documents](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.350613/gov.uscourts.cand.350613.467.0.pdf) revealed that NSO Group used at least one more WhatsApp software zero-day vulnerability to target users with the spyware.\nAnd the trial itself shed even more light on the spyware executives and the operations of their \"[surveillance-for-hire system](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/pegasus-spyware-infections-ios-android-devices).\"\n\"Put simply, NSO's Pegasus works to covertly compromise people's phones with spyware capable of hoovering up information from any app installed on the device,” Meta said in its statement. \"Think anything from financial and location information to emails and text messages, or as NSO conceded: 'every kind of user data on the phone.' It can even remotely activate the phone's mic and camera — all without people's knowledge, let alone authorization.\"\nRelated:[Life Without CVEs?

Though the threat actor did not actually deploy Play during the intrusion, it did deploy a custom infostealer called Grixba on the victim system in addition to other malware, Symantec said.\n\"During the attack, the Balloonfly operators deployed a variety of samples and hacktools in addition to the Grixba infostealer and the exploit for CVE-2025-29824 on this machine,\" the security vendor noted. \"Some of the samples aren't available to us at the moment of writing, but they were located in the Music folder with suspicious names masquerading as Palo Alto software (paloaltoconfig.exe, paloaltoconfig.dll) or, for example, 1day.exe.\"\nRelated:['Lemon Sandstorm' Underscores Risks to Middle East Infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/lemon-sandstorm-risks-middle-east-infrastructure)\nCVE-2025-29824, which has a CVSS score of 7.8, is a post-compromise privilege escalation bug in the Windows Common Log File System Driver, which manages logging for different Windows applications and services. Attackers who successfully exploit the bug can gain system-level privileges on affected systems. It was the [only zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft's April update](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-drops-another-massive-patch-update) and garnered attention due to Storm-2460's active exploitation to deliver malware.\nIn urging organizations to quickly deploy the company's patch for the vulnerability, Microsoft noted how threat actors value such bugs because of the privileged access they provide in victim environments, often enabling persistence and lateral movement prior to payload delivery. \"Microsoft highly recommends that organizations prioritize applying security updates for elevation of privilege vulnerabilities to add a layer of defense against ransomware attacks if threat actors are able to gain an initial foothold,\" the company noted in its advisory for CVE-2025-29824.\nIn the Balloonfly attack that Symantec observed, the threat actor may have gained initial access to the victim environment via a public-facing Cisco firewall. They then moved laterally to another Windows machine on the same network to deploy the exploit for the Windows zero-day in addition to other malicious payloads. Symantec said the exploit that Balloonfly used was different from the fileless, in-memory exploit that Storm-2460 had used in its attacks targeting CVE-2025-29824.\nRelated:[Researcher Says Patched Commvault Bug Still Exploitable](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/researcher-patched-commvault-bug-exploitable)\n## Prolific Threat Actor\nBalloonfly, which some vendors also track as the Play ransomware group, first surfaced in June 2022, employing double-extortion tactics by exfiltrating sensitive data before encrypting it. Since then, the group has emerged as one of the most prolific ransomware gangs, with an estimated 300 victims worldwide, according to [Picus Security](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/play-ransomware). One of its tactics has been to encrypt data only intermittently to try and evade detection while also rendering targeted data unusable.\nThe group's victims include organizations — many of them midsized — across sectors, including critical infrastructure and [government](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/oakland-city-services-struggles-to-recover-from-ransomware-attack) in the US, Australia, Italy, and multiple other countries. In 2023, Adlumin reported observing the threat group [targeting managed service providers](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/-play-ransomware-group-targeting-msps-worldwide-in-new-campaign) worldwide in a campaign to distribute malware to their downstream customers.\n\"Play ransomware has emerged as one of the most aggressive cyber extortion groups, using advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate, persist, and evade detection,\" Picus said in its analysis. \"By abusing legitimate tools such as Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, ProcDump, AdFind, and WinPEAS, the group conducts credential theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\"\nRelated:[UK Retailers Reeling From Likely Ransomware Attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/uk-retailers-reeling-ransomware-attacks)\nThe group's use of legitimate commands and tools in executing attacks have made them difficult to detect and stop, the security vendor noted.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\n[Jai Vijayan, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

However, Stroz Friedberg recently observed a threat actor gain \"local administrative access on a publicly accessible server through exploitation of a CVE in an application\" without using the anti-tamper code. Once they managed to disable the EDR, they executed a variant of [Babuk](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/ra-group-emerges-custom-take-babuk-ransomware) ransomware, a widely known ransomware-as-a-service gang first discovered in 2021.\nVulnerable configurations of SentinelOne's [EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/security-end-run-aukill-shuts-down-windows-reliant-edr-processes) — particularly prior to a new option the vendor added that mitigates this issue — have the ability to locally upgrade and downgrade an installation of the product. In this case, the threat actor used the downgrade capability to kick off the attack chain.\nRelated:[How Security Has Changed the Hacker Marketplace](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/how-security-changed-hacker-marketplace)\nTo replicate the attack, Stroz Friedberg researchers tested a Windows 2022 Server virtual machine with SentinelOne EDR software version 23.4.6.223 installed. Stroz Friedberg then ran the MSI Windows installer file for a different SentinelOne version and discovered that the installation process tree, when installing a fresh version, terminates all previously running SentinelOne processes \"approximately 55 seconds before the MSI installer spawned processes for the new agent version.\"\n\"During the time when no SentinelOne processes were active, Stroz Friedberg was able to interrupt the upgrade by terminating the msiexec.exe process associated with the SentinelOne version change by executing a taskkill command from a command prompt running with local administrator permission,\" the research read.\nThis gave the attacker all the time they needed to infect the unprotected endpoint.\n\"Because the old version SentinelOne processes were terminated during the upgrade, and the new processes were interrupted before spawning, the final result was a system without SentinelOne protection,\" Stroz Friedberg said.\nRelated:[Life Without CVEs? It's Time to Act](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/life-without-cves-time-act)\n## SentinelOne Responds\nDark Reading contacted SentinelOne for comment on the report; a spokesperson responded by linking to a customer advisory blog published on the same day as Aon's research.\nAccording to this blog post, the vendor \"immediately issued an update that made it even easier to prevent against such techniques and communicated guidance to all of our customers regarding the new Local Upgrade Authorization toggle switch and how to use it to protect against this type of local bypass attempt.\"\nThe Local Upgrade Authorization toggle removes the ability to perform local upgrades and downgrades and has been enabled by default for all new customers.\nThe vendor said it shared the research with other EDR vendors, \"as the technique is one that could be applied against other endpoint protection products.\"\nIn its research, Stroz Friedberg said it tested SentinelOne's new feature and was unable to perform the EDR bypass as described.

A few lines of infrastructure as code (IaC), a push to deploy, and boom — you're live. It's fast, it's powerful, and it's incredibly efficient. But here's the catch: The same speed that makes IaC amazing also makes it risky. One slip, one exposed secret, and suddenly, you're not just deploying infrastructure — you're deploying a vulnerability.\nSecuring your IaC isn't a nice-to-have. It's nonnegotiable.\nAccording to [Check Point's \"2024 Cloud Security Report](https://www.checkpoint.com/resources/items/cloud-security-report-2024),\" 82% of enterprises faced incidents tied to misconfigurations. And back in 2022, [ICICI Bank](https://cybernews.com/security/icici-bank-leaked-passports-credit-card-numbers) leaked more than 3.6 million files due to a misconfigured cloud bucket. These aren't rare mistakes — they're the result of skipping the basics.\nHere's a streamlined checklist to help you keep your cloud setup tight and secure — without overcomplicating things.\n## 1. Plan With Security in Mind\nBefore you even think about hitting Deploy, take a moment. What are you building? Where's it going: AWS? Azure? What tools need to plug in: Logging? Secrets management? Observability?\nPlanning might not be flashy, but it's your first — and arguably best — line of defense. Just look at [the 2021 Elasticsearch breach](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/breach-database-leak/), where more than 5 billion records were exposed due to a careless setup. How can you avoid being that headline?\nRelated:[AI Domination: RSAC 2025 Social Media Roundup](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/ai-rsac-2025-social-media-roundup)\n  * Define both functional and security requirements.\n  * Choose your cloud environment wisely.\n  * Use tools like Terraform or CloudFormation — and follow their security guides.\n  * Start with hardened OS images or CIS benchmarks.\n\n\n## 2. Lock Down Development\nRemember the [Uber breach](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/uber-breached-again-attackers-compromise-third-party-cloud) in 2022? It started with credentials hardcoded into a private repo. One small oversight led to a major compromise. So, what can you do to avoid this? \n  * Use separate dev credentials.\n  * Lock down code repositories.\n  * Automate builds with CI/CD.\n  * Add SAST plug-ins to your IDE for early detection.\n  * Use secrets managers like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.\n  * Tag everything clearly: version, owner, environment.\n\n\n## 3. Test Like You Mean It\nTesting isn't just about making sure things work — it's about making sure they're secure. [Orca's \"2024 State of Cloud Security Report](https://orca.security/lp/2024-state-of-cloud-security-report/)\" revealed 74% of cloud issues weren't caught until after deployment. That's too late. Wondering how to get ahead of this before it becomes a problem? Verify encryption and least-privilege access.\n  * Test in isolated environments.\n  * Check for drift and compliance.\n  * Use static and dynamic security scans.\n\n\n## 4. Deploy With Confidence\nYou've tested thoroughly — now it's go time. Stick to your CI/CD flow, have backups ready, and if you're using blue-green deployment, double-check your DNS routing. This is where smooth rollouts happen — or where small mistakes go big.\nRelated:[SANS Top 5: Cyber Has Busted Out of the SOC](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/sans-top5-cyber-broken-out-soc)\n  * Follow a repeatable and documented deployment routine.\n  * Ensure all secrets, credentials, and artifacts are checked and secured.\n  * Conduct final validations, including environment health checks and post-deploy tests.\n  * Confirm monitoring is active and alerting works before flipping the switch.\n\n\nThis step is your launchpad — but also your safety net. A clean, controlled rollout can be the difference between a smooth go-live and a 2 a.m. incident call.\n## 5. Monitor Like You Test\nTesting and monitoring go hand in hand. You can't fix what you're not watching. If your SIEM/Log Aggregator flags a CPU spike, it could point to a bad config buried in your IaC. Catch it early; act fast.\n  * Continuously monitor your infrastructure for unauthorized changes or unusual behavior — this is where you catch what testing might miss.\n  * Set up alerts that are actionable, not overwhelming.\n  * Have a tested, ready-to-roll incident response plan before things go sideways.\n  * Establish a formal change management process to preempt issues before they hit production — being proactive here reduces fire drills later.\n\n\nRelated:[Getting Outlook.com Ready for Bulk Email Compliance](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/getting-outlook-com-ready-bulk-email-compliance)\n## 6. Clean Up When You're Done\nIn 2024, several [forgotten subdomains](https://labs.guard.io/subdomailing-thousands-of-hijacked-major-brand-subdomains-found-bombarding-users-with-millions-a5e5fb892935) belonging to Fortune 500 companies and media outlets were hijacked and used to serve malicious content. The cause? Infrastructure had been taken offline, but the subdomain was never properly decommissioned. Incidents like this highlight why proper cleanup isn't optional — it's a critical part of your security posture.\n  * Inventory and document your assets. Sure, it's not glamorous — and definitely easier said than done — but it's essential, especially to stay ahead of sprawl and shadow IT. Knowing what exists is the first step to securing it.\n  * Remove outdated scripts, unused subdomains, and obsolete IAM roles. These forgotten pieces of infrastructure often become low-hanging fruit for attackers — cleaning them up is a simple yet powerful defense.\n  * Check for any lingering dependencies.\n\n\n## 7. Use AI — but Keep It in Check\nAI can boost your cloud security, but only if you're steering the wheel. In 2024, a [Capgemini Research Institute](http:// https://www.capgemini.com/insights/research-library/generative-ai-in-cybersecurity/) survey showed that 61% of the organizations believe AI is effective in threat response and overall security. That's a recipe for problems.\n  * Use AI-powered CSPM/SSPM tools to monitor configs.\n  * Automate scans and spot anomalies.\n  * Always review what AI flags — don't rely blindly.\n  * Keep rules and models up to date.\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\nIaC is powerful. It brings speed, scale, and structure to cloud infrastructure. But none of that matters if your security can't keep up. So plan smart. Test like you mean it. Monitor constantly. Use AI as a co-pilot, not a driver.\nHappy building — and stay secure!\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jatin-mannepalli)\n[Jatin Mannepalli](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jatin-mannepalli)\nInformation Security Officer, IMC Trading\nJatin Mannepalli, CISSP, CCSP is an information security officer (ISO) at IMC Trading, where he brings a deep commitment to managing security and risk across organizations.

The vulnerability is present in versions 11.38.0 to 11.38.19 of Commvault Command Center for Windows and Linux.\nCommvault disclosed the vulnerability on April 17 after researchers at [watchTowr reported the issue](https://labs.watchtowr.com/fire-in-the-hole-were-breaching-the-vault-commvault-remote-code-execution-cve-2025-34028/) to the company. [Commvault warned](https://documentation.commvault.com/securityadvisories/CV_2025_04_1.html?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) of the vulnerability allowing attackers to completely compromise Command Center environments and said it had resolved the issue in versions 11.38.20 and 11.38.25.\nHowever, an exploit that watchTowr developed for CVE-2025-34028 still works in both fixed builds of the software, according to noted security researcher Will Dorman. In a [social media post](https://infosec.exchange/@wdormann/114458913006792356), Dormann said he had run the exploit code against 11.38.25 and found it worked, just as watchTowr had earlier found the proof of concert (PoC) to also work against 11.38.20, the other supposedly fixed version. \"So, I don't believe Commvault's statement that 11.38.25 fixes the vulnerability that watchTowr found in 11.38.20.\nRelated:['Lemon Sandstorm' Underscores Risks to Middle East Infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/lemon-sandstorm-risks-middle-east-infrastructure)\nDormann also wondered why Commvault might issue two updates for a single flaw. \"Commvault claims that 11.38.20 and11.38.25 fixes the watchTowr-reported CVE-2025-34028 vulnerability,\" he wrote in the post. \"(Aside: how is it even possible that two different versions in the same product line are the ones that fix a single vulnerability)?\"\nCommvault did not respond to a Dark Reading request for comment on Dormann's claim.\n## Max Severity Threat\nCVE-025-34028, which has a maximum possible score of 10.00 on the CVSS severity rating scale, is a pre-authentication SSRF vulnerability in Commvault Command Center. Such vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to coerce the server into making arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external systems. The proof of concept exploit code that watchTowr developed, for instance, forced a vulnerable Commvault Command Center instance to fetch a zip file containing a Web shell from an external server and then triggering it.\nSecurity researchers consider such flaws as relatively easy for attackers to exploit and particularly dangerous in the case of software from companies like Commvault, which provides backup, recovery, cloud storage, and associated technologies. Commvault's customers include several large enterprises including Astra Zeneca, 3M, ADP, Sony, ING, and Deloitte.\nRelated:[Play Ransomware Group Used Windows Zero-Day](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/play-ransomware-group-windows-zero-day)\n\"Commvault is heavily embedded in environments where backup integrity is the last line of defense against ransomware,\" says Heath Renfrow, chief information security officer (CISO) and co-founder at Fenix24. \"If this flaw remains exploitable, it jeopardizes recovery capabilities, exposes sensitive archives, and could allow attackers to implant persistent backdoors directly into backup infrastructure.\"\nCommvault has said that customers don't need to take manual action to install the updated software, as updates are applied automatically. However, in cases where immediate installation isn’t feasible, the company recommends isolating affected Command Center instances as a precautionary measure.\nRenfrow says affected organizations should also restrict access to the Command Center UI, audit for indicators of compromise, and consider network-level segmentation or isolation of backup management interfaces. Organizations should also demand clarity from Commvault on the scope and completeness of the patch. \"Transparency here is non-negotiable when the stakes are this high,\" he says.\nRelated:[UK Retailers Reeling From Likely Ransomware Attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/uk-retailers-reeling-ransomware-attacks)\n\"CVE-2025-34028 is deeply concerning — not only because of the technical exploit chain that enables unauthenticated remote code execution, but also due to the growing evidence that the issue may not be fully mitigated, even in patched versions,\" he notes.\" If security researchers like Will Dormann are finding the exploit still works post-remediation, that signals a critical gap in Commvault’s validation process and leaves thousands of organizations with a false sense of security.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a798d4d2c5cdc2c4d39af5c2d4c2c6d5c4cfc2d587f4c6ded487f7c6d3c4cfc2c387e4c8cacad1c6d2cbd387e5d2c087f4d3cecbcb87e2dfd7cbc8ced3c6c5cbc281c6cad79cc5c8c3de9aee829597d3cfc8d2c0cfd3829597d3cfc2829597c1c8cbcbc8d0cec9c0829597c1d5c8ca829597e3c6d5cc829597f5c2c6c3cec9c0829597cacec0cfd3829597cec9d3c2d5c2d4d3829597dec8d2898297e38297e68297e38297e6829597f5c2d4c2c6d5c4cfc2d5829597f4c6ded4829597f7c6d3c4cfc2c3829597e4c8cacad1c6d2cbd3829597e5d2c0829597f4d3cecbcb829597e2dfd7cbc8ced3c6c5cbc28297e38297e6cfd3d3d7d48294e68295e18295e1d0d0d089c3c6d5ccd5c2c6c3cec9c089c4c8ca8295e1c4dec5c2d5c6d3d3c6c4ccd48ac3c6d3c68ac5d5c2c6c4cfc2d48295e1d5c2d4c2c6d5c4cfc2d58ad7c6d3c4cfc2c38ac4c8cacad1c6d2cbd38ac5d2c08ac2dfd7cbc8ced3c6c5cbc2)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\n[Jai Vijayan, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

The vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-3248](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3248), is described as a missing authentication flaw that allows remote attackers to compromise Langflow servers.\nWith a CVSS score of 9.8, the vulnerability is considered critical and threatens Langflow versions prior to 1.3.0, which are susceptible to [code injection](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/apple-cocoapods-bugs-expose-apps-code-injection) in the /api/v1/validate/code endpoint.\nResearchers have found that the endpoint improperly invokes Python's built-in exec() function on user-supplied code without performing adequate authentication, ultimately allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\nVersion 1.3.0 of Langflow was released only at the end of March 2025, and though it mentions several other fixes, according to researchers at SANS Technology Institute's Internet Storm Center, there are no mentions of a major vulnerability requiring fixing.\n\"The vulnerability went somewhat unnoticed, at least by me, until Horizon3 created a detailed writeup showing how easy it is to exploit the vulnerability and provide proof of concept exploit,\" [said Johannes Ullrich](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Exploit+Attempts+for+Recent+Langflow+AI+Vulnerability+CVE20253248/31850), dean of research at SANS Technology Institute, in a post last month detailing the vulnerability's exploit attempts. \"Horizon3 published its blog on April 9th. We saw a first hit to the vulnerable URL, \"[/api/v1/validate/code](https://isc.sans.edu/weblogs/urlhistory.html?url=L2FwaS92MS92YWxpZGF0ZS9jb2Rl)\", on April 10th. Today (April 12th), we saw a significant increase in hits for this URL.\"\n[Horizon3.ai](https://horizon3.ai/attack-research/disclosures/unsafe-at-any-speed-abusing-python-exec-for-unauth-rce-in-langflow-ai/), which discovered the flaw, said CVE-2025-3248 is \"easily exploitable\" and noted that while the patch applies an authentication requirement, the vulnerability still can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges from a regular user to a Langflow superuser. Horizon3.ai encouraged users to update to the latest Langflow version to mitigate against potential exploitation and to refrain from \"exposing any recently developed AI tools to the Internet.\"\nRead more about:\n[News Briefs](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/news-briefs)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\n[Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

They can be exploited remotely to inject OS commands and map URLs to file system locations.\nSonicWall vulnerabilities are popular targets for a variety of threat actors. In January, CISA warned [another vulnerability](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sonicwall-hackers-vulnerability-sma-1000/738333/) affecting SonicWall SMA devices, tracked as [CVE-2025-23006](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23006), was under attack.\nAccording to researchers at WatchTowr, CVE-2023-44221, which was given a CVSS score of 7.2, is an Apache HTTP pre-authentication arbitrary file read, and CVE-2024-38475, with a CVSS score of 9.8, is a post-authentication [command injection](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/cisa-fbi-warn-of-os-command-injection-vulnerabilities).\nPatches have been available for both bugs since 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, SonicWall last week updated its advisories to note the two vulnerabilities are \"potentially\" under exploitation in the wild, which could ultimately lead to attackers accessing certain files and hijacking user sessions. CISA is now stressing the importance of federal agencies patching the vulnerabilities by May 22.\nThe urgency is only heightened since WatchTowr Labs published [technical details](https://labs.watchtowr.com/sonicboom-from-stolen-tokens-to-remote-shells-sonicwall-sma100-cve-2023-44221-cve-2024-38475/) on May 2 for the flaws as well as insights into the exploitation activity. \"Over the last few months, our client base has fed us rumours of in-the-wild exploitation of SonicWall systems, and thus, this topic has had our attention for a while,\" according to the WatchTowr blog post.\n[SonicWall](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/akira-ransomware-actors-exploit-sonicwall-bug-for-rce) is urging its customers to review their SMA devices to ensure that there are no current unauthorized logins.\nRead more about:\n[News Briefs](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/news-briefs)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\n[Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Kristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/kristinabeek)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Their classrooms, student housing, athletics facilities and venues, retail locations, and, in some cases, public safety and clinical locations are all connected to the same network, creating a large and complex landscape for potential attacks.\nThe many points of engagement in higher education institutions result in the collection and storage of large volumes of sensitive information that often are housed in disparate systems, creating many vectors of attack. Threat actors also know some higher education institutions collect more personally identifiable information (PII), like Social Security numbers, than what's necessary, increasing the potential sale value of the data. \nAttacks on these institutions also impact a higher variety of stakeholders compared to many other organizations. Students, parents, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, sports fans, and patients are all potential victims with [unique data that can be stolen](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/education-industry-data-must-be-protected).\nTo better defend against cyber adversaries, higher education security leaders must gain visibility to all the information assets across the distributed areas to address the threats facing their institutions. From there, they can begin to make actionable, informed steps toward fortifying their security landscapes.\nRelated:[How Security Has Changed the Hacker Marketplace](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/how-security-changed-hacker-marketplace)\n## Top Threats to Higher Education Institutions\nWhile higher education institutions are subject to a [variety of types of cyberattacks](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/byod-qr-codes-education-attacks), there are several kinds of incidents that are more commonly experienced: ransomware, insider risks, and phishing and spear phishing. \n### Ransomware\nFor universities without cyber-incident insurance or who don't have the funds to pay the ransom, a ransomware attack could lead to mid- to long-term outages that impact crucial services throughout the institution, including teaching and learning, research, and essential university operations. An unpaid ransom could also mean permanent data loss or the sale of sensitive information to other threat actors.\n### Insider risks\nUnlike other organizations where network users work from business-issued devices, there are a wide variety and volume of people within higher education institutions who have legitimate access to school systems, [often from their personal computers](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/byod-qr-codes-education-attacks) without direct IT oversight. This lack of visibility across all connected devices creates unintentional security gaps that are ripe for hackers to exploit. As a result, even well-intentioned students, faculty, staff, or other members of the campus community can unknowingly allow a major cyber incident.\nRelated:[Life Without CVEs? It's Time to Act](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/life-without-cves-time-act)\n### Phishing and spear phishing\nDuring a phishing campaign, attackers send fraudulent emails or texts to deceive victims into revealing confidential data or installing malware onto their devices, such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Spear-phishing takes this a step further by attempting to convince a targeted user — particularly someone with elevated privileges — that they're communicating with a verified sender. Given the high number of distributed departments within higher education institutions, it can be difficult for students or faculty to determine the legitimacy of emails or texts. Additionally, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasing the volume and efficacy of phishing campaigns, these deceitful communications are ever more difficult to spot and avoid.\n## Challenges in Addressing Higher Education Cyber Threats\nFor many institutions, budgets for information security have decreased, affecting the allocation of necessary resources and staff. This is problematic for the safety and longevity of campus networks, data, and applications. Many small to medium-sized colleges and universities have the same portfolio of applications and systems to protect as larger institutions, but they typically have budgets that are grossly inadequate to protect against threats. \nRelated:[AI Agents Fail in Novel Ways, Put Businesses at Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-agents-fail-novel-put-businesses-at-risk)\nIn addition to shrinking budgets and resources, higher education IT/security teams must also navigate heavily siloed and autonomous organizations and departments. These challenges often leave IT teams struggling to monitor each institutional unit, making it easy for threats to slip through the cracks undetected until it's too late.\nHigher education serves many personas, and sometimes, these personas overlap. For example, students may also be employees, parents of other students, or donors to their respective universities. It's critical for cybersecurity teams to have mature identity and access management (IAM) policies and tools to adequately determine the assets each persona should be able to access.\nAs attacks increase in volume and speed, higher education chief information security officers (CISOs) must be given influence in funding decisions to help ensure they have the resources needed to prevent otherwise avoidable cyber incidents.\n## Best Practices for Higher Education Security Leaders\nTo mitigate these challenges and better protect and defend against potential cyber incidents, higher education institution security leaders must first analyze their full attack surface to develop a strong security strategy and robust internal policies. IT leaders should start with a maturity assessment, identify security gaps, and then develop a roadmap to address them. This plan should be communicated appropriately across the organization, particularly with school administration and leadership.\nFrom there, IT teams should take a risk-based approach, ranking potential threats and acting according to priority. As part of this approach, higher education CISOs must develop a strong inventory of all assets and data and a comprehensive understanding of their risks. IT teams can't protect what they can't see, making increased visibility across the whole campus network key.\nEven still, security leaders are unlikely to have eyes on every area of their organization. It's therefore paramount that higher education institutions invest in security education across departments to ensure that everyone understands their role in avoiding a cyberattack. This is especially important as students integrate their own tools into the network, introducing potentially insecure or malicious tools that could affect the wider institution. Awareness campaigns and training throughout the year can help ensure that all stakeholders have the practical skills and knowledge to make themselves accountable for helping the institution maintain the best security posture. \nAttacks on higher education institutions will only accelerate, especially as hackers continue to become more sophisticated. To keep up, security leaders must act to gain visibility across their entire institution's network and systems and continuously educate their users on best practices. These are not easy tasks, and they are frequently met with many headwinds, so it is important to prioritize the actions that have the most impact in reducing security risks.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/michael-sink)\n[Michael Sink](https://www.darkreading.com/author/michael-sink)\nChief Technology Adviser, Higher Education, World Wide Technology\nMichael Sink serves as chief technology adviser (CTO), higher education, at World Wide Technology (WWT).

To reflect on the past week, we share their responses below, which, perhaps unsurprisingly, focused in large part on the AI-in-security phenomenon.\n##### Andrew Borene\nAndrew \"Swede\" Borene, executive director, international markets and global security, at Flashpoint, was most interested in hearing about how human factors were being brought to the forefront of information security with the rise of AI.\n##### Tony Anscombe\nTony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at ESET, was most looking forward to hearing about the latest innovations when it comes to AI and how cybersecurity professionals are combating the attackers who utilize AI in their malicious practices.\n#### Allison Wikoff\nAllison WIkoff, PwC director and Americas lead for global threat intelligence, invited Dark Reading to PwC's San Francisco offices, where she shared with us that the topics she and her team have been focused on this past year, mainly revolving around what threat actors are up to.\nRelated:[Infrastructure as Code: An IaC Guide to Cloud Security](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/infrastructure-code-iac-guide-cloud-security)\n##### Ira Winkler\nIra Winkler, chief information security officer (CISO) at CYE, noted that connecting with old friends, meeting new ones, and in general relishing in the cybercommunity in person defines the conference for him, which otherwise, he said, is a leopard that doesn't really change its spots from year to year.\n##### Derek Manky\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence at Fortinet, shared that this was the 15th RSAC conference that he has attended and has noticed many changes throughout the years. A big theme this year, he said, was AI — not just buzzy large language models (LLMs) that organizations are implementing but also understanding how to incorporate AI into security solutions.\n##### Michael DeBolt\nMichael DeBolt, chief intel officer at Intel471, was most interested in being a part of conversations revolving around behavior-based threat hunting; he also looked forward to heading out to the show floor to check out the latest products that vendors were showcasing.\n##### RSAC Expo\nDark Reading also took some time to make our way down to the expo floor, where hundreds of vendors were offering games to play, prizes to win, and talks about their latest findings. Our editorial team even came across magic trick demonstrations, an interactive car racing video game, and baby goats — all in the name of cybersecurity.\nRelated:[SANS Top 5: Cyber Has Busted Out of the SOC](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/sans-top5-cyber-broken-out-soc)\n##### Leo Scott\nLeo Scott, chief innovation officer at DataTribe, highlighted RSAC's Innovation Sandbox competition, which seeks to put a spotlight on the cutting edge in the field of cybersecurity. Many of the companies involved in the competition were working on identity-oriented problems in relation to AI, Scott noted.\n##### Chester Wisniewski\nChester Wisniewski, director and global field CISO at Sophos, noted that one of the most pivotal aspects of RSAC is meeting with fellow cybersecurity peers to discuss the issues they're facing while trying to secure their companies. In fact, the theme of this year's conference was \"community,\" which was highlighted in Hugh Thompson's \"The Power of Community\" keynote address.\n##### Marcus Fowler\nMarcus Fowler, CEO of Darktrace Federal, shared several things that he loved hearing about and participating in, including the RSAC public sector day and its speakers. Key topics this year included developing a stronger cybersecurity workforce, understanding the impact of AI, and improving the exchange of information between government entities. The keynote speaker this year was Gurpreet Bhatia, acting deputy Department of Defense chief information officer for cybersecurity & acting CISO, who discussed the future of cybersecurity and the need for zero-trust frameworks.\nRelated:[Getting Outlook.com Ready for Bulk Email Compliance](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/getting-outlook-com-ready-bulk-email-compliance)\n##### Tim Mackey\nTim Mackey, head of software supply chain risk strategy at BlackDuck, continued on the AI train, sharing that it was unsurprisingly this year's biggest theme due to what it can provide users and organizations. The more pressing matter, he said, is now trying to figure out which ones work, and which ones don't.\n##### Tim Boettcher\nTim Boettcher, senior vice president and head of go-to-market strategy at AvePoint, highlighted learning about [agentic AI](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/terra-security-automates-penetration-testing-agentic-ai) and the impact this has on data security. Up to this point, generative AI has hogged the spotlight, but next-gen agentic AI is quickly gaining popularity as organizations expand their use of AI. The latter is even more autonomous than its predecessors — which may be seen as an advantage to some but comes with its own risks.\n##### Jon France\nJon France added to Boettcher's sentiments, noting that this year's conference was actually all about the new wave of agentic AI.

As Arctic Wolf Labs explained in a [May 2 blog post](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/venom-spider-uses-server-side-polymorphism-to-weave-a-web-around-victims/), employees responsible for the hiring process can be some of the most vulnerable in these kinds of cyberattacks.\n\"The recruiters and hiring managers who work in HR departments are often considered to be the weak point in an organization by attackers, as the very nature of their job means that they must regularly open email attachments (e.g.: resumes and cover letters) emailed to them from external and unknown sources, including job candidates and hiring agencies,\" the blog post read.\nThe research details [Venom Spider](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/venom-spider-malware-maas-platform), a financially motivated threat actor that applies for real jobs using fake résumés. The emails it sends contain files that, when downloaded, drop a multipurpose backdoor named [\"More_eggs.\"](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/attackers-targeting-recruiters-more_eggs-backdoor)\n## How Venom Spider Targets Its Prey\nVenom Spider has been active for several years, with activities dating at least as far back as the late 2010s. ProofPoint published research [in early 2019](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-delivering-moreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers) detailing how the More_eggs backdoor was used as far back as mid-2018.\nRelated:[Email-Based Attacks Top Cyber-Insurance Claims](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/email-based-attacks-cyber-insurance-claims)\nIn that campaign, Venom Spider posted fake jobs and contacted users through LinkedIn's direct messaging service. The threat actor would distribute payloads via fake staffing websites as well as malicious attachments.\nIn its most recent activity detailed by Arctic Wolf, Venom Spider has been sending spear-phishing emails to corporate recruiters or hiring managers. The message contains a link to an external site, which includes a captcha box (used to bypass automatic scanners). Once the victim passes the captcha check, a zip file is downloaded \"which the recruiter is lead to believe is the candidate’s resume.\"\nThe zip file instead contains a \"g.jpg\" image file — a \"distraction,\" according to Arctic Wolf — as well as a malicious Windows shortcut, or .Ink file, that acts as the payload for the first stage of the attack.\nThe .Ink file downloads a .bat file from attacker infrastructure. The .bat file in turn opens WordPad (to trick the employee into thinking a real file is being accessed) while covertly launching legitimate Windows application \"ie4uinit.exe\" to execute commands and run JavaScript code.\nAs part of all this, the malicious code creates an executable library known as \"More_eggs_Dropper.\"\nRelated:[A Cybersecurity Paradox: Even Resilient Organizations Are Blind to AI Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/even-resilient-organizations-bind-ai-threats)\n\"The More_eggs_Dropper executable library is complex, utilizing obfuscated code that generates JavaScript code polymorphically. Execution of the library is time-delayed to evade sandboxing and analysis by researchers,\" Arctic Wolf said. \"More_eggs_Dropper creates a legitimate Windows msxsl.exe executable to run XML files that may also contain JavaScript code. This technique is known to have been used by Venom Spider in previous campaigns.\"\nSimilarly, the initial .Ink file is generated polymorphically, meaning a new file is downloaded each time from the attacker's server, with different obfuscation and file size.\nMore_eggs_Dropper creates a JavaScript launcher, a JavaScript payload, and an executable to run XML files. Its payloads ultimately lead to the execution More_eggs, the primary payload in the attack chain. The backdoor collects victims' system information and communicates with a command-and-control (C2) server. Finally, More_eggs is used to \"run additional JavaScript code or executable files on the victim’s system.\"\nArctic Wolf said Venom Spider has been conducting these attacks since at least October 2023.\n## How Defenders Can Protect Themselves\nAlthough there is plenty to be said about the complex nature of Venom Spider's campaign, it ultimately is just another phishing campaign at the end of the day.

The ransomware landscape has expanded as well, with more initial access brokers who provide gangs with an entrance to their targeted victims.\nThe [influx of identity threats](https://www.darkreading.com/identity-access-management-security/even-orgs-with-sso-are-vulnerable-to-identity-based-attacks) sparked a passwordless push over the past few years. Passkeys are one option that are growing in popularity. Unlike passwords, passkeys don't depend on shared secrets that can be leaked in data breaches. That's because the data is stored on the device directly. They are phishing-resistant, which is another big draw — especially as attackers use artificial intelligence (AI) to [improve phishing techniques](https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/phishing-kit-darcula-gets-major-ai-upgrade).\nPasskeys have a grand vision to replace passwords and may be the solution to the passwordless future, said Fei Liu, senior emerging tech researcher at Okta, at [RSAC Conference 2025](https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us25/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1727064797552001VsGs). However, like any new technology, implementation is full of obstacles.\n\"The passkey ecosystem is flourishing. Conceptually, passkeys have enormous potential benefits,\" Liu said, noting that even he encountered challenges getting started.\nRelated:[How DigitalOcean Moved Away From Manual Identity Management](https://www.darkreading.com/identity-access-management-security/how-digitalocean-moved-away-from-manual-identity-management)\n## Cross-Platform Inconsistencies\nAs of now, users can't use passkeys consistently across platforms. The inconsistent passkey login experience is one area that requires significant improvement to motivate password adoption.\n\"We're still at the very beginning of the implementation journey, even for first-party platform providers,\" she said. \"Second, all providers have a strong incentive to let their users save their passkeys in their ecosystems and tailor implementations to leverage their ecosystem assets.\"\nDevelopers have to [understand the cross-platform disparities](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/new-developer-tools-necessary-passkey-adoption) — such as Google developers using Chrome and Android and Apple developers using iOS — and stay up to date with all provider updates, she stated. \n\"For users, it's really hard, if not impossible, to understand which passkey can be used for operating system and browser combinations, whether they need to log into platform providers in order to use their passkeys, or whether they had created any passkeys with any application,\" Liu said.\nThe way users log in to applications also contributes to the usability problem, particularly for beginners. Though many offer a sign-in with passkey option, login boxes typically do not display the option to sign up for a passkey upfront.\nRelated:[Jamf Buys Identity Automation, Expands IAM Capabilities](https://www.darkreading.com/identity-access-management-security/jamf-buys-identity-automation-expands-iam)\n## Ecosystem Favors Platform Providers\nA lack of user consideration is a recurring theme. The influence of the ecosystem players is disproportional to the kinds of players in each category, she warned. Categories include users, application providers, password managers, and platform providers, such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\"The power is concentrated in the hands of platform providers, while the users hold the least power,\" Liu said.\nStill, passkey adoption continues to increase as usability progresses. When users have the right passkeys with the right configuration, almost all applications have succeeded at seamless log-in processes.\n## Plenty of Work Ahead\nProblem-solving is necessary to continue the progress — not only for passkeys but, in general, for authentication. For example, syncing credentials between personal and corporate devices can be dangerous, Liu warned. Additionally, while all platform providers recommend that users turn on MFA, none of them enforce MFA for all customers. Even then, based on her observations, passkeys do not meet MFA requirements in every step.\n\"A large percentage of users only use passwords still to protect accounts,\" she said. \"Weak logins can undermine everything, including passkeys.\"\nRelated:[25 Years On, Active Directory Is Still a Prime Attack Target](https://www.darkreading.com/identity-access-management-security/25-years-active-directory-prime-attack-target)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bd82cec8dfd7d8dec980f2d3dad2d4d3da9deddcceced6d8c49de8cedcdfd4d1d4c9c49dfed5dcd1d1d8d3dad8ce9defd8ccc8d4cfd89d9b9ec58f8a86edcfd2dfd1d8d090eed2d1cbd4d3da9b9ec58f8a869bdcd0cd86dfd2d9c480f4988f8dc9d5d2c8dad5c9988f8dc9d5d8988f8ddbd2d1d1d2cad4d3da988f8ddbcfd2d0988f8df9dccfd6988f8defd8dcd9d4d3da988f8dd0d4dad5c9988f8dd4d3c9d8cfd8cec9988f8dc4d2c893988df9988dfc988df9988dfc988f8df2d3dad2d4d3da988f8deddcceced6d8c4988f8de8cedcdfd4d1d4c9c4988f8dfed5dcd1d1d8d3dad8ce988f8defd8ccc8d4cfd8988f8d9b9ec58f8a86edcfd2dfd1d8d090eed2d1cbd4d3da9b9ec58f8a86988df9988dfcd5c9c9cdce988efc988ffb988ffbcacaca93d9dccfd6cfd8dcd9d4d3da93ded2d0988ffbd4d9d8d3c9d4c9c490dcdeded8cece90d0dcd3dcdad8d0d8d3c990ced8dec8cfd4c9c4988ffbcddcceced6d8c490c8cedcdfd4d1d4c9c490ded5dcd1d1d8d3dad8ce90cfd8ccc8d4cfd890cdcfd2dfd1d8d090ced2d1cbd4d3da)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\n[Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nFeatures Writer , Dark Reading \nArielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.\n[See more from Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

It makes mundane tasks easier to accomplish, speeds up certain processes, and promotes global connections. But the downsides aren't always adequately discussed, including the harmful effect it can have on children, [teenagers](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/tiktok-teen-data-use-probed-regulators), and young adults. The Internet paved the way for anonymity — but it is also the root of many problems. Individuals [abuse anonymity](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/teens-committing-scary-cybercrimes-trend) to bully others, leading to increased self-esteem problems and suicide, particularly in young men.\n\"How did we end up, in the US, with the expectation that you have the right to anonymity?\" asked Richard Bird, CSO at Singulr AI, of [RSAC Conference attendees](https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us25/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1728058704997001QRQa) last week.\nInternet use starts from a younger age now, with even 2-year-olds using Internet-connected devices, Bird said, noting that the shift is an exponential leap in exposure to digital channels and content.\n\"In no aspect of our analog life do you have the right to anonymity but on the Internet,\" Bird said. \"We've built it that way. We've never fixed the problem. It allows for tremendous amounts of bad behavior. Forget the criminal aspects. We designed it this way. We are here because we put ourselves here.\"\nRelated:[NIST Updates Privacy Framework With AI and Governance Revisions](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/nist-updates-privacy-framework-ai-governance)\n## Time to Recognize the Problem\nWhile these concerns aren't new, they continue to worsen. With [suicides increasingly](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/facebook-at-20-contemplating-the-cost-of-privacy) being directly tied to the digital world, it is more important than ever to study the links, Bird emphasized. Suicides have been connected not only to online bullies, but to bots posing as real humans as well.\n\"We can't continue to treat use cases as hypotheticals. Not when we're talking about people's lives,\" Bird said, who called out corporate and security environments for not having enough of these \"taboo\" discussions. \"I think we need to recognize that we have a problem that we are avoiding or ignoring as it relates to the impact of what we provide as a service or what technology is doing relative to impacting children.\"\n## Communication Disparities\nAdditionally, technology has created a larger disconnect between children and parents. Younger generations may communicate through emojis, for example.\n\"All of these different pieces can stack into communication happening between your child, teen, or young adult,\" Bird said. \"We're not even speaking the same language anymore.\"\nTechnology use is also contributing to more unrealistic expectations for younger generations. Becoming influencers who gain online stardom and make millions, both financially and in followers, is one prime example. It represents how expansive the Internet's capabilities are, as well as the culture that now underlies everything, said Xavier Bird, a psychology doctorate candidate at the University of Denver who joined his father on stage at RSAC Conference. Studies have shown that a significant number of high-school students view being influencers as a viable graduation path.\nRelated:[NIST Finalizes Differential Privacy Rules to Protect Data](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/nist-finalizes-differential-privacy-rules-to-protect-data)\n\"I've seen how the fundamental psychology of the Internet user base has changed to fit each era we've stepped into, and they've progressed more and more rapidly,\" the younger Bird said.\nOpen discussions — not only in the industry but between parents and children — are critical to address the rising self-image threats related to Internet use. Taking digital breaks, curating feeds and content, finding positive digital spaces, and asking for help navigating the pitfalls are all important things to do to ensure a safer world.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\n[Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nFeatures Writer , Dark Reading \nArielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.\n[See more from Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Kramer obtained login information that allowed him to illegally download confidential data through the employee's [Slack account](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/slack-ai-patches-bug-that-let-attackers-steal-data-from-private-channels).\nKramer was charged with one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, each of which carry a prison sentence of up to five years. \nIn 2024, a hacker group called NullBulge posted on a hacking forum that it had stolen 1.1TB of data from Disney's internal Slack channels. This prompted Disney to launch an investigation into the matter, which allegedly involved information on unreleased projects as well as source code and login credentials.\nNullBulge claimed to be a Russian [hacktivist group](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/russian-hacktivist-platform-ddosia-grows-exponentially) that was protecting artists' rights and ensuring fair compensation for their work. However, researchers at [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/nullbulge-threat-actor-masquerades-as-hacktivist-group-rebelling-against-ai/) analyzed the threat group's activity and said that its actions contradicted what it claimed.\nKramer distributed malicious code disguised as a tool for creating AI-generated art, which he used to gain access to victims' devices. A Disney employee downloaded the fake AI tool, which allowed Kramer to access their device and, later, access sensitive corporate data.\nKramer attempted to extort the Disney employee and leaked his personal information along with the stolen Disney files when he received no response.\nAfter the data leak was discovered, Disney reportedly stopped using Slack for communications and fired the employee who downloaded the fake AI tool.

As enterprises begin deploying AI agents — software that can take action without human intervention — across their organizations, how can businesses ensure this digital workforce doesn't go rogue?\nOne of the most concerning behaviors we're seeing from AI models comes from studies showing that, every once in a while, AI could go rogue, intentionally deceiving humans. \nWhat's going on here? Is this the beginning of The Terminator? No, it's not due to malice or sentience, but because of conflicting objectives, flawed data, and unintended programming consequences. While these risks are significant, a strategic approach to AI oversight and design can mitigate potential pitfalls.\nAI is here to stay, and its value is undeniable. As organizations embrace the [benefits of AI agents](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/7ai-streamlines-security-operations-with-autonomous-ai-agents), ensuring secure and trusted implementation is more crucial than ever before. \n## Is AI Deception a Reality? Insights From Research\nAccording to a recent [Salesforce survey](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stat-library/all-stats/?q=&role=it) of IT leaders, \"the use of AI — including agents — is already prevalent and expected to increase further over the coming years. At least 79% of IT leaders believe AI agents bring security opportunities and threats.\"\nRelated:[AI Agents Fail in Novel Ways, Put Businesses at Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-agents-fail-novel-put-businesses-at-risk)\nRecently, [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/scheming-reasoning-evaluations) conducted an interesting experiment that sheds some light on how AI models can be induced to lie. The study found that deception often arises when AI systems face conflicting objectives or receive negative feedback for truthful answers. Similarly, [additional research](https://time.com/7202784/ai-research-strategic-lying/) from Anthropic revealed that AI models sometimes demonstrate deceptive tendencies, even showing awareness of their deception on \"scratch pads\" — internal logging mechanisms for the model to chart its \"thought process.\"\nUnderstanding the underlying causes of AI deception is crucial for developing effective countermeasures:\n  * Conflicting objectives: When an AI is given contradictory goals, it may prioritize one over another, leading to deceptive behavior.\n  * Flawed data and governance: Poor-quality data can mislead AI models, causing them to provide inaccurate or misleading responses. Sometimes, AI appears to \"lie\" simply because it is overly confident in flawed information.\n\n\n## Human Oversight Is the Key\nHuman oversight remains essential in AI governance. However, traditional models of oversight — where humans actively supervise AI — must evolve into a \"checking in\" approach. This ensures AI outputs are continuously monitored, reviewed, and refined, reducing the likelihood of AI deviating from intended behavior.\nRelated:[Meta Wins Lawsuit Against Spyware Vendor NSO Group](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/meta-wins-lawsuit-spyware-vendor-nso)\nAs AI autonomy increases, organizations must implement more sophisticated monitoring systems and guardrails to prevent deceptive behavior from going unnoticed.\n## Creating Multifaceted Guardrails, So to Speak\nAccording to a recent survey, [only 11% of chief information officers (CIOs)](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/cio-ai-trends/) have fully implemented AI due to security concerns — like the fear of an AI agent going rogue. \nTo prevent a Skynet from becoming our worst reality, improving governance over your AI agents is critical. Organizations should be ready to deploy a combination of strategic technical and operational strategies that can help you:\n  * Avoid contradictory incentives and ensure honesty is not penalized\n  * Maintain data accuracy, relevance, and secure access controls\n  * Use structured prompts and robust guardrails to guide AI responses\n  * Track AI outputs while considering how feedback mechanisms shape behavior\n  * Implement \"scratch pads\" or logs to trace AI decision-making processes\n  * Clearly indicate when AI encounters conflicting information to promote transparency\n  * Ensure data integrity and availability to prevent misinformation issues\n\n\nRelated:['Bring Your Own Installer' Attack Targets SentinelOne EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/bring-your-own-installer-attack-sentinelone-edr)\nOne of the key takeaways of the Anthropic study is its scratch pad findings. These logs revealed that deception wasn't always an accidental by-product of bad data or conflicting objectives. In some cases, the AI model strategically adjusted its responses to align with expected outcomes and avoid being modified, even when that meant withholding or distorting information.\nThese findings underscore the need for robust monitoring, logging, and ethical AI design. For example, if AI models can recognize and execute deception, then the guardrails we put in place need to prioritize truthfulness, transparency, and accountability, and reinforce ethical AI behavior.\n## We Need to Learn How to Work With AI Agents Safely \nAI agents are here to stay — and their impact is undeniable. Healthcare provider Precina is now automating routine tasks and ensuring 24/7 support with AI agent. Virtual accounting firm 1-800Accountant is using AI agents to resolve 50% of customer inquiries. AI agents will be integrated across industries, so it's important that organizations prioritize guardrails and safe use of them.\nAs AI systems handle increasingly complex tasks, human operators will shift focus from direct oversight to strategic and creative problem-solving. However, to fully leverage AI's potential without unintended consequences, proactive governance measures must be in place. This is not a cause for alarm but a reassurance that we are taking the necessary steps to ensure the responsible use of these powerful tools.\nCollaborative efforts between technologists (developers), ethicists, and regulators will be essential to create frameworks that prevent AI from acting against human interests, ensuring these powerful tools remain beneficial rather than detrimental.\nWe're all going to become massively more effective because we'll have the ability to get things done in minutes that used to take us weeks or months. AI agents might even benefit us from a security perspective. In [Salesforce's survey](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stat-library/all-stats/?q=&role=it) of IT leaders, 100% of security leaders believe AI agents can improve at least one security concern.\nAI models require structured inputs, feedback mechanisms, and guardrails to perform reliably and ethically. When designed with strong governance principles, AI can drive innovation while maintaining the people's trust and security, leaving the Skynets of the world remaining just a name in a movie starring a man named Arnold.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/marla-hay)\n[Marla Hay](https://www.darkreading.com/author/marla-hay)\nVice President of Product Management for Security, Privacy, and Data Protection, Salesforce\nMarla Hay is the vice president of product management for security, privacy, and data protection at Salesforce.

NCSC CEO Dr. Richard Horne said in an included statement that the agency was working with affected organizations and that “these incidents should act as a wake-up call to all organizations.\"\nCo-Op, [Marks & Spencer](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/marks-spencer-cyber-incident), and Harrods are among the retailers that have confirmed attacks in recent weeks. In an article published May 2, [Bloomberg News reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/-dragonforce-hacking-gang-takes-credit-for-uk-retail-attacks) a spokesperson for the DragonForce ransomware gang — a group that emerged as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) player in 2023 — took credit for the attacks against all three retailers.\nLast month, researchers from Sophos' Secureworks reported that [DragonForce had an RaaS model ](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/ransomware-gangs-innovate-new-affiliate-models)where affiliates could create their own \"brand,\" using DragonForce's ransomware or using their own tools for extortion attacks.\nOthers have speculated that Scattered Spider, a high-profile ransomware group that [has apparently continued its activities](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/despite-arrests-scattered-spider-continues-hacking) despite a series of [arrests](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/scattered-spider-boss-cuffed), could be behind the attacks. Bleeping Computer reported earlier this week that Scattered Spider hackers deployed DragonForce ransomware against Marks & Spencer. Security vendor Silent Push said in a recent newsletter that Scattered Spider was \"likely\" behind all three retailer attacks.\nRelated:['Lemon Sandstorm' Underscores Risks to Middle East Infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/lemon-sandstorm-risks-middle-east-infrastructure)\nMeanwhile, Google's Threat Intelligence Group acknowledged that the group was active again but added they did not have enough data to make conclusive attribution.\n\"The group known as Scattered Spider is somewhat amorphous. Actors pass in and out, and the associations aren't extremely firm. That can make it hard to do attribution and it can make it hard to completely put a stop to their activity,\" John Hultquist, chief analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading. \"Historically these actors have gone after sectors in waves and the trend in UK retail shouldn't be ignored.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\n[Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nDark Reading\nAlex is a writer, journalist, and podcaster based in Boston.\n[See more from Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Now all but the tiniest banks, lenders, insurers, and [related service providers](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/ukraine-gaza-wars-ddos-surge-finservs) with any sort of presence in the finance capital of the world will need to have implemented a slate of standard cybersecurity hygiene measures aimed at protecting companies from financially motivated threat actors.\nEven after all these years — and the amendments and deadlines they brought — there remains disagreement about whether the rules are perfectly just or unnecessarily heavy handed.\n\"Companies seem to be working hard to make sense of these rules and apply them as best they can,\" says Kirk J. Nahra, partner at WilmerHale. \"I am concerned that this is too problematic and overly prescriptive for many companies. It's not that these kinds of provisions aren't things that companies should be evaluating, but this feels very 'gotcha' for after-the-fact reviews.\"\n## What to Know About 23 NYCRR Part 500\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\nThe deadline for complying with 23 NYCRR Part 500 has been split six ways, to more gradually ease companies through the process. The first deadline, on Dec. 1, 2023, introduced the requirement that regulated entities [report any potentially materially harmful cybersecurity events](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/hackers-weaponize-sec-disclosure-rules-against-corporate-targets) — most notably [ransomware attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/fbi-closes-in-scattered-spider-attacks-finance-insurance-orgs) — to NYDFS.\nWith two other deadlines in April 2024, companies were required to begin annual cybersecurity audits, awareness training for employees, penetration testing, and more. Annual compliance filings were now required, and had to be signed by a chief information security officer (CISO). Sabeen Malik, vice president of global government affairs and public policy at Rapid7, makes note that \"other [similar] regulations say you should have a senior leader. The fact that this does explicitly ask that you appoint a CISO is interesting.\"\nAnother deadline on Nov. 1, 2024, brought an added set of responsibilities around data encryption, incident response, disaster recovery, and the responsibilities of the CISO and other senior leaders.\nThis latest May 1 deadline focuses most notably on access controls: implementing a privileged access management (PAM) solution, configuring remote control protocols, and removing old and unused accounts. It also requires that companies perform basic password hygiene checks, conduct vulnerability scans, and implement solutions for malware detection, event logging, and [endpoint detection and response (EDR)](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/security-end-run-aukill-shuts-down-windows-reliant-edr-processes).\nRelated:[TikTok Fined €530 Million Over Chinese Access to EU Data](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/tiktok-fined-530-million-eu-data-servers-china)\nThe final deadline will occur on Nov. 1, 2025, by which point finance companies operating in New York will have to have produced complete asset inventories of their IT systems, and implemented broad multifactor authentication (MFA) for all employees accessing those systems.\n## Are the Rules Too Strict?\nThough it might sound like a lot in sum, Malik emphasizes that \"companies should be doing all of that anyway. If the lights went off, if our assets stopped working, if something was to happen where our [data would be hijacked](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/-money-lover-finance-app-exposes-user-data) or exfiltrated, what are we going to do? At the stage that we're at, for mid- to large companies, that should just be part of your business [strategy].\"\nIn fact, she adds, the regulations in some ways could have gone further. \"I feel like they could have addressed a little bit more about open source software (OSS) dependencies,\" Malik says.\nWilmerHale's Nahra takes a more cautious view. He recalls that \"when cybersecurity legal requirements first began, all regulators recognized that not every company was the same and that dictating specific detailed requirements would both mean that different kinds of companies would have to follow the same principles and that the kinds of technologies would need to be updated on a very frequent basis. This was an approach that focused on appropriate processes rather than specific technical details.\"\nRelated:[Experts Debate Real ID Security Ahead of May 7 Deadline](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/experts-real-id-security-may-7-deadline)\nNow, he says, some regulators are moving away from that approach, referring in particular to NYDFS. For companies, more-than-averagely-prescriptive regulations leave less room for confusion, but also introduce more opportunities for penalties later down the line. \"I hope that the regulators will look at approaches and processes and not after the fact nitpick details about how specific incidents could have had a different result if only some specific thing could have been done,\" Nahra says.\nMalik thinks finance companies can handle it. \"Remember: this body and these regulations are geared toward industries that are more or less used to that level of stringency when it comes to instituting compliance frameworks,\" she says. And in general, cyber or otherwise \"when it comes to risk, the financial industry is always ahead of everybody else.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\n[Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

While such scanning is typically constant and low-volume, the company detected four significant spikes over the past six months, each involving at least 2,900 unique IP addresses.\nThe April spike was the biggest yet, however, involving nearly 4,800 IP addresses, says Bob Rudis, vice president of data science for GreyNoise Intelligence.\n\"We're not seeing a massive daily focus on developer-oriented things — it is still sporadic, it is still intermittent, and it just bursts every once in a while,\" he says. \"Yet, there's that steady stream of somebody always looking for ENV, and there's always somebody looking for the Git files as well.\"\nThe attention to developers is warranted. In 2024, GitHub scanning found [more than 39 million development secrets](https://github.blog/security/application-security/next-evolution-github-advanced-security/) that had been leaked to online repositories, while secrets-management firm GitGuardian discovered nearly 24 million secrets publicly committed to GitHub during the year, more than doubling [the 10 million secrets leaked in 2022](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/inside-threat-developers-leaked-10m-credentials-passwords-2022). About two-thirds of all leaked secrets (65%) appeared in the environment-variable configuration files, [according to GitGuardian's latest report](https://www.gitguardian.com/state-of-secrets-sprawl-report-2025).\nRelated:['CoGUI' Phishing Kit Helps Chinese Hackers Target Japan](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cogui-phishing-kit-chinese-hackers-japan)\nEnvironment, Git, and EC2 configuration files are the top targets of attackers' scans. Source: GreyNoise Intelligence\nA leaked development secret can have widespread and potentially dire impact, says Jennifer Schelkopf, director of product management at GitHub.\n\"When secrets like API keys, tokens, or credentials are exposed in code, attackers don't just gain access to the specific resources those secrets unlock — they often use that initial access as a foothold to move laterally through connected systems, potentially compromising entire organizations,\" she says.\n## Leaking Secrets Is Too Easy\nMore people are jumping into the development of Web applications, and many have not had adequate training. In addition, early adopters of AI pair programming have led to the advent of \"vibe coding,\" where enthusiastic — but untrained — developers use code-generating chatbots to create workable but brittle applications.\nBecause these coders do not have experience with best practices, they will push all their code during deployment, including configuration files, GreyNoise's Rudis says.\nRelated:[CISA Warns 2 SonicWall Vulnerabilities Under Active Exploitation](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/two-sonicwall-vulnerabilities-under-exploitation)\n\"It's really easy for people to make this mistake — when you want to deploy an application, you're supposed to only deploy the thing you've built, and a lot of people just deploy the entire development directory to the server,\" he says. \"When you do that, you're literally put the ENV file that has all the secrets and stuff in it for your app right out there with it. You're putting the Git folder out there with all of your code.\"\nOther mistakes are common as well. Developers tend to think that their private repositories are safe, leading to less rigorous security checks, with GitGuardian finding eight times as many secrets leaked in private repositories as public repos. In addition, developers tend not to strictly limit permissions, making the leak of a development configuration file even more impactful.\nNearly 95% of GitHub tokens granted full access, while 58% of GitLab API keys granted full access, which raises the impact of any leaks, says Dwayne McDaniel, a senior developer advocate at GitGuardian.\n\"Those tokens are one of the most common things you would put in a Git folder — it would be a permission for managing your GitHub instance or your GitHub organization,\" he says. \"Developers think, 'This is safe, it's my Git folder, and of course, we're never going to ship that.'\"\nRelated:[Phony Hacktivist Pleads Guilty to Disney Data Leak](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/phony-hacktivist-pleads-guilty-disney-leak)\n## Attackers Got Git Good\nWhen they are shipped, however, attackers will quickly find the mistakes. The latest scans for Git configuration files detected by GreyNoise Intelligence come from the IP address space of major cloud providers — such as Amazon, Cloudflare, and DigitalOcean — in Singapore and the United States. The attackers scanned targets in those two countries as well as Germany, the United Kingdom, and India, [the company stated in its report](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/spike-git-configuration-crawling-risk-codebase-exposure).\n\"In some cases, if the full .git directory is also exposed, attackers may be able to reconstruct the entire codebase — including commit history, which may contain confidential information, credentials, or sensitive logic,\" the company stated.\nGitHub is focused on blunting such attacks, adding a variety of security controls to the development pipeline. The company rolled out Push Protection for free to all public repositories in 2024, catching 4.4 million leaked secrets during the year. GitHub continues to expand both the number of different types of secrets they check for and improve the algorithms to catch more variations, such as HTTP headers, database-connection strings, and passwords, Schelkopf says.\n\"Looking ahead, we're investing in expanding both our detection capabilities and the scope of patterns covered by push protection,\" she adds, \"while maintaining our commitment to offering essential protections for free where the risk is highest, public repositories.\"\nSchelkopf recommends that developers run [the free Secret Risk Assessment tool released in April](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-04-find-secrets-in-your-organization-with-the-secret-risk-assessment/) and enable Push Protection on their accounts. In addition, development teams should educate themselves on the issues, use platforms designed to manage secrets, and rotate compromised credentials.\n\"Remember that security is a continuous process,\" she says. \"Even if a private repository seems secure today, a compromised developer account or device could expose those secrets tomorrow.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\n[Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

First emerging in 2022, the group's members displayed a knack for social engineering schemes that allowed them to steal credentials from targeted organizations and gain privileged access into their networks.\nThe threat group — aka UNC3944, Octo Tempest, and Muddled Libra among other names — has frustrated theinformation security community with its resilience.Scattered Spider members are primarily English-speaking teenagers and young adults from the US and United Kingdom, and despite law enforcement agencies [reportedly identifying several suspected hackers](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/scattered-spider-casino-hackers-evade-arrest-in-plain-sight) in late 2023, no arrests or indictments were made until early 2024, when authorities arrested Noah Michael Urban, then 19, in Florida.\nOther suspected members of the cybercriminal group soon followed, including the alleged ringleader of the group, Tyler Buchanan, who was[ arrested in Spain](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/scattered-spider-boss-cuffed). Urban last month pleaded guilty to several charges related to social engineering schemes and cryptocurrency theft tied to Scattered Spider.\nRelated:['Lemon Sandstorm' Underscores Risks to Middle East Infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/lemon-sandstorm-risks-middle-east-infrastructure)\nHowever, the arrests and indictments don't appear to have deterred Scattered Spider. Bleeping Computer this week [reported](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marks-and-spencer-breach-linked-to-scattered-spider-ransomware-attack/) that the cyberattack against British retail giant Marks & Spencer was perpetrated by members of the group using DragonForce ransomware. Earlier this month, threat intelligence vendor Silent Push said it had [observed significant threat activity](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/scattered-spider-2025/), specifically phishing campaigns targeting well-known brands this year, from Chick-fil-A to Louis Vuitton.\n### Scattered Spider Undeterred\nSo why hasn't law enforcement action had the desired effect on Scattered Spider? Aiden Sinnott, security researcher with the counter threat unit at Sophos-owned Secureworks, says the threat group, which it tracks as Gold Harvest, is unlike your typical ransomware operation.\n\"Scattered Spider are a disparate collection of individuals rather than a traditional hierarchical crime group, meaning that 'cutting the head off the snake' and taking down senior members doesn't necessarily have a trickle-down effect on the rest of the group as it would in more structured groups,\" Sinnott says.\nAnd while the group is known for skilled social engineering techniques such as SIM-swapping and multifactor authentication (MFA) bombing, members have frequently shifted to different types of attacks and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups. For example, Sinnott notes the attack on MGM Resorts featured ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware, while other attacks have used RansomHub or simple data-extortion schemes.\nRelated:[Play Ransomware Group Used Windows Zero-Day](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/play-ransomware-group-windows-zero-day)\nIn the most recent attack tied to Scattered Spider, threat actors reportedly used DragonForce ransomware against Marks & Spencer. DragonForce recently shifted to a \"cartel approach,\" Secureworks noted in a [blog post](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ransomware-groups-evolve-affiliate-models) last week, which features a [distributed affiliate model](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/ransomware-gangs-innovate-new-affiliate-models) where hackers can take advantage of various tools and infrastructure, with the option of deploying DragonForce ransomware or committing data-extortion attacks. The offerings include customizable encryption tools that boast built-in evasion capabilities to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) technology as well as extortion services such as call-based tactics to pressure victims, Sinnott said.\nDespite Scattered Spider's persistence and ability to shift gears, all is not lost, according to Sinnott. \"The advantage, however, is that this group are predominantly UK/US-based and English-speaking, meaning there will likely be more opportunities for law enforcement action and intelligence development from forensic analysis of seized devices and potential cooperation of any arrested individuals,\" he says.\nRelated:[Researcher Says Patched Commvault Bug Still Exploitable](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/researcher-patched-commvault-bug-exploitable)\nOnly time will tell if additional arrests put a dent in the group's activity.\nIn the meantime, experts urge organizations to shore up defenses against Scattered Spider-like threats, such as implementing non-SMS-based MFA on all accounts and to be aware of advanced social engineering attacks like MFA bombing attacks. Additionally, Silent Push recommended that organizations identify and block any domains related to Scattered Spider activity, though the company noted this can be difficult. Silent Push said the group has begun using dynamic DNS providers that allow members to register subdomains on a central domain, which makes tracking Scattered Spider infrastructure a more complex task.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-wright)\n[Rob Wright](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-wright)\nSenior News Director, Dark Reading\nRob Wright is a longtime reporter and senior news director for Informa TechTarget's security team.

Cool. Your job might be about to get a lot harder.\nThe current administration is trying to [slash the budget](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/how-cisa-cuts-impact-election-security) and head count for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). You know — the part of the government that helps the rest of us not get wrecked by cyberattacks. If you're thinking, \"That's a government thing; doesn't affect me,\" think again. CISA isn't just a .gov resource. It's the connective tissue between public and private defense. And when that connection weakens, so does everyone's ability to respond to what's coming next.\nThink of CISA like the National Weather Service for cyber threats. They're not the ones boarding up windows, but they provide the early warnings, playbooks, and coordination that let the rest of us act before the storm hits. Now imagine defunding the Weather Service while telling every town to install and monitor its own radar. That's what this budget cut feels like to me. And it could turn into a real mess, real fast.\n## What Actually Breaks When You Cut CISA?\n  * Threat response slows down. Fewer alerts, less coordination, more companies flying solo while attackers work in sync.\n  * Security standards splinter. Without consistent benchmarks, defenses become fragmented and reactive.\n  * Information sharing drops off. The trust-based channels CISA spent years building? They dry up without people to maintain them.\n  * Smaller orgs get hit harder. The ones that depended on CISA for guidance, tooling, and vulnerability scans? Even more exposed.\n  * The whole ecosystem loses visibility. We don't just get slower, we get blinder.\n\n\nRelated:[AI Agents Fail in Novel Ways, Put Businesses at Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-agents-fail-novel-put-businesses-at-risk)\n## And Yes, the Security Debt Piles Up\n\"[Security debt](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/forget-stack-focus-control)\" is already a known issue in cybersecurity — stuff like unpatched vulnerabilities, deferred upgrades, half-baked controls. Budget cuts to CISA don't erase that problem, they supercharge it. Every assessment or red-team penetration test that doesn't happen, every collaboration that stalls, every alert that never gets written just adds to the tab. And like any other kind of debt, it comes with interest. Compound interest.\n## The Only Kind of Trickle-Down That Actually Works\nHere's what often gets overlooked: CISA doesn't just protect federal networks. It sets the tone for the entire cybersecurity ecosystem.\nThe agency and its associated programs have historically been filled with top-tier cybersecurity talent (the kind of people who help define what \"good\" looks like). When they set new security standards or implementation goals, those don't just stay inside federal agencies. They flow outward. Any business that wants to work with the government has to meet those standards. And guess what? Those businesses push the same requirements down to their vendors and partners.\nRelated:[Meta Wins Lawsuit Against Spyware Vendor NSO Group](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/meta-wins-lawsuit-spyware-vendor-nso)\nThat's how best practices spread. That's how secure by default becomes the norm. That's how new technologies and operational improvements actually get adopted in less than a decade. Oh, and it directly contributes to jobs, training programs, and the cybersecurity education pipeline. So yeah, it's not just about defense. It's about economic impact, too.\n## What Comes Next for CISA?\n[If CISA's budget gets gutted](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/cisa-layoffs-momentary-disruption-not-threat), responsibility doesn't disappear. It just shifts. The private sector can't afford to stay passive. That means stepping up: sharing intel, collaborating more, investing in collective defense. Even with competitors. Because cybersecurity was already a team sport. Now it's also a shared burden.\nTo me, this work is just as critical to national defense as any branch of the Department of Defense. Cybersecurity is national security. And CISA is one of the few agencies doing the hard, unglamorous work of connecting the dots before something burns down.\nGut CISA, and we don't just lose a partner. We lose momentum. And in this game, that's when things break.\nRelated:['Bring Your Own Installer' Attack Targets SentinelOne EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/bring-your-own-installer-attack-sentinelone-edr)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/audian-paxson)\n[Audian Paxson](https://www.darkreading.com/author/audian-paxson)\nPrincipal Technical Strategist, IRONSCALES\nAudian Paxson is a recognized authority in enterprise IT infrastructure and cybersecurity with more than 20 years of experience driving innovation in cloud security and advanced threat protection.

This year's list of top-five threats aren't merely technical, and tackling them will demand coordinated leadership from the very top of the organization and beyond.\n\"The attack techniques outlined in the SANS RSAC 2025 keynote underscore a common theme: Cybersecurity is no longer confined to the security operations center — it's a leadership issue that impacts every layer of the enterprise,\" according to a SANS media statement. \"The threats of tomorrow demand a strategic, integrated response rooted in visibility, agility, and cross-functional alignment.\"\nWant to go deeper on this story? Visit [Enterprises Need to Beware of These 5 Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/enterprises-need-beware-five-threats), over at The Edge.\n## Cyber Threat 1: Authorization Sprawl\nFor example, the first threat outlined during the presentation by Joshua Wright, a SANS faculty fellow, was what he called \"authorization sprawl,\" particularly in cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) environments. Users are simply granted too many permissions and authorizations, he said.\n[Scattered Spider](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/socially-savvy-scattered-spider-traps-cloud-admins-in-web) is one threat group that uses this tactic successfully, he said. The attack starts with nabbing and using authorized user credentials that allow an attacker to pivot from user workstations all the way into network infrastructure, at their leisure.\nRelated:[Infrastructure as Code: An IaC Guide to Cloud Security](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/infrastructure-code-iac-guide-cloud-security)\n\"The team crosses these boundaries and their No. 1 tool is just a browser,\" he added. The threat actors are helped by the limitations enterprises have on monitoring across a distributed cloud environment, he explained.\nThe fix Wright that identified is deploying browser endpoint controls, gaining visibility across siloed clouds, and getting serious about logging, in order to gather the necessary evidence for nimble decision-making and incident response.\n## Cyber Threat 2: ICS Ransomware\nTim Conway, SANS technical director of industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA programs, warned that [ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/critical-infrastructure-under-fire-apt-campaigns-escalate) are becoming more prevalent. Moves by organizations to cut human error and boost efficiencies with automation in operational technology (OT) environments create a single point of failure, Conway explained, making it easier for threat actors to cut off essential services.\nConway himself worked on securing utilities prior to joining SANS, and he remarked the sector has an imperative to build resilient systems that can stay up and continue to provide services to citizens no matter what. \"But do we want to keep up a system if a threat actor has control?\" he asked.\nRelated:[AI Domination: RSAC 2025 Social Media Roundup](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/ai-rsac-2025-social-media-roundup)\nGetting OT and IT groups in coordination is one way to stop the rise of ICS ransomware attacks, he advised: \"Enterprises with industrial footprints must establish cohesive strategies that align cybersecurity, operational resilience, and cross-functional governance to mitigate this growing threat\".\n## Cyber Threat 3: Nation-State ICS Attacks\nTiny flaws that evade standard monitoring are where [nation-states](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/nation-state-threats-smb) and their advanced persistent threats (APTs) are finding a way into critical systems with the intent to do real-world harm, Conway said. In order to address the threat coming from groups like [Volt Typhoon ](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/volt-typhoon-ramps-up-malicious-activity-critical-infrastructure)and [Salt Typhoon](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/salt-typhoon-telecom-hacks-one-of-the-most-consequential-campaigns-against/746870/), he said these organizations need to reinvent how they're operating.\n\"It is no longer sufficient to defend against traditional malware; organizations must prepare for kinetic threats with broad operational impact,\" he recommended. \"This includes improving visibility into control systems, reevaluating safety protocol integrity, and building executive-level contingency plans for sustained disruption scenarios.\"\n## Cyber Threat 4: Missing Forensic Artifacts\nRelated:[Getting Outlook.com Ready for Bulk Email Compliance](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/getting-outlook-com-ready-bulk-email-compliance)\n\"We're not learning,\" Heather Mahalik Barnhart, SANS DFIR Curriculum lead and senior director of community engagement at Cellebrite, said during a plea for organizations to ensure they're capturing [critical cloud logging data](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-relents-offers-free-key-logging-365-customers).\n\"Contact your cloud providers,\" she added. \"They can help.\"\nDuring the presentation, she had the house lights lowered to illustrate that without those logs, organizations are leaving themselves in the dark without any evidence to use to track and stop threats.\n\"Despite the [increasing sophistication of attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/cookie-bite-entra-id-attack-exposes-microsoft-365), many organizations fail to adapt their detection strategies accordingly,\" she said. \"To close this gap, enterprises must elevate their incident response maturity by ensuring that systems are configured to capture high-fidelity data, adopting advanced DFIR tools, and continuously training teams to operate in data-constrained environments.\"\n## Cyber Threat 5: AI Regulation\nCyberattackers aren't waiting for permission to unleash AI against their targets, but defenders aren't as fortunate. Rob T. Lee, SANS chief of research and head of faculty, explained that global regulations, particularly the [GDPR in Europe](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/thought-gdpr-compliance-was-hard-buckle-up), have hamstrung cybersecurity practitioners from using AI to evaluate the totality of their organization's environment because they are obliged under privacy regulations to keep data siloed. Evidence that could help other organizations avoid compromise is also restricted by privacy regulations, Lee pointed out.\nThe remedy, according to Lee, is a combination of those in the cybersecurity sector eagerly embracing and learning all they can about the [uses and implications of AI](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/nist-updates-privacy-framework-ai-governance), and then turning around to educate policymakers and regulators in kind. The good news, he added, was that cutting regulations is how the \"Trump administration views the world.\"\nAs SANS said in its statement, \"Enterprises must anticipate and navigate these legal developments to avoid compromising their ability to defend against AI-driven threats. A proactive approach to AI governance and legal compliance will be key to maintaining security posture without regulatory disruption.\"\nWant to go deeper on this story?

Panelists featured Heather Barnhart, DFIR curriculum lead and senior director at SANS Institute and Cellebrite; Ed Skoudis, SANS Technology Institute College president; Tim Conway, ICS curriculum lead at SANS Institute; Rob T. Lee, chief of research and head of faculty at SANS Institute; and Joshua Wright, faculty fellow and senior technical direction at SANS Institute and Counter Hack Innovation. [Like last year](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/top-5-most-dangerous-cyber-threats-in-2024), the session highlighted that, while attackers are adaptable, they continue to target the path of least resistance: open doors and abundant security gaps.\nFollowing a tumultuous year full of disruptive ransomware attacks and a [reportedly record-breaking data breach](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/change-healthcare-breach-190m-people), it came as no surprise that attacks are not only advancing but are plentiful. However, enterprises making \"simple mistakes\" was a recurring theme as the session progressed. Panelists showed how vendors and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) risks contribute to the problem.\nRelated:[SANS Top 5: Cyber Has Busted Out of the SOC](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/sans-top5-cyber-broken-out-soc)\n## Attackers Use Authorized User Privileges\nWhile authorized user privileges are a valuable tool and reduce login friction, attackers are abusing single sign on and access tokens to explore an enterprise's full environment. There they discover sensitive data and resources to exploit. For example, compromised user stations provide threat actors with high levels of access. \nAdversaries can use that access to research patch management statuses for different tickets, use documentation resources to find how the network is configured, or password policies, Wright warned. He explained that threat actors may even access email resources like Microsoft 365 to search for any sensitive content about the organization. That could lead them to gain GitHub access where they can set up GitHub tasks to use privileged access to an infrastructure provider.\n\"We're seeing a scenario where adversaries are leveraging that initial access in single sign in or other authentication tokens to pivot from one resource, to another resource, to the cloud, back to on-prem, and use that to achieve their goals,\" Wright said. \"We refer to that as authorization sprawl.\"\nWright observed this type of activity not only during personal penetration tests but also by threat actors — including the [notorious Scattered Spider](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/-scattered-spider-mgm-cyberattack-casinos).\n\"They use initial access and use all the resources available to them. The No. 1 tool is just a browser,\" he stated. \nBecause they're using resources available to a logged-in user, exploiting those resources and gaining access to sensitive data, defense needs to start with better cross-platform privilege mapping, Wright insisted.\n\"To defend against this new evolution of attacks, it requires better log in from our cloud providers, and better browser visibility,\" he said.\n## ICS OT Targeted by Ransomware\nConway dug into two of the new attack techniques. First, he discussed how heavily [ransomware hits the ICS/OT sector](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/ics-ransomware-rages-fewer-attacks). The systems protect critical infrastructure, often employ legacy systems, and cannot afford the downtime encryption causes.\n\"[Ransomware has] been increasing tremendously across the sector,\" Conway warned. \"As a sector, we have been screaming and talking to vendors for 20 to 30 years and saying, 'We need more security baked into these systems. We need secure by design.'\"\nAs adversaries move down the stack into the OT space, malicious activity will worsen, Conway added. For example, threat actors could impact controllers. Attacks mean operators can't safely operate and effects can be felt for meat production or natural gas.\nHe believes there has been progress but reminded the audience not to forget that an asset owner and operator can get a system and not turn one of the features on.\n\"And just because they don't turn them on doesn't mean an adversary can't get in and turn them on, and lock an asset out,\" Conway said. \"Make sure they don't get misused against us.\"\nAnother topic he addressed was more damaging attacks led by state sponsored threat actors.\n\"We're not just talking about outages or taking a system down,\" Conway said. \"They could misuse it.\"\nHe urged the sector to consider what they can do to limit overall damaging effects if an adversary were to get into the system.\n## Lack of Logging\nThe fourth new attack technique takes advantage of organizations insufficient, or lack of, logging all together. While deemed \"new\" for the session, it's actually a dated problem. And it's a security issue that organizations should be able to fix today, Barnhart said.\n\"Think about how simple that is. It's self-inflicted, and we never seem to learn from our mistakes,\" she emphasized. \"I feel like that's a takeaway I leave you with every year. Here I am again. We're not learning.\"\nBarnhart pleaded with organizations to improve. To properly log, reach out to cloud and on-premises providers. Organizations operate with massive attack surfaces and must assume they could be a victim. And now AI has expanded the surface. The technology is being used to train attackers every day on how to be normal, Barnhart warned. She used the [ByBit heist](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/north-korea-lazarus-crypto-heist) as a \"perfect example of a simple mistake.\"\n\"AI threat detection model did not detect the attack because the cryptocurrency wallet activity appeared normal. We need to log for normal,\" Barnhart said.\n## Evolution of Cyberattacks Leveraging AI\nAI is also enhancing attackers' speed. It helps adversaries move through the enterprise network faster, turning speed into a weapon, Lee said. Phishing techniques are one area that's significantly improved, thanks to AI. Threat actors can craft more legitimate looking emails to trick users. Additionally, Lee explained that they can build phishing emails more accurately by scanning users' current archives.\n\"The rates of success are now above 93% because it is super easy to replicate those emails,\" Lee said.\nThe core problem comes down to enterprises' being bound by policies, procedures, and laws. But the attackers answer to no one. To that end, he called for changes that secure enterprises but don't impede them.\n\"Privacy isn't the enemy,\" Lee said. \"Precision is.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\n[Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nFeatures Writer , Dark Reading \nArielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.\n[See more from Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

The deadline has been decades in the making, but as the years have passed, experts are now mixed about how effective the card really is, and whether it might just be worth skipping to an entirely better system that some states have already introduced.\nBeginning May 7, citizens will be barred from using older, noncompliant driver's licenses to gain entry into federal facilities, nuclear power plants, or — most relevant for most people — to board domestic flights. Congress enacted the Real ID Act on May 11, 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Now that the system it proposed is finally coming to completion, though, it's starting to look a bit rusty in comparison to newer mobile driver's licenses (MDLs) already issued in more than a dozen states.\n\"It's been a long time coming,\" says Will LaSala, director of security solutions at OneSpan, summing up the sentiment. \"But the world has changed quite a bit.\"\n## Real IDs Standardize PII\n\"The idea behind the Real ID is to have a layer of [standardization] across all states, because each state has slightly different requirements for issuing the standard driver's license,\" explains Arif Mamedov, CEO of Regula Forensics Inc.\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\nAt their most basic level, these standards define information all Real IDs must display — essentially the same information already included on any old driver's license — as well as certain ways in which that data must be accessible. For example, Real IDs contain a PDF417 barcode on the back of the card. \nIn America, even this is not trivial. As Mamedov points out, \"a huge challenge around American IDs is their wide diversity. We have thousands of document templates for different American IDs. I don't think any other country has this amount, because there are so many different types of IDs in every US state.\" There are temporary and permanent licenses, commercial licenses, permits, licenses issued to persons under and over the age of 21, non-driver IDs, and more, not to mention the panoply of different designs issued by each state over time. Dark Reading could not verify exactly how many ID templates there are across US states and territories, but rough back-of-the-napkin math suggests it could be in the hundreds.\nStandardizing what appears on IDs, and how it's displayed, is the easier and less flexible component of the Real ID system. More difficult but more flexible is how states can implement the added security features.\nRelated:[TikTok Fined €530 Million Over Chinese Access to EU Data](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/tiktok-fined-530-million-eu-data-servers-china)\n## Security Features in Real IDs\nReal IDs in any state must possess security features for combatting forgery and counterfeiting, measured at three \"levels.\" Level 1 encompasses visual and tactile features of the card, which a person could identify without the use of specialized tools, such as holograms and raised text. Level 2 security features are geared toward trained inspectors with simple equipment, such as ultraviolet (UV) components. Level 3 is for specialists with high-grade equipment and includes special markers identifiable in lab settings, unique materials used in making the card, and other aspects. Although each state must have features accounting for each level, they have some room to decide exactly which features they implement, and how they want to implement them.\nBeyond the card itself, there are rules for ensuring physical security at departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) and performing background checks and training for DMV employees. There are vague protections for cardholders' personally identifiable information (PII) (\"reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity\" of it), and procedures for ensuring that states comply with all of these various rules and regulations.\nRelated:[What NY's New Security Rules Mean for Finance Firms](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/nydfs-rules-businesses-ny)\nAnd, of course, there are procedures that must occur when issuing a Real ID. States must perform facial recognition, for example, which \"makes sure that a set of biographics and an image together are being issued to the person who owns those biographics and the person who looks like that image,\" Andrew Bud, founder and CEO of iProov, explains. \"It's a huge addition to the armory of things that protect citizens from identity theft.\"\nIn the old days, Bud says, it wasn't that hard for someone to get a driver's license issued in someone else's name for the purposes of identity theft and fraud. \"Real ID says: You'd better make sure that the person to whom you're issuing this identity is the person to whom it belongs,\" he says. \"And you'd better make sure that all the details are right.\"\n## A Better Alternative: MDLs\nEven those who see Real IDs as a positive development acknowledge its obvious shortcomings. \"A genuine Real ID carries a lot of trust, but many people who rely on that trust will have difficulty detecting a forged Real ID card,\" Bud says. That's partly because, amid all of their security features, there's one important one missing: unlike passports, and IDs issued in many other countries, Real IDs don't have RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips cryptographically signed by the issuing body. If only in that respect, they leave the door open to potential forgery.\nThat's why, for Bud and other experts, \"the next step is when, as well as your plastic card, you get an [electronic version of the Real ID](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/4-places-where-digital-id-models-falter) which can be stored on your phone. That is the direction [we're going in].\"\n\"The MDL manifestation of the Real ID will be cryptographically protected, and therefore will be immune to forgery and tampering — an unforgeable, untamperable set of biographics with a photograph capturing their face in an unforgeable way. Then you've got a really powerful way for citizens to assert their identities,\" he explains. Fifteen states already offer MDLs: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, and Utah. Puerto Rico and North Carolina will join the list in July.\nLaSala doubles down on the benefits of MDLs. \"It gives us more ability to do validation on demand, and also means that you can keep that data more private — held closer to your person — and you can control the sharing of it,\" Bud says.\n\"Real ID itself still has to graduate a little bit. It was great technology over the last 10, 20 years, but it's still not quite there now.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fb0fcfaede5eaecfbb2caf7ffeafdfbfcafcbeaedeefbeaafddeaeee3afc6cbafdceaecfafde6fbf6afcee7eaeeebafe0e9afc2eef6afb8afcbeaeeebe3e6e1eaa9eee2ffb4ede0ebf6b2c6aabdbffbe7e0fae8e7fbaabdbffbe7eaaabdbfe9e0e3e3e0f8e6e1e8aabdbfe9fde0e2aabdbfcbeefde4aabdbfddeaeeebe6e1e8aabdbfe2e6e8e7fbaabdbfe6e1fbeafdeafcfbaabdbff6e0faa1aabfcbaabfceaabfcbaabfceaabdbfcaf7ffeafdfbfcaabdbfcbeaedeefbeaaabdbfddeaeee3aabdbfc6cbaabdbfdceaecfafde6fbf6aabdbfcee7eaeeebaabdbfe0e9aabdbfc2eef6aabdbfb8aabdbfcbeaeeebe3e6e1eaaabfcbaabfcee7fbfbfffcaabcceaabdc9aabdc9f8f8f8a1ebeefde4fdeaeeebe6e1e8a1ece0e2aabdc9ecf6edeafdfceaecfafde6fbf6a2e0ffeafdeefbe6e0e1fcaabdc9eaf7ffeafdfbfca2fdeaeee3a2e6eba2fceaecfafde6fbf6a2e2eef6a2b8a2ebeaeeebe3e6e1ea)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\n[Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

After similar moves by Google and Yahoo, Microsoft announced earlier this month that it is [enforcing strict email authentication](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/microsoft-boosts-email-sender-rules-outlook) for anyone using Outlook.com to send more than 5,000 emails per day. The decision means Microsoft's email ecosystem will soon get a lot safer. High-volume users of Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, and Live.com can no longer coast with half-cooked solutions. They must configure mail properly if they don't want their messages to land in the junk folder.\nSounds good, right? Well, now the bad news: The deadline for enforcement is May 5, which doesn't leave administrators much time to bring their insecure email infrastructure up to date.\n## The Requirements\nWhether you are at a large organization or a small firm where the same person who sets up email might also be head of HR, the urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. At a time when more than [90% of cyberattacks originate with email](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-guidance-families#:~:text=Think%20before%20you%20click,numbers%2C%20or%20other%20sensitive%20information.), Microsoft has made it clear that email administrators must implement all three authentication methods — DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance), SPF (Sender Policy Framework), and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail).\nUsers must be offered one-click unsubscribe functionality in all promotional emails, and unsubscribe requests must be processed within two business days. And because spoofing has become such a problem, senders can no longer hide behind anonymized addresses. All marketing emails must include an accurate \"From\" name and a physical mailing address.\nSenders must respond to spam complaints within two business days and maintain complaint rates below 0.3%. In addition, senders must maintain proper lists, regularly culling inactive subscribers. Finally, those encryption schemes left over from the early aughts aren't going to cut it anymore. Bulk emails must use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption 1.2 or higher.\n## The Solution\nTo meet the May 5 deadline, organizations must first set up email addresses to receive DMARC reports. A DMARC report is a detailed rundown of all email sent from a particular domain. If you are already set up for DMARC, these reports help protect you against spoofing and improve overall email deliverability. If you are not, the market is filled with DMARC providers to choose from.\nNext, identify legitimate senders that need SPF/DKIM adjustment. For those of you who are new to this game, SPF ensures which IP addresses are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain, while DKIM uses digital signatures, like real-world John Hancocks, to confirm the identity of the sender. If you use Salesforce, HubSpot, Monday.com, or other similar services, you will need to configure each one individually.\nAfter you have visibility into the domains sending, all sources sending, and the root causes of any issues, move your DMARC policy up to \"quarantine\" or \"reject.\" This is the \"almost-there, but not quite\" part of the process because you go right to the final step — constant scanning, constant vigilance. Proper configuration across all the main protocols improves overall security and protects your organization from impersonation.\n## TL;DR\nAt a glance, the technical steps to get to May 5 compliance are:\n  1. Find a DMARC provider.\n  2. Collect DMARC reports.\n  3. Configure SPF and DKIM alignment for major senders on your behalf (e.g. Salesforce, HubSpot). Repeat this step every time a new sender is added as an approved \"asset.\"\n  4. Once all legitimate sensors are configured, set the DMARC policy to enforcement, either \"quarantine\" or \"reject.\"\n  5. Monitor your domains constantly; run regular checks to stay ahead of the latest attack vectors.\n\n\nFinal thought: You are never too small to have these problems. You may think that as a 200-person company you are under the radar for most adversaries, but with [almost 43% of cyberattacks targeting small businesses](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2024/why-small-businesses-are-big-targets-for-cybercriminals-and-6-steps-to-protect-them-this-holiday-shopping-season/), bad actors will always find you. DMARC protection should not be something you farm out and forget about, but real-time intelligence to protect the health of your business.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ab5f9ffe8e0efe9feb7cdeffefee3e4edaac5fffee6e5e5e1a4e9e5e7aad8efebeef3aaece5f8aac8ffe6e1aacfe7ebe3e6aac9e5e7fae6e3ebe4e9efacebe7fab1e8e5eef3b7c3afb8bafee2e5ffede2feafb8bafee2efafb8baece5e6e6e5fde3e4edafb8baecf8e5e7afb8baceebf8e1afb8bad8efebeee3e4edafb8bae7e3ede2feafb8bae3e4feeff8eff9feafb8baf3e5ffa4afbaceafbacbafbaceafbacbafb8bacdeffefee3e4edafb8bac5fffee6e5e5e1a4e9e5e7afb8bad8efebeef3afb8baece5f8afb8bac8ffe6e1afb8bacfe7ebe3e6afb8bac9e5e7fae6e3ebe4e9efafbaceafbacbe2fefefaf9afb9cbafb8ccafb8ccfdfdfda4eeebf8e1f8efebeee3e4eda4e9e5e7afb8cce9e6e5ffeea7f9efe9fff8e3fef3afb8ccedeffefee3e4eda7e5fffee6e5e5e1a7e9e5e7a7f8efebeef3a7e8ffe6e1a7efe7ebe3e6a7e9e5e7fae6e3ebe4e9ef)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/faisal-misle)\n[Faisal Misle](https://www.darkreading.com/author/faisal-misle)\nTechnical Lead, Red Sift, Red Sift\nFaisal Misle is the Technical Lead at Red Sift.

Cyber-resilient organizations focus on how quickly they can bounce back from attacks and minimize downtime and disruptions. Amid reports of data breaches, [successful ransomware attacks](https://www.darkreading.com/data-privacy/ransomware-gangs-innovate-new-affiliate-models), and system compromises, organizations that focused on cyber-resilience to employ defenses against AI-powered attacks are prepared for new threats, according to [a new LevelBlue report](https://levelblue.com/blogs/security-essentials/2025-cyber-resilience-research-discovers-speed-of-ai-advancing-emerging-attack-types) published during RSAC 2025. They invested in supply chain security, advanced threat detection, higher leadership engagement, and social engineering awareness training, the report said. Most cyber-resilient organizations (94%) are investing in software supply chain security versus 62% overall.\nThese organizations have had zero breaches in the past 12 months, use AI to enhance security, and rely on integrated cybersecurity defenses.\n\"Leaders at resilient organizations understand that cybersecurity risk is business risk,\" says Bob Huber, CSO of Tenable. \"They are able to adapt quickly to ensure continued operations and work with partners to surge resources as required. Above all, cyber-resilient organizations have leaders who are able to manage stress effectively while providing their teams the necessary resources and autonomy to execute effectively.\"\nRelated:[Debunking Security 'Myths' to Address Common Gaps](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/debunking-security-myths-common-gaps)\n## AI Security Still Needs Work\nSoftware supply chain security is an ongoing but growing concern amid booming AI use that leads to more issues and vulnerabilities. While the report found that cyber-resilient organizations are investing in software supply chain security, many executives lack sufficient concerns around AI and what that could [mean for the supply chain](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/ciso-corner-securing-ai-supply-chain-ai-powered-security-platforms-cyber-awareness). Only 30% of executives agree that \"AI adoption has caused greater risk to the software supply chain.\" \n\"Organizations are underestimating how underregulated AI tools could pose a risk to their extended ecosystem,\" LevelBlue stated. \"AI adoption is happening too fast for regulations, governance, or mature cybersecurity controls to keep pace, which increases an organization's attack surface area and risk. Our executives' confidence about implementing AI in spite of cybersecurity ramifications again suggests a disconnect.\"\n## Resilience Recommendations\nTaking a proactive approach is another important characteristic of cyber-resilient organizations, says Tenable CSO Bob Huber. But developing both proactive and reactive strategies requires hard work, he adds. Efforts could include exposure management, thorough risk assessment, and inventory management.\nRelated:[DoJ Data Security Program Highlights Data-Sharing Challenges](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/doj-data-security-program-data-sharing-challenge)\nWhen an attack occurs, prepared organizations can respond quickly and confidently because they regularly test and revise their playbooks to not [only focus on incident response](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/shortcomings-improvements-incident-response-plans), but business continuity, disaster recovery, and crisis management as well.\nDue to increased risks and threats introduced over the past few years, effective security postures require shared responsibility among all business leaders — it no longer falls only on the CISO. Security has expanded beyond fulfilling checkbox compliance requirements because companies must protect increasingly critical information and assets from a range of different threats. \n\"One main characteristic of a cyber-resilient organization is full coverage of the enterprise, including endpoints and the network,\" says Chad LeMaire, deputy CISO at ExtraHop. \"The network is especially important as threats can bypass endpoint protections, entering a secure environment under the guise of a legitimate user through a simple tactic like social engineering.\"\nRelated:[Could Ransomware Survive Without Cryptocurrency?](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/ransomware-would-adapt-without-cryptocurrency)\nLike other experts in the industry, LeMaire stresses the importance of a proactive approach with clear incident respomse, business impact, and recovery plans in place. Cyber resilience means conducting security audits on hardware, software, vendors, and supply chain to help security teams stay ahead of vulnerabilities and provide time to address any associated risks.\nRead more about:\n[CISO Corner](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/ciso-corner)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\n[Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nFeatures Writer , Dark Reading \nArielle Waldman is a Boston-based features writer for Dark Reading covering all things cybersecurity.\n[See more from Arielle Waldman](https://www.darkreading.com/author/arielle-waldman)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Over the years, I've seen several business owners who were out of their element when faced with the possibility of becoming a victim of cybercriminal activity. \nA recent breach we responded to is a perfect example of what not to do when your network is controlled by a threat actor. The company's systems were completely down, and no business was able to be conducted. According to the owners, their customers were leaving in droves, so there was an urgent need to become operational again. My incident response team recommended to the customer that forensics immediately begin, gaining a greater understanding of the threat facing the network. According to the customer, we weren't working fast enough, so they decided to \"help.\"\nThe reckless behavior of the customer was uncontrollable. Everything you would hope to do in an incident was either not done or done in reverse. Here are some of the things they did, and yes — this is all true.\n## 10 Examples of Reckless Customer Behavior\n  1. Hey! It's a ransom note. When the customer discovered the ransom note, they immediately logged in to the threat actor's (TA's) onion site and started attempting to negotiate a cheaper price for the decryption key. The customer exhibited no concern about whether they were being scammed or potentially unleashing more malware on their network. The threat actor did reduce the ransom but now expected the payment faster. This makes things difficult because you don't want to anger the TA and have them retaliate with more damage or create an unreasonable demand when they aren't paid on time. \n  2. Who needs backups or insurance? Since the customer had no [backups](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/google-updates-cloud-backup-disaster-recovery-service) or [cyber insurance](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/organizations-leverage-cyber-insurance-effectively) and planned on paying the threat actor, we stressed the importance of hiring an attorney. Paying a group that is sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is a big deal. We explained that paying a terrorist is frowned upon. The customer refused counsel, although finally caved to our demand after we threatened to stop work.\n  3. Why would they infect us again? After the attorney found a payment agent to facilitate the ransom, the customer couldn't get their hands on the decryption key fast enough. We stressed the importance of [sandboxing](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/dangerous-google-chrome-zero-day-sandbox-escape) the decryption key to make sure it wasn't going to harm data. This turned into another fight about not working fast enough. We won the argument and confirmed it was safe to use, but not without creating more tension.\n  4. Just let the threat actor in. What more can they do? As a forensics review was being performed and logs were being examined, my engineers noticed a remote desktop session occurring. When the engineers expressed concern, the customer indicated they had allowed the threat actor to log in and help with decrypting data. My engineers asked, in disbelief, why they would do this. The customer responded, \"Because the threat actor works faster than you.\"\n  5. Is the threat actor Microsoft certified? If the allowed threat actor RDP session wasn't a big enough concern, the customer continued allowing the TA access to clean up the Active Directory. We also noticed the TA cleaning up after themselves by deleting logs. \n  6. My password has a number and a special character. My engineers stressed the importance of changing all credentials. The customer refused, saying an environment password change would be disruptive. Since the TA already had credentials to multiple systems and was working … why change anything?\n  7. So, those things called ports … why should we close them? Our engineers noticed the firewall was configured with an \"ANY-ANY\" ruleset and requested this be locked down. We were denied, while also learning the customer punched unrestricted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to the public Internet. We asked, \"Why would you do this?\" Response: \"To allow the threat actor to help.\" We were speechless.\n  8. EDR! That's too expensive! We suggested the customer purchase an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to help to start tracking events that could be deemed nefarious. The customer initially refused, then begrudgingly purchased two seats, leaving the balance of the systems protected with a \"free version\" of a consumer-based antivirus product. We continued to stare in disbelief. \n  9. Is that threat actor logo created with AI? Our incident response team noticed the desktop backgrounds were changed to feature the moniker of the ransom group. We asked the customer, \"Why haven't those been changed back?\" The customer said because the TA's logo was kind of cool. Again … we were speechless. \n  10. Nobody needs to know our business. The amount of customer data that was exfiltrated by the threat actor was in the hundreds of gigabytes. When reporting about the lost data was discussed, the customer was adamant that they would not report. The attorneys finally did enough convincing to make sure this was done. \n\n\nRelated:['Bring Your Own Installer' Attack Targets SentinelOne EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/bring-your-own-installer-attack-sentinelone-edr)\nAs this incident came to an end, suggestions were made that the customer work with a managed security service partner to prevent an incident like this never happens again. The customer refused, just as we expected. They felt the action they took with the threat actor was more productive with quicker results. They also became oblivious to the fact the threat actor held them up for hundreds of thousands of dollars, compromised their data, their client's data, and damaged their reputation. \nRelated:['Bring Your Own Installer' Attack Targets SentinelOne EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/bring-your-own-installer-attack-sentinelone-edr)\nThe lesson we learned from this customer incident is that it's not easy to reason with the unreasonable. Hopefully, the next incident these people encounter will be a threat actor that has the same service-level agreement as the one that just stole from them.\nRelated:['Bring Your Own Installer' Attack Targets SentinelOne EDR](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/bring-your-own-installer-attack-sentinelone-edr)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/steve-stasiukonis)\n[Steve Stasiukonis](https://www.darkreading.com/author/steve-stasiukonis)\nPresident, Secure Network\nSteve serves as president of Secure Network, focusing on penetration testing, information security risk assessments, incident response and digital investigations.

Administrator Protection lets users install sanctioned apps and peripherals without keeping their PCs in UAC administrator mode.\nAdministrator Protection is among several security enhancements that Microsoft announced in November, when it unveiled its [Windows Resiliency Initiative](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/microsoft-boosts-device-security-windows-resiliency-initiative) road map for improving the security of the client OS. Microsoft accelerated the initiative's timeline to double down on improving Windows security in response to last summer's [flawed CrowdStrike update](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/crowdstrike-outage-losses-estimated-staggering-54b), which caused millions of commercial Windows devices to crash. Administrator Protection will be available in preview mode and then be turned on by default by year's end, according to David Weston, Microsoft's corporate VP for enterprise and OS security.\nWeston believes that the scourge of credential-based attacks will be curbed once users and organizations implement Administrator Protection.\n\"I've been calling it the most significant architectural change in Windows from a security perspective in a generation,\" Weston says.\nRelated:[Cisco Boosts XDR Platform, Splunk With Agentic AI](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/cisco-boosts-xdr-platform-splunk-agentic-ai)\n## The Problem With UAC\nUAC, introduced in 2007 with the release of Windows Vista and used more broadly in Windows 7, lets users choose between administrator and standard user modes. Although not recommended, users and organizations typically set up and run their PCs in administrator mode to accommodate frequent updates and installation of drivers and applications.\nWhile setting UAC to admin mode is more convenient, it has also become easy for threat actors to engage in credential dumping and malicious driver attacks. The recommended approach of configuring PCs to default to standard user mode requires the PC to log out and reboot to administrator mode.\nAdministrator Protection, which Microsoft has integrated with Windows Hello, is designed to replace UAC with an approach where users can log in only as a standard user. When users need to install something that requires administrative rights, if the policy allows for it, an admin token issued by an isolated administrator account grants \"just-in-time elevation rights\" specifically for the time necessary for that task. Windows then discards the token.\n\"We are now creating two accounts on the machine for every user — one that's standard user and one that's admin — and the user is always running as a standard user,\" Weston explains. \"Let's say you need to install a driver. No problem. You double-click the driver, and you authenticate with Windows Hello. Then, under the hood, we run that driver payload in this secondary admin account. So you never log into this admin account. It's just there for authorized operations.\"\nRelated:['Digital Twins' Bring Simulated Security to the Real World](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/digital-twins-bring-simulated-security-real-world)\n## Curbing Unauthorized Privilege Escalation\nThis approach of using a separate account that isolates the token prevents malware from infiltrating the session and allowing a threat actor to gain unauthorized access. Administrator Protection doesn't allow automated elevation of privileges; users must authorize each attempt to make system changes.\nGartner analyst Chris Silva says Administrator Protection should help curb attacks using valid credentials, which are on the rise.\n\"Extending least-privilege controls to all identities and limiting expanded rights to time-based tasks are ideal steps to thwart these types of attacks,\" he says.\nSilva notes that while this approach is not entirely new, implementing it has only been within reach at organizations with well-resourced security operations and sufficient budgets to invest in what are often considered overlay technologies.\nRelated:[HP Brings Quantum-Safe Encryption to Printers](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/hp-brings-quantum-safe-encryption-printers)\n\"Placing the enforcement of role- and purpose-based access controls natively in the OS expands the potential for the ways in which — and even the tools by which — these controls can be used,\" he says.\nForrester senior analyst Paddy Harrington agrees.\n\"I could be cynical and say, 'Should have done that 20 years ago,' but it's a great move to reduce the ability to compromise the endpoint, never mind the enterprise, and I do think that security teams, including the CISO, will appreciate this move,\" he says.\nAccording to Microsoft's Weston, the company didn't offer Administrator Protection in the past because Windows Hello and TPMs weren't available on every PC, especially older systems designed for Windows 10 or Windows 7.\nNow that Microsoft is preparing to end support for Windows 10, most supported Windows 11 PCs will support Windows Hello. Systems that don't have the hardware necessary to use Windows Hello biometrics can still use PINs. \n\"We think customers are ready for it, so if they have to trade off seeing more prompts or having apps that would have issues around this, they'd be willing to trade off for that,” Weston says. “So now is the right time to make such a huge change.\"\nDespite the benefits, shifting to Administrator Protection will require some changes.\n\"It will mean some more work between IT and security management on setting policies to ensure users can still do what they need without admin rights,\" Forrester's Harrington says. \"But you can't get more security without having to make some configuration changes.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jeffrey-schwartz)\n[Jeffrey Schwartz](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jeffrey-schwartz)\nContributing Writer\nJeffrey Schwartz is a journalist who has covered information security and all forms of business and enterprise IT, including client computing, data center and cloud infrastructure, and application development for more than 30 years.

At the same time, though, a historically low number of those have actually materialized into serious events with real consequences. Whatever the reason for that — Ukraine is improving cyber-defense capabilities, Russia's increasing reliance on automation, or something else altogether — the risk of the tide turning remains high because Russia increasingly is focusing on attacks against high-value government and military targets.\n\"There's a huge cyber power which is targeting the entire country, and this cyber power is fully supporting their conventional war,\" Victor Zhora, former deputy chairman of State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (SSSCIP), emphasized in an interview with Dark Reading at Cybertech Global 2025. \"Their strategy is to gain an advantage on the battlefield, where [cyber serves military purposes](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/sandworm-cyberattackers-ukrainian-power-grid-missile-strikes).\"\n## More Attacks in Ukraine, Fewer of Them Serious\nCERT-UA attributed 4,315 cybersecurity incidents to Russian intelligence services in 2024, compared with just 2,543 in 2023. Even counting on an annual basis, though, hides just how upward this trend has been. According to a newly published CERT-UA report, within 2024, [the volume of attacks rose 48%](https://cip.gov.ua/en/news/russian-cyber-operations-attack-automation-espionage-against-defense-sector-and-new-tactics-analysis-for-the-second-half-of-2024) from the first (1,739) to the second (2,576) half of the year.\nRelated:['CoGUI' Phishing Kit Helps Chinese Hackers Target Japan](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cogui-phishing-kit-chinese-hackers-japan)\nOne might assume from this data that Ukraine is struggling more than ever to fight its bête noire on the cyber battlefield. But according CERT-UA, that's not the case.\nOf those thousands of incidents, just 55 were deemed of \"high\" severity, and a paltry four were deemed \"critical.\" Ten high-severity incidents occurred during the entire second half of the year, and only one critical: a disruptive attack on Ukraine's Ministry of Justice state registries on Dec. 19.\nIn this light, the war in Ukraine mimics the war on the ground: Russia coming up with new ways to [throw volume at the problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html) but enjoying limited benefit from it.\n## Russia Homes in on Government and Military Targets\nThe more worrying sign for Ukraine is Russia's increasing focus on targets of high value to its war effort. \nSince 2021, Ukrainian government agencies and local authorities have been subject to somewhere between 20% to 25% of all cyberattacks coming from Russia. In 2024, that figure more than doubled to 58%.\nRelated:[CISA Warns 2 SonicWall Vulnerabilities Under Active Exploitation](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/two-sonicwall-vulnerabilities-under-exploitation)\nAgain, the curve is sloping upward even within 2024. Attacks against governmental organizations rose 41% from the first to the second half of the year, and attacks against local authorities rose 53%.\nA similar story can be told about the military. Only 7% of all attacks against Ukraine in 2023 affected its security and defense sectors, but that number was back up to 18% in 2024. And if one compares the first half of the year to the secondr, [military cyberattacks](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/israel-stage-3-cyber-wars-with-iran-proxies) rose 82%.\nZhora recalls how \"they've tried to hack Delta\" — Ukraine's battlefield management system — \"they've tried to hack military servants' phones. The recent operation with [fake QR codes that led Signal users to C2 servers in Russia](https://www.darkreading.com/mobile-security/russian-groups-target-signal-messenger-in-spy-campaign) — that was one rather successful case. We cannot [assess] the impact in how it helped Russian troops, but suddenly there have been some limited successes in this military domain.\"\nIt speaks to a broader point: that Russia sees significant return on investment in cyber operations affecting the battlefield. As a case in point, Zhora points to Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Unit 29155. \"This military unit was previously involved in special operations on the ground, not in cyber. But they explored new cyber capabilities — added that to their day-to-day activity — and now they're serving as a new actor,\" he notes.\nRelated:[Phony Hacktivist Pleads Guilty to Disney Data Leak](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/phony-hacktivist-pleads-guilty-disney-leak)\nIn fact, he adds, \"that was the exact actor responsible for the attack on Ukrainian government websites on Jan. 14 2022, which some researchers, including me, consider as the beginning of the full-scale war, the first phase being cyber.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\n[Nate Nelson, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/nate-nelson)\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

It has used legitimate but out-of-date binaries from security firms to load malicious software components onto targeted systems in order to compromise them, according to [the Symantec threat analysis](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/billbug-china-espionage).\nWhile the group has expanded its focus beyond government and military organizations to include private industry, they focus almost exclusively in the Southeast Asia region, says Dick O'Brien, principal threat intelligence analyst for the Symantec Threat Hunter Team.\n\"They have quite a tight focus on Southeast Asia, and it's rare to see them go further afield,\" he says. \"From what we can see, they don't seem to target any nation more than others, although the bigger, wealthier states in the region tend to attract proportionally more attention.\"\nRelated:['CoGUI' Phishing Kit Helps Chinese Hackers Target Japan](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cogui-phishing-kit-chinese-hackers-japan)\nResearchers first observed Billbug in 2015, when cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks [published a report](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/unit42-operation-lotus-blossom) on the group's attacks against 50 different targets over three years. Even in the earliest-discovered attacks dating to 2012, the group — which Palo Alto Networks refers to as Lotus Blossom — focused on regional targets, [attacking a digital certificate authority in November 2022](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/china-based-billbug-apt-infiltrates-certificate-authority).\nThe network infrastructure used by Billbug in 2015, which shows the same set of targets as today. Source: Palo Alto Networks (2015)\n\"While all of the Lotus Blossom attacks appear to be the work of a single group, the infrastructure used to target each nation is largely separate,\" Palo Alto Networks stated in its 2015 report, adding that domains and IP addresses in the configuration files only overlap in a few places. \"These links create a visual map of the attacks, which shows that, while the infrastructure is not identical in each attack, they are all connected.\"\n## An Evolving Malware Platform\nBillbug also mixes up the variant of its backdoor used to execute commands and gain persistence on compromised systems. The malware goes by different names: Elise in the original Palo Alto Networks' report and Sagerunex by Cisco Talos and Broadcom Symantec researchers. The Sagerunex backdoor has been used by the group [at least since 2016](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/espionage-lotus-blossom-south-east-asia), but Billbug has created many variants of the tools, according to Joey Chen, a threat intelligence researcher with Cisco Talos.\nRelated:['Industrial-Scale' Asian Scam Centers Expand Globally](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/industrial-scale-asian-scam-centers)\nIn a February threat analysis of the group, Chen found versions of Sagerunex that used the online services Dropbox, X, and Zimbra as command-and-control channels for communication.\n\"The Sagerunex backdoor employ[s] various network connection strategies to ensure it remains under the actor's control,\" Chen stated in [the February threat analysis of the group](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lotus-blossom-espionage-group/). \"Despite the development of three distinct variants, the foundational structures and core functionalities of the backdoor remain consistent.\"\nBillbug has also deployed new tools to steal credentials and cookies from the popular Chrome Web browser, as well as a backdoor program that will open up a Secure Shell (SSH) connection on compromised systems.\n## A Panda by Any Other Name ...\nThe Symantec analysis did not name the countries affected by the latest attacks. The Billbug group has frequently targeted the Philippines, as China and the island nation dispute territory in the South China Sea. The group has reportedly sent spear-phishing emails to military experts in the field with purportedly sensitive documents as a lure.\nRelated:[Japan Warns on Unauthorized Stock Trading via Stolen Credentials](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/japan-unauthorized-stock-trading-stolen-credentials)\nSuch combined military and cyber actions have become common, according to CrowdStrike, which refers to the group as Lotus Panda.\n\"For developed world powers, military doctrine is now inextricably linked with cyber capabilities,\" CrowdStrike's cyber-adversary operations [stated in a 2015 analysis](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/rhetoric-foreshadows-cyber-activity-in-the-south-china-sea/).\nOther cyber-espionage groups have branched out into cybercrime, appearing to conduct espionage during work hours while pursuing cybercrime during off-hours. Billbug has not, Symantec's O'Brien says. \"Billbug seems to be one of those groups that sticks to pure espionage.\"\nRead more about:\n[DR Global Asia Pacific](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/asia-pacific)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\n[Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/robert-lemos)\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

Among the additions to Cisco XDR is Instant Attack Verification, which Cisco announced this week at the RSAC Conference in San Francisco.\nInstant Attack Verification uses agentic AI to initiate and process incident investigations autonomously. Agentic AI raises the AI bar with higher levels of reasoning and decision-making, using advanced large language models (LLMs) and integrations from other tools and systems.\nCisco first indicated it would introduce agentic AI capabilities to its security platforms last year.\n\"Agentic AI systems can make rapid decisions, manage complex tasks, and adapt to changing conditions,\" [wrote](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/agentic-ai-a-game-changer-for-it) Denise Shiffman, Cisco's senior VP of networking strategy. \"They have agency to reach beyond the data their large language model was trained on and interact with external environments, such as IoT sensors, cloud platforms or analytics software.\" \nInstant Attack Verification uses telemetry from Splunk and other sources, including Cisco Firewall, Cisco Secure Network Analytics, and Cisco Secure Endpoint, said AJ Shipley, Cisco's VP of threat, detection, and response, during a media demo.\nRelated:[Microsoft Readies Administrator Protection Option for Windows 11](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/microsoft-readies-administrator-protection-option-windows-11)\nInstant Attack Verification provides a confidence score, which prioritizes attacks so that the most severe can be thwarted faster and more precisely, he explained. Shipley showed how multiple agents running in a coordinated manner can accelerate the investigation process.\n\"We have fully automated the investigation process, which would typically take an organization and a team of three or four or five analysts to do, and it would take, typically, multiple hours,\" Shipley said.\nUsing multiple agents should take less than 20 seconds, he added.\n\"Just like in the real world, the best way to tackle a complex problem is to divide and conquer,\" Shipley says. \"And that's what we've done with these multiple agents. We divide the problem up and assign a specific agent that's really good at that part of the problem, as well as an agent to coordinate all of this together.\"\nOther new features with new agentic AI capabilities in Cisco XDR include XDR Forensics, which offers more visibility into endpoint activity and the ability to provide more accurate investigations. Another is XDR Storyboard, which Cisco says visualizes complex attacks and helps security teams understand threats within seconds, enabling them to respond more quickly and decisively.\nRelated:['Digital Twins' Bring Simulated Security to the Real World](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/digital-twins-bring-simulated-security-real-world)\n## New Open Source Reasoning Model\nIn an effort to accelerate the creation of customized AI models for cybersecurity attacks, Cisco revealed it has formed Foundation AI, a team focused on building open source models. Yaron Singer, founder of [Robust Intelligence](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/cisco-previews-ai-defense-cloud-security), which Cisco acquired last year, is leading that effort.\nSinger explained that proprietary AI models not built explicitly for cybersecurity tasks are expensive to use, difficult to customize, and have frequent changes, with access often limited to APIs only.\n\"When we're looking at open source models, they outperform on cybersecurity tasks,\" Singer said. \nThe AI reasoning model is an open source Meta Llama 3.1 8B framework, which Singer said has 1 billion parameters pretrained with cybersecurity data that the Foundation AI team collected.\nSinger explained in a blog post that the reasoning model, called \"[foundation-sec-8b](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/foundation-sec-cisco-foundation-ai-first-open-source-security-model),\" is pretrained on a dataset that Foundation AI created.\n\"This dataset was curated specifically to capture the real-world knowledge and context that security professionals work with every day,\" he noted.\nAmong the datasets outlined by Singer include:\n  * Vulnerability databases and threat behavior mappings (e.g., CVEs, CWEs, MITRE ATT&CK)\n  * Threat intelligence reports, red team playbooks, and real-world incident summaries\n  * Security tooling documentation across cloud, identity, and infrastructure domains\n  * Compliance references and secure development practices (e.g., NIST, OWASP, secure coding guides)\n\n\nRelated:[HP Brings Quantum-Safe Encryption to Printers](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/hp-brings-quantum-safe-encryption-printers)\nCisco executive VP and chief product officer Jeetu Patel noted that the significance isn't just from the volume of the data but its relevance.\n\"One of the features of this model is that it's compact and really performant, and it can actually be deployed in constrained environments, so you can actually run it on a single, [NVIDIA] A100 GPU,\" he said.\nPatel emphasized that because it's an open source model, it can be fine-tuned more effectively.\n\"We basically created domain alignment, and then we also provide tools to make these fine-tuning models for cybersecurity tasks very easy to do,\" he said.\n## Integrating Cisco AI Defense With ServiceNow SecOps\nCisco also announced that it has expanded its partnership with ServiceNow to integrate their respective AI capabilities. First on the agenda is linking Cisco's new [AI Defense](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/cisco-previews-ai-defense-cloud-security) features with ServiceNow [SecOps](https://www.servicenow.com/products/security-operations.html) to offer combined customers improved AI risk management and governance.\nAI Defense, launched in January and released last month is a software-as-a-service offering zero-trust network access, VPN-as-a-service, a secure Web gateway, cloud access security broker, firewall-as-a-service, and digital experience monitoring.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jeffrey-schwartz)\n[Jeffrey Schwartz](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jeffrey-schwartz)\nContributing Writer\nJeffrey Schwartz is a journalist who has covered information security and all forms of business and enterprise IT, including client computing, data center and cloud infrastructure, and application development for more than 30 years.

The security vendor did not offer any explanation for the rapidly growing RansomHub operation's seemingly sudden and unexpected demise — if that is indeed what it is.\nBut GuidePoint Security earlier this month noted that a \"[series of internal disagreements](https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/blog/ransomsnub-ransomhubs-affiliate-confusion/)\" between RansomHub administrators and some affiliates had caused disruptions within the RaaS operation. The disagreements apparently stirred unease among other RansomHub affiliates, who began diverting their communications with victims to rival platforms.\nShortly after RansomHub's chat infrastructure and data-leak site went offline on March 31, the rival RaaS group DragonForce announced on the Russian cybercrime forum RAMP that RansomHub was migrating its operations to DragonForce's new ransomware cartel platform, according to GuidePoint.\nRelated:['Venom Spider' Targets Hiring Managers in Phishing Scheme](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/venom-spider-phishing-scheme)\n\"Further muddying the waters, DragonForce goes on to request in their post that RansomHub 'consider [their] offer,' leaving it unclear whether the move is actual or proposed, and whether such actions were concomitant or unilateral,\" GuidePoint researchers wrote. \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the posts represent a form of 'trolling' or opportunistic advertising on the part of DragonForce.\"\n## Surprise Development\nWhatever the reason, RansomHub's apparent cessation of operations — even if it ultimately turns out to be only a temporary one — is notable. The RaaS operation surfaced in February 2024 at a time when law enforcement actions against leading ransomware gangs such as [LockBit](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/global-law-enforcement-disrupts-lockbit-ransomware-gang) and [ALPHV](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/alphv-blackcat-takedown-appears-to-be-law-enforcement-related) had caused considerable turmoil among those affiliated with these operations.\nRansomHub administrators attracted some of these affiliates by giving them the autonomy to communicate directly with victims and to collect ransom payments from them, both of which were not the norm. They also demanded a much lower 10% cut of ransom payments from affiliates, which was a sharp contrast to the 20% and even 30% fees charged by RaaS operators like LockBit and ALPHV, Group-IB said in its report this week.\nRelated:[A Cybersecurity Paradox: Even Resilient Organizations Are Blind to AI Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/even-resilient-organizations-bind-ai-threats)\nRansomHub's multiplatform encryptor malware was another selling point. It worked on Windows, Linux, ESXi, and FreeBSD systems running on x86, x64, and ARM microprocessor-based hardware. The malware's added ability to encrypt local and remote file systems via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and Server Message Block (SMB) shares gave affiliates a broad range of systems to target.\nRansomHub's operators prohibited affiliates from targeting organizations in former Soviet republics (Commonwealth of Independent States) as well as those in China, Cuba, and North Korea. They also urged affiliates to refrain from attacking government agencies because of the high risk of retribution and low return on investment. But beyond those caveats, RansomHub affiliates had few restrictions on whom they could target, including healthcare organizations. RansomHub affiliates routinely attacked hospitals, medical clinics, and other healthcare-related entities to such an extent that Group-IB labeled them as the group that \"most victimized\" organizations in the sector in 2024.\n## Broad Victim Targeting\nRelated:[Debunking Security 'Myths' to Address Common Gaps](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/debunking-security-myths-common-gaps)\nIn addition to the healthcare sector, RansomHub affiliates have also been targeting organizations in critical infrastructure, financial services, and the [government sector](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/ransomhub-fakeupdates-government-sector), according to Darktrace, one of several vendors tracking the group's activities. \"They use ransomware variants rewritten in GoLang to target both Windows and Linux systems,\" Darktrace said in a [February blog post](https://www.darktrace.com/blog/ransomhub-revisited-new-front-runner-in-the-ransomware-as-a-service-marketplace). \"RansomHub is known for employing double extortion attacks, encrypting data using 'Curve25519' encryption.\"\nRansomHub also offered detailed guidance to affiliates on how to extort ransom payments from victims. The gang's advice included deleting backups, Windows Shadow Copies, and virtual machine snapshots to ensure victims could not recover their own data. Other suggested tactics for increasing pressure on victims included sending a blog post describing the leak to the victim, and then threatening to publicly post it if the victim refused to pay or tried negotiating a lower payment. \"Publishing the blog directly will cause the attention of law enforcement agencies which may result in the target company being asked by law enforcement agencies not to pay,\" RansomHub admins advised in a screenshot of a Negotiation FAQ, which Group-IB published in its report.\nThe admins also helpfully advised their affiliates to pressure victims by threatening to report a ransomware incident to data regulators such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \"By that, affiliates can propose as a counteroffer a ransom price lower than the amount of the fine the victim could eventually pay to the regulator,\" Group-IB quoted the ransomware operator as saying on its affiliate panel.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#320d414750585751460f62405d5e5b545b511260535c415d5f7a4750127d42574053465b5d5c12755d5741127653405914535f4209505d564b0f7b170002465a5d47555a46170002465a57170002545d5e5e5d455b5c5517000254405d5f17000276534059170002605753565b5c551700025f5b555a461700025b5c4657405741461700024b5d471c17027617027317027617027317000262405d5e5b545b5117000260535c415d5f7a47501700027d42574053465b5d5c170002755d5741170002765340591702761702735a464642411701731700741700744545451c56534059405753565b5c551c515d5f170074514b5057401f405b415917007442405d5e5b545b511f40535c415d5f5a47501f5d42574053465b5d5c1f555d57411f56534059)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\n[Jai Vijayan, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

The panelists addressed how federal actions, such as CISA cuts and high-profile firings, along with recent incidents, are shaping the US cyber landscape. Some of the panelists included former CISA Director Jen Easterly, Proofpoint CEO Sumit Dhawan, and Snyk CEO Peter McKay.\nEasterly published a  to LinkedIn on April 25, where she spoke out against the [recent firings of General Tim Haugh](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/trump-fires-nsa-director-head-us-cyber-command/744480/), the now former Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Commander of US Cyber Command, and his deputy director, Wendy Noble. Easterly also criticized Trump's recent executive order targeting Chris Krebs, Easterly's predecessor at CISA who spoke out against Trump's unfounded accusations of voter fraud and was [subsequently fired in 2020](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252492323/President-Trump-fires-CISA-director-Christopher-Krebs).\n\"What’s happening now is not a policy disagreement, but something dark: the targeting and removal of nonpartisan public servants and the normalization of loyalty oaths to something other than our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"And if we — who aim to protect critical systems — can't defend the humans who manage and maintain them, what exactly are we securing?\"\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\nThe panel was back-to-back with a session led by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, [who discussed](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/dhs-secretary-noem-cisa-back-on-mission) cutting $10 million from CISA's budget and pledged that the agency will no longer be a \"ministry of truth.\"\n## Former CISA Director Weighs in on First 100 Days\nDuring the panel, Easterly said that although she is no longer on the inside of CISA, she has talked to many former coworkers and said that those leaving the cyber agency are \"some of the most talented and collaborative public servants I've had the opportunity to work with during my career, so on balance I think that's a real loss for the federal government, but more so, it's a loss for the American people.\"\nShe felt that some of the losses occurred \"because there is a mandate for loyalty to a person over loyalty to the Constitution of the United States of America.\" Easterly said that, too, is a loss for the American people.\n\"Cyber security is national security. It must be a non-partisan, non-political issue. And of course, anybody that serves, to include whether you're serving the federal government or whether you're serving in uniform, you pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution in the United States of America,\" the former CISA director said. \"I think Americans should be bothered if there's some other loyalty being required.\"\nRelated:[TikTok Fined €530 Million Over Chinese Access to EU Data](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/tiktok-fined-530-million-eu-data-servers-china)\nAs for cuts to CISA, Easterly said the agency is the newest operational component in the Department of Homeland Security as well as the smallest budget-wise. As such, she said, \"To be charitable, I think perhaps the new leadership in the department that is still forming has not had the opportunity to dig deep into the CISA statute.\" The statute that created CISA was signed in November 2018 by President Trump, with Krebs as its first director.\nFinally, on the DHS's aims to reign in CISA due to its election security mission, Easterly said only about 1.5% of CISA's $3 billion budget — or roughly $45 million — was dedicated to election security. Moreover, the mission was introduced because election infrastructure was designated as critical infrastructure after Russia made multiple efforts to undermine election security.\n\"Frankly, I was very, very proud of that mission,\" she said. \"We worked very closely to provide cyber security and physical security support to state and local election officials on the front lines, and administering, managing and securing election infrastructure.\"\nRelated:[What NY's New Security Rules Mean for Finance Firms](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/nydfs-rules-businesses-ny)\nShe continued, \"If the issue is with that 1.5% of CISA's budget, then maybe election infrastructure should not be designated as critical infrastructure. That, of course, is their decision to make but that, again, I think would be at the detriment of the American people, because election security is not a political, partisan mission.\"\n## Current Impact Remains Unclear\nDespite controversies surrounding the Trump administration or cyber budgetary cuts, there are still federal resources being dedicated to cybersecurity.\nDARPA officials yesterday [held an RSAC session](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/darpa-highlights-critical-infrastructure-security-challenges) that outlined how the agency was addressing critical infrastructure security challenges, for example. And CISA, as well as its partners such as the FBI, still offers [many cybersecurity services](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services) to defenders including regular threat intelligence updates.\nIt's also worth noting that at RSAC this year, Flashpoint CEO Josh Lefkowitz and Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's senior vice president of counter adversary operations, each told Dark Reading they have noticed \"no degradation\" in cyber services and communications from the federal government. However, there are [real risks](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/how-cisa-cuts-impact-election-security) if certain services were to degrade over time.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\n[Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nDark Reading\nAlex is a writer, journalist, and podcaster based in Boston.\n[See more from Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

[Salt Typhoon](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/what-should-us-do-salt-typhoon), a China-backed threat group, is particularly scary, having demonstrated uncanny skill in breaching sensitive networks. In fact, panel moderator Frank Cilluffo, director of the McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security at Auburn University, said Salt Typhoon's attacks represent the most egregious cyber espionage against the US ever, adding it crossed a \"red line.\" However, to date, there has been no penalty imposed.\n\"That's bullshit,\" retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery responded. \"We should be tackling this with a sense of urgency.\"\nMontgomery explained that if a cruise missile hit a utility, there would be a nationwide uproar, and the Department of Defense would immediately engage in the issue. But when it comes to cyberattacks, organizations are left to rely on government agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), which in particular is undergoing a massive transformation at the direction of the new Trump administration.\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\nCISA's workforce and budget has been slashed by the new administration, which Moira Bergin, staff director for the minority Democrats on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, US House of Representatives, said ranking Democrats are very concerned about. Later in the day, during another RSAC 2025 conference presentation, Department of Homeland Security Secretary [Kristi Noem said](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/dhs-secretary-noem-cisa-back-on-mission) $10 million has already been cut from the agency's budget.\n\"We want to preserve CISA,\" Bergin said. \"We are trying to bring oversight to the loss of workforce at CISA and try to understand how that will effect our readiness.\"\nShe added that Trump officials have pledged to make US cybersecurity a priority, but Bergin added, \"money talks,\" and said Trump's announcement of his 2026 budget plans due in the next weeks would signal their true commitment to the cause.\n## US Going on 'Offense'\nThe new Republican administration says it's focused on offense, and making cyberattackers pay a price for their nefarious activities against the US. But there is little detail coming out of DC about what those costs might be. Noem pledged to be an enforcer on behalf of the private sector. But it's unclear how DHS could reach a nation-state actor working for Beijing, well out of reach of US law enforcement.\nRelated:[TikTok Fined €530 Million Over Chinese Access to EU Data](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/tiktok-fined-530-million-eu-data-servers-china)\nAlexandra Seymour, staff director, subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, US House of Representatives, outlined Republican cybersecurity priorities for the 119th Congress.\nCyber workforce development was first on the list, being championed under new legislation called the [Providing Individuals Various Opportunities for Technical Training](https://homeland.house.gov/2024/09/24/chairman-green-introduces-cyber-pivott-act-to-tackle-government-cyber-workforce-shortage-create-pathways-for-10000-new-professionals/) (PIVOTT) to Build a Skills-Based Cyber Workforce Act of 2024, or the Cyber PIVOTT Act, introduced by House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-TN) in September of 2024.\nRepublicans are also working on regulatory harmonization and making reporting requirements less onerous for the private sector, Seymour said. \"We want to make sure that we're getting the kind of information that counts,\" she said, rather than burying business under a pile of reporting requirements.\nFinally, Seymour said Republicans are trying to change the economic model of cybersecurity.\n\"How do we raise the cost of a cyberattack so that adversaries don't want to hit us?\" she asked. There was no elaboration on what those costs could be or how they could be achieved.\nRelated:[What NY's New Security Rules Mean for Finance Firms](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/nydfs-rules-businesses-ny)\nProblematic and slow information sharing is still dogging the cyber sector, but as Cilluffo pointed out, these are the same conversations the industry has been having for a decade. What needs to happen now, he added, was to transform information sharing into operational activity. However, that's not what policy makers and legislators are focused on, according to House staffers Bergin and Seymour.\nUltimately, Montgomery said the US needs to stand up a cyber force branch of the military to handle this work. But that doesn't address the immediate risks to the nation.\nAs it stands now, Montgomery said the NSA is there to evaluate threats happening overseas and warn US organizations before they hit our shores. CISA, meanwhile has a role as an information-sharing intermediary between the government and the private sector, he added.\nShort term, it's going to be up to the private sector to get things moving in the right direction. Bergin suggested professionals start to contact legislators and make a plea for more advanced policy making. Noem also invited the cybersecurity private sector call up CISA and tell them what they need.\n\"The squeaky wheel gets the oil,\" Bergin said. \"That's just how it works.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\n[Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nSenior Editor, Dark Reading, Dark Reading\nBecky Bracken is a veteran multimedia journalist covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

TheWizards campaign also stand out thanks to the discovery of Spellbinder, and the discovery of potential links to the Earth Minotaur APT.\n## Targeting Gambling Companies & Gamblers for Espionage\nRelated:[DDoS Attacks Surge as Africa Expands Its Digital Footprint](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/ddos-attacks-surge-africa-digital-footprint)\nTheWizards, first seen in 2022, has been constantly active, mainly targeting gambling companies and their customers in the Philippines, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, mainland China, and Hong Kong, according to ESET. This campaign is no different, though Boutin says it's unclear what the motivations are for targeting the betting sector.\n\"We're not sure why TheWizards is pursuing the victims that they are, but they've been doing this consistently for at least two years,\" he says.\nThe researchers originally noticed a popular Chinese software application known as Sogou Pinyin — named after a legitimate component of that software — downloading a suspicious DLL. It turns out that the DLL was a dropper that set off a multistep infection routine leading to WizardNet.\nIn the latest campaigns, the researchers have uncovered the use of Spellbinder, which contains a hardcoded list of domains associated with several popular Chinese platforms, such as Tencent, Baidu, Xunlei, Youku, iQIYI, Kingsoft, Mango TV, Funshion, Yuodao, Xiaomi and Xioami’s Miui, PPLive, Meitu, Quihoo 360, Baofeng, and others.\n\"Our research led to the discovery of a tool, used by the attackers, that is designed to perform adversary-in-the-middle attacks using IPv6 SLAAC spoofing to intercept and reply to packets in a network, allowing the attackers to redirect traffic and serve malicious updates targeting legitimate Chinese software,\" according to [the report](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/thewizards-apt-group-slaac-spoofing-adversary-in-the-middle-attacks/). \"One of the latest cases in 2024 … hijacked the update of Tencent QQ software.\"\nRelated:[Infrastructure as Code: An IaC Guide to Cloud Security](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/infrastructure-code-iac-guide-cloud-security)\nThe Spellbinder AitM attack in that case worked as follows:\n  1. The legitimate software component QQ.exe sends an HTTP request to update.browser.qq.com.\n  2. The Spellbinder tool intercepts the DNS query for that domain name and issues a DNS answer with the IP address of an attacker-controlled server used for hijacking the Tencent update mechanism.\n  3. When the request is received by the hijacking server, it replies with instructions to download an archive containing a DLL downloader.\n  4. The downloader in turn uses the WinSock API to connect via TCP to the attacker-controlled server and download an encrypted blob containing a loader shellcode and the WizardNet backdoor.\n  5. The loader begins by attempting to use a well-known bypass for the AMSI mechanism that scans memory for malicious artifacts. Then, it disables Event Logging.\n  6. It decrypts and runs the WizardNet payload.\n\n\n\"The final payload is a backdoor that we named WizardNet — a modular implant that connects to a remote controller to receive and execute .NET modules on the compromised machine … thus extending its functionality on the compromised system,\" according to ESET.\nRelated:[AI Domination: RSAC 2025 Social Media Roundup](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/ai-rsac-2025-social-media-roundup)\n## Chinese APT Connections: Links to the Earth Minotaur APT\nNotably, TheWizards has connections to another, better-known Chinese APT called Earth Minotaur.\nIn December 2024, Trend Micro researchers flagged an [Earth Minotaur campaign](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/earth-minotaur-exploits-wechat-bugs-spyware-uyghurs) that used an exploit kit called Moonshine and the DarkNimbus malware for Android devices, aimed at compromising members of the Tibetan and Uyghur communities. Earlier in April, Five Eyes [issued a report](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Advisory-BADBAZAAR-and-MOONSHINE-guidance.pdf) that warned that the APT’s campaign against those ethnic groups was growing in its ferocity. It also flagged a claim from Intelligence Online that identified an ostensibly legitimate Chinese company called Dianke Network Security Technology (UPSEC) as the supplier of the DarkNimbus malware.\nIn the course of its recent analysis, ESET researchers fingerprinted DarkNimbus (which it calls DarkNights) as one of the tools that TheWizards uses to target mobile users in its ongoing campaign against gambling companies.\n\"While TheWizards uses a different backdoor for Windows (WizardNet), the hijacking server is configured to serve DarkNights [aka DarkNimbus] to updating applications running on Android devices,\" the researchers explained. \"While we have not seen any victims in ESET telemetry, we managed to obtain a malicious update instruction for the Android version of Tencent QQ. … This indicates that Dianke Network Security is a digital quartermaster to TheWizards APT group.\"\nWhile both threat actors use DarkNights/DarkNimbus malware, \"TheWizards has focused on different targets and uses infrastructure and additional tools (for example, Spellbinder and WizardNet) not observed to be used by Earth Minotaur,\" according to the research — which underscores an ongoing trend of disparate Chinese state-sponsored actors [sharing tools](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/chinese-apt-emperor-dragonfly-ransomware-attack) and resources from third-party suppliers, and in some cases [tag-teaming on their operations](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/chinese-tag-team-apts-keep-stealing-asian-govt-secrets).\nIn terms of defense, Boutin notes that ESET hasn't uncovered the initial access vector for deploying Spellbinder, but says that monitoring IPv6 traffic for unusual connection activity is a good indicator of compromise; otherwise, good endpoint security, including EDR or XDR, and keeping routers patched and up to date are good prophylactics. There are also known mitigations against SLAAC spoofing, including implementing [Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-2mt/ip6-send.html).\n\"TheWizards campaign is notable in the technological approaches it takes with abusing IPv6,\" Boutin said. \"It's not something you see often in the wild; also, the similarities to the Earth Minotaur group are notable — getting corroboration on the toolset being used in the wild is always of interest.\"\nRead more about:\n[DR Global Asia Pacific](https://www.darkreading.com/keyword/asia-pacific)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89b6fafcebe3eceafdb4dde1ecdee0f3e8fbedfaa9c8d9dda9cae8fafdfaa9e8a9daf9ece5e5a9e6e7a9c8fae0e8e7a9cee8e4ebe5ecfbfaa9dee0fde1a9c7e6ffece5a9c8fdfde8eae2afe8e4f9b2ebe6edf0b4c0acbbb9fde1e6fceee1fdacbbb9fde1ecacbbb9efe6e5e5e6fee0e7eeacbbb9effbe6e4acbbb9cde8fbe2acbbb9dbece8ede0e7eeacbbb9e4e0eee1fdacbbb9e0e7fdecfbecfafdacbbb9f0e6fca7acb9cdacb9c8acb9cdacb9c8acbbb9dde1ecdee0f3e8fbedfaacbbb9c8d9ddacbbb9cae8fafdfaacbbb9e8acbbb9daf9ece5e5acbbb9e6e7acbbb9c8fae0e8e7acbbb9cee8e4ebe5ecfbfaacbbb9dee0fde1acbbb9c7e6ffece5acbbb9c8fdfde8eae2acb9cdacb9c8e1fdfdf9faacbac8acbbcfacbbcffefefea7ede8fbe2fbece8ede0e7eea7eae6e4acbbcfeae5e6fceda4faeceafcfbe0fdf0acbbcffde1ecfee0f3e8fbedfaa4e8f9fda4e8fae0e8e7a4eee8e4ebe5ecfbfaa4e8fdfde8eae2)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/tara-seals)\n[Tara Seals](https://www.darkreading.com/author/tara-seals)\nManaging Editor, News, Dark Reading\nTara Seals has 20+ years of experience as a journalist, analyst and editor in the cybersecurity, communications and technology space.

However, it can be difficult to determine which items to prioritize and even more challenging to know which ones are necessary.\nOne prime example is implementing multifactor authentication (MFA) to bolster security and make it harder for attackers to gain initial access. While MFA is a highly important control to put in place, it is [not strong enough](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/evilginx-bypasses-mfa) on its own, warned Dan Gorecki, principal and CISO at NGC Risk at RSAC Conference 2025 this week in San Francisco.\n\"It's defense in-depth, super strong control, but it needs to work with a lot of other controls to be very effective,\" Gorecki said during his session, \"[Cybersecurity Myth-Busting: Fact vs. Fiction in Cyber Programs](https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us25/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1727286600727001Y7oC).\" \"We've seen with SIM swapping and other things that MFA, while a very strong control, is not enough.\"\n## Focus on Third Parties That Matter Most\nWith supply chain risks on the rise, made especially evident by last year's ransomware attack against United Health's Change Healthcare, organizations are increasingly tasked with third-party risk management. While it is important to stay updated on what's happening with third-party vendors — especially as risks rapidly evolve — the methods organizations are currently using can be improved and expanded beyond questionnaires that may be intentionally or unintentionally misleading.\nRelated:[A Cybersecurity Paradox: Even Resilient Organizations Are Blind to AI Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/even-resilient-organizations-bind-ai-threats)\n\"We want to get away from checkbox compliance, get above the floor, which means we have to ask the right questions, have the right size questionnaire, talk to the right people, and that is all very difficult,\" said Scott Brammer, cyber adviser for The Cyber Security Council and co-presenter of the myth-busting session. \"We want to focus on what matters.\"\nIn July, CrowdStrike issued a faulty update that led to widespread outages. The only fix was manual, so customers, [including airlines](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/delta-launches-500m-lawsuit-crowdstrike), experienced blue screens of death and prolonged downtimes. It was just another example of increasing supply chain risks with cascading effects. \n\"The EDR [endpoint detection and response] issue last July, that was a critical vulnerability because they're at the kernel level,\" Brammer said. \"Those are the parties you want to make sure you understand their processes and try to get as close to as being active without their internal worldview as you can.\"\nRelated:[DoJ Data Security Program Highlights Data-Sharing Challenges](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/doj-data-security-program-data-sharing-challenge)\n## Is Insurance Driving Compliance?\nCyber insurance continues to play a larger role in an organization's security posture. Insurance can help during a ransomware attack, provide legal counsel, and alert policyholders to new risks in their environment. It has become so integral that many organizations contact insurance first, even before law enforcement, during or after an attack.\nPolicies also heavily [influence compliance](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/-skinny-cyber-insurance-policies-create-compliance-path) because organizations need to have many protocols and security standards in place to be insurable. As to whether \"insurability is the new compliance,\" Gorecki and Brammer said, \"It's plausible.\"\nOrganizations now respond more quickly to a cyber insurer, compared to an internal audit or compliance request, Brammer said.\n\"Insurers are beginning to become arbiters of compliance,\" he added. \"If a mom-and-pop shop wants to go or stay in business, they have to be insurable, but they may not have to be compliant. That's a weird distinction going on in our social economic environment right now.\"\nWhile insurance can help, organizations should be wary of compliance being just a checklist.\n\"For us, the key thing is the insurance landscape continues to change, and as underwriters reallocate our risks, we do need to understand what your policy covers and doesn't,\" Gorecki said.\nRelated:[Could Ransomware Survive Without Cryptocurrency?](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/ransomware-would-adapt-without-cryptocurrency)\n## CISO's Evolving Role\nThe presenters determined that only one of the seven myths they addressed during the session was \"confirmed\" — that \"CISOs are business and culture leaders first and technology leaders second.\"\nWhile cyber and IT security grew out of technology, the industry could be moving toward an inflection point where it's shifting, Gorecki indicated. CISOs should be seen as business leaders and not just technology leaders because it's important to recognize how both security and business outcomes can align.\n\"We need to rethink what a cyber professional really is,\" he said. \"It really is around change management; it's not about tech or red teaming.

The source of the outage is still not totally clear, though it is being blamed on a [rare atmospheric condition](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/power-outage-europe-atmosphere-cause/83330424007/). So far, early reports that it was a [Russian cyberattack](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/no-evidence-of-cyberattack-in-eu-blackout-rare-atmospheric-phenomenon-identified-by-ren-as-cause/ar-AA1DPgna) were said to be false, and the incident remains under investigation.\nRelated:['Lemon Sandstorm' Underscores Risks to Middle East Infrastructure](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/lemon-sandstorm-risks-middle-east-infrastructure)\n## Lures of Compensation for Flights\nThe [campaign](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/phishing-attack-in-ukraine-could-be-prelude-to-disinformation-campaign), which is hosted via compromised WordPress sites, sends emails mimicking TAP Air Portugal official communciations that contain lures of compensation for delayed or lost flights.\nThe emails targeting Portuguese speakers have a subject line, \"Atualização de compensação: atraso em seu voo recente,\" which translates in English to: \"Compensation update: delay in your flight.\" Spanish speakers received emails with the similar subject line \"Compensación por su vuelo: Complete su solicitud ahora,\" which translates in English to \"Compensation for your flight: Complete your application now.\"\nThe content of the emails tells recipients that they may be eligible for a refund due to the European Union's \"Air Passengers Rights Regulation.\" If they fill out a form found via an embedded link, they will receive compensation directly in their bank account within two working days, according to the messages.\nThe link, however, leads not to a legitimate form but a [phishing page](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/one-click-phishing-campaign-high-profile-x-accounts), according to Cofense. \"Victims are prompted to provide sensitive information and credit card details on the credential phishing page under the guise of refunds for delayed and cancelled flights,\" Marie Mamaril of the Cofense Intelligence Team wrote in the post.\nRelated:[Play Ransomware Group Used Windows Zero-Day](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/play-ransomware-group-windows-zero-day)\nIf a recipient clicks on the link and fills out the form, they will submit these personal details to the threat actor. There is no further redirect once the form is submitted, suggesting that data harvesting is the only intent of the actor, she noted.\n## Current Events Fuel Socially Engineered Campaigns\nThe campaign is indicative of a common trend among threat actors in which they take advantage of [current events](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/sophisticated-rat-p-diddy-scandal-lures) in [socially engineered](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/the-rise-of-social-engineering-fraud-in-business-email-compromise) attacks against people who are vulnerable to persuasion and more susceptible to Internet-based fraud. The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/new-rat-lurks-behind-covid-phishing-lures) was a prime example of this, when numerous phishing and other malicious campaigns over several years aimed at taking advantage of the global situation to target victims.\nTo avoid compromise, especially during times of stress or concern over a current event, people should be especially wary of opening any emails or other forms of communication related to the event from those unknown to them, especially ones offering financial assistance or compensation.\nAs a general rule, it's helpful for anyone using the Internet to be aware of the key signs of phishing or other malicious online communications and the social engineering tactics that attackers use, such as offering financial offers or rewards that appear to be too good to be true, or exclusive access to other special gifts or discounts.\nRelated:[Researcher Says Patched Commvault Bug Still Exploitable](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/researcher-patched-commvault-bug-exploitable)\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/elizabeth-montalbano)\n[Elizabeth Montalbano, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/elizabeth-montalbano)\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

The upshot? The goal of CISA is not to solve every problem. The agency, as well as the federal government writ large, will focus on enforcement.\nNoem took over DHS at a time when some in conservative circles were calling for the complete obliteration of the agency in retaliation for CISA's role in pushing back on claims the 2020 election was stolen, as well as its perceived policing of information being shared during the COVID-19 pandemic. She added during her remarks yesterday that she holds the goal of the agency in high regard: to harden the US defenses. But the agency will no longer operate as a \"ministry of truth,\" she added.\n\"The materials generated by CISA were clearly inappropriate,\" Noem said. \"We are going to get back on mission.\"\nCISA has also [cut back its efforts to secure US elections](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/how-cisa-cuts-impact-election-security).\n## CISA Cost Cuts\nNoem and the newly [nominated CISA Director Sean Plankey](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/trump-sean-plankey-cisa-director), who she insisted will be confirmed despite pushback in the Senate, are focused on cutting costs. The new CISA headquarters that was slated to be built was put on hold by the new administration, Noem explained. She also chided the media for covering CISA cuts in what she views as a negative light rather than effective cost-savings measures that will benefit taxpayers, something Noem said she takes very seriously in her role. So far, she said, she has cut $10 million from the CISA budget, but she added there are also plans to invest where it makes sense.\nRelated:[Countries Begin NATO's Locked Shields Cyber-Defense Exercise](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/countries-nato-locked-shields-cyber-defense-exercise)\nAsked what specific additional services will come online over the next few years, Noem said the industry will see when President Trump releases his budget. She stressed cybersecurity is something the Trump administration is deeply committed to.\nThe agency will continue to share threat intelligence and work actively to find ways to partner with the private sector, Noem added.\nContinuing public-private information sharing will also remain a priority, Noem said, calling for the renewal of [ISAC agreements](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/isac-101-unlocking-the-power-of-information) along with some updates that offer some enforcement protections for organizations working in good faith to share threat intel with the government.\nWhen CISA was started six years ago, Neom explained there wasn't a blueprint to work from. Now, however, the agency can use its experience to reevaluate what's working and what isn't. That's where she's asking for the private sector's help.\nRelated:[TikTok Fined €530 Million Over Chinese Access to EU Data](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/tiktok-fined-530-million-eu-data-servers-china)\n\"We need to hear from you as well,\" she said. \"This is an opportunity to do big things. You have a seat at the table.\"\nWhen it comes to bad actors, Noem said DHS and CISA will be focused on making them pay a price in a way that the private sector can't. But she warned that the agency wasn't going to try and solve every problem. Rather than regulating the sector, Noem expressed an interest in setting up \"guardrails\" rather than trying to control the private cybersecurity sector.\n\"The goal of CISA is to be operational,\" Noem said, adding the caveat, \"Washington, DC, doesn't have all the answers. We need a vision of how we can be much more efficient.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#112e6264737b7472652c55594231537e6262315f7e747c31477e666231657e315674653152584250315370727a3137326923262a5e7f315c786262787e7f37326923262a37707c612a737e75682c5834232165797e64767965342321657974342321777e7d7d7e66787f7634232177637e7c3423215570637a34232143747075787f763423217c78767965342321787f657463746265342321687e643f342155342150342155342150342321555942342321537e62623423215f7e747c342321477e6662342321657e342321567465342321525842503423215370727a34232137326923262a5e7f3423215c786262787e7f37326923262a34215534215079656561623422503423573423576666663f7570637a63747075787f763f727e7c342357726873746362747264637865683c7e6174637065787e7f623423577579623c6274726374657063683c7f7e747c3c727862703c7370727a3c7e7f3c7c786262787e7f)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\n[Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nSenior Editor, Dark Reading, Dark Reading\nBecky Bracken is a veteran multimedia journalist covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\n[See more from Becky Bracken](https://www.darkreading.com/author/becky-bracken)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Participants included Kathleen Fisher, Office Director, Information Innovation Office at the US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Rob McHenry, Acting Director at DARPA; Vincent Tang, Deputy Director at Advanced Research Projects Agency for Infrastructure (ARPA-I); and Jennifer Roberts, Director of Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).\nCritical infrastructure is, of course, a major, ongoing concern in security. The last few years have seen [the Colonial Pipeline attack](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/2-years-after-colonial-pipeline-attack-us-critical-infrastructure-remains-as-vulnerable-to-ransomware), a large number of severe critical infrastructure attacks Russia conducted in its invasion of Ukraine, and [breaches of major US telecom companies](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/chinas-salt-typhoon-cyberattacks-us-isps) by the Chinese nation-state threat group Salt Typhoon.\nThe net for critical infrastructure attacks feels like it gets wider by the day; engineering and services company Spartan Corp held a session at RSAC yesterday covering [the unique threats faced by satellites and other space assets](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/hacking-space-not-tough). \nRelated:['Venom Spider' Targets Hiring Managers in Phishing Scheme](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/venom-spider-phishing-scheme)\n## The Wide Net of Critical Infrastructure Risks\n\"Critical infrastructure\" is a very broad term, representing 16 categories: chemicals, commercial facilities, communications, critical manufacturing, dams, defense industrial base, emergency services, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, information technology, nuclear (reactors, materials, and waste), transportation, and water.\nEach of those categories alone is massive; for example, McHenry said there are more than 55,000 independent water processing districts in the United States. Tang, meanwhile, explained how there are more than 300,000 traffic signals in the US, and these signals come from a number of independent vendors with different versions of software and firmware. That doesn't even account for how many of these signals are (or use) legacy products.\nFor the healthcare sector, Roberts explained that 90% of health and biotech software contains open source code, and \"about 40% of that is known to include vulnerabilities.\"\nRelated:[A Cybersecurity Paradox: Even Resilient Organizations Are Blind to AI Threats](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/even-resilient-organizations-bind-ai-threats)\nIn addition, Roberts highlighted dangers to hospitals. She explained that a large number of vulnerabilities are present in hospital systems already, and on top of that, a third of the nation's hospitals are already at risk of going bankrupt.\n\"If you think about the risk of a cyberattack to a hospital system, especially in a rural area, it's quite high,\" she said. \"We have seen incidents where hospitals have closed because of the ransomware attack.\"\nShe said the challenge here is to leverage technological advances to find and fix vulnerabilities while making it significantly easier to deploy fixes in a trustworthy way. That comes against the reality, Roberts said, that rural hospitals operate at very tight margins, creating staffing limitations.\nRoberts added that compared with other, more IT-centric technologies, medical devices like CT scanners, MRIs, and pacemakers need to run continuously, creating a higher standard to address vulnerabilities.\nOn the transportation end, Tang said critical infrastructure here means roads, highways, ports, railroads, pipelines, as well as air travel with the Federal Aviation Administration. Tang said the Department of Transportation has done \"a lot of work\" making tools and assessments for the wider transportation community, but \"there's lots of opportunity for breakthrough technologies in this space to help handle that,\" such as automation. The balance, he said, is to \"not miss out\" on new capabilities like AI but remain secure at the same time.\nRelated:[Prolific RansomHub Operation Goes Dark](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/prolific-ransomhub-operation-goes-dark)\nMcHenry said it's important to secure infrastructure in part because of the US's adversaries; he said China \"is explicit in their strategies about penetrating and degrading US infrastructure to degrade the will of the United States to compete and, if necessary, win a conflict with China.\"\n## Addressing Critical Infrastructure Risks\nCritical infrastructure security is a far-reaching, massive problem to address, made more challenging through regulatory issues that (at least somewhat necessarily) pose challenges to making rapid, sweeping changes. However, sectors are adapting in their own ways.\nFor example, ARPA-H launched a $50 million program last year called \"Upgrade,\" which represents research into developing a series of tools to detect vulnerabilities and patch automatically. There are other efforts in ARPA-H, such as one dedicated to patching medical devices and another focused on early detection of ransomware attacks in hospitals. \nOn the transportation side, Tang reinforced the opportunities with automation — which can work with different code bases — and said ARPA-I was looking into which open source software packages organizations were using.\nFor healthcare, Roberts said there are discussions about liability when something goes wrong with a medical device — for example, during the patching process or with unaddressed vulnerabilities. \"There are a lot of thoughtful folks at the FDA thinking through the implications there,\" she said.\nMcHenry said that another consideration DARPA is making is how to develop code that is secure in the original development process. As part of this aim, DARPA developed a number of best-practice guides that it is [starting to publicly release](https://defencescienceinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Resilient_Systems_Best_Practices_Guide_-_1-9-2025.pdf). Moreover, it is implementing these secure software methodologies as evaluation criteria for research funding, and McHenry said DARPA is working to scale its cybersecurity development standards across the DoD as a whole.\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bb84c8ced9d1ded8cf86fffae9ebfa9bf3d2dcd3d7d2dcd3cfc89bf8c9d2cfd2d8dad79bf2d5ddc9dac8cfc9ced8cfcec9de9be8ded8cec9d2cfc29bf8d3dad7d7ded5dcdec89ddad6cb80d9d4dfc286f29e898bcfd3d4cedcd3cf9e898bcfd3de9e898bddd4d7d7d4ccd2d5dc9e898bddc9d4d69e898bffdac9d09e898be9dedadfd2d5dc9e898bd6d2dcd3cf9e898bd2d5cfdec9dec8cf9e898bc2d4ce959e8bff9e8bfa9e8bff9e8bfa9e898bfffae9ebfa9e898bf3d2dcd3d7d2dcd3cfc89e898bf8c9d2cfd2d8dad79e898bf2d5ddc9dac8cfc9ced8cfcec9de9e898be8ded8cec9d2cfc29e898bf8d3dad7d7ded5dcdec89e8bff9e8bfad3cfcfcbc89e88fa9e89fd9e89fdcccccc95dfdac9d0c9dedadfd2d5dc95d8d4d69e89fdd8c2d9dec996c9d2c8d09e89fddfdac9cbda96d3d2dcd3d7d2dcd3cfc896d8c9d2cfd2d8dad796d2d5ddc9dac8cfc9ced8cfcec9de96c8ded8cec9d2cfc296d8d3dad7d7ded5dcdec8)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\n[Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nDark Reading\nAlex is a writer, journalist, and podcaster based in Boston.\n[See more from Alexander Culafi, Senior News Writer, Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/alexander-culafi)\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly discovered vulnerabilities, data breach information, and emerging trends.

Worse, a skilled attacker could rapidly toggle the ATG's relays, potentially frying them or damaging the gear they control, like pumps and alarms, he says. \n\"Gas stations would need to shut down, at least temporarily. And so would backup generators from critical infrastructure,\" he tells Dark Reading. \"A small-scale attack on ATGs can have cascading effects that are much worse than the immediate effect.\"\nAs an example, Umbelino points to the infamous May 2021 ransomware attack on [Colonial Pipeline](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/2-years-after-colonial-pipeline-attack-us-critical-infrastructure-remains-as-vulnerable-to-ransomware) that led to major fuel shortages across the US east coast driven by panic buying. \"The attackers never accessed industrial controls directly, but the social panic triggered the broader crisis nevertheless.\"\nRelated:[AWWA Supports Introduction of Collaborative Cybersecurity Legislation](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/awwa-introduction-cybersecurity-legislation)\nUmbelino points to companies like Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Dover Fueling Solutions, Franklin Fueling Systems, OPW Fuel Management Systems, and Alisonic as some of major suppliers of fuel tank monitoring systems. Some of these systems run on embedded Linux or real-time operating systems and others run on proprietary firmware, he says. Updating these systems can be cumbersome, sometimes needing physical intervention from a specialized technician. Other models don't have updates anymore, as they are end of life, Umbelino points out.\n## Familiar Concerns\nConcerns about cyberattacks on gas tank monitoring systems are not new. In 2015, security researcher HD Moore, best known for creating the Metasploit penetration testing framework, warned about many of the same consequences in a blog post titled [The Internet of Gas Station Tank Gauges](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/01/22/the-internet-of-gas-station-tank-gauges/).\nMoore's research focused primarily on ATGs that are accessible over the Internet via TCP port 10001 — something that operators often enable to monitor and program their ATGs. Moore reported finding some 5,800 ATGs, including 5,300 of them in the US, exposed to the Internet via this port without so much as a password, leaving them vulnerable to an array of attacks. The majority of the exposed systems belonged to retail gas stations, including those affiliated with major brands and franchises, convenience store, and truck stops.\nRelated:[If Boards Don't Fix OT Security, Regulators Will](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/boards-fix-ot-security-regulators)\nLater the same year, researchers at Trend Micro [deployed honeypots that mimicked Internet-connected ATGs](https://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/gas-stations-in-the-bullseye) to both understand and to highlight how frequently threat actors scanned for and targeted these devices. The security vendor's \"Gaspot\" research underscored the real world risks that unsecured, Internet-exposed ATGs present to their owners and operators.\n## Bigger Attack Surface\nThe problem has only gotten worse since then, not better. A [2022 study by researchers at Cyborg](https://intel471.com/blog/a-theoretically-devastating-cyber-attack-on-americas-gas-stations#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20Potential%20Attack%20Surface,ATGs%20from%202017%20to%202022.&text=With%20potentially%2011%2C000%20ATGs%20insecurely,resided%20in%20the%20United%20States!&text=Drilling%20down%20deeper%2C%20Shodan%20graphically,out%20to%20find%20the%20answer.) found a startling 120% increase in ATGs that were insecurely connected to the Internet via port 10001 – from 5,800 in Moore's study to over 11,000. Nearly two-thirds of these devices belonged to organizations in the US. Many of the Internet-exposed systems were also manufactured by Gilbarco Veeder-Root.\n[New research by BitSight](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-discovered-automated-tank-gauge-systems) in 2024 showed that even current ATG models with administrative Web interfaces often contain easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities that give complete control to an attacker. In a single week last year, Bitsight discovered as many as 11 vulnerabilities in six ATG models from multiple vendors. The flaws included OS command injection flaws, authentication bypass issues, privilege escalation, and SQL injection bugs. Two of the vulnerabilities, [CVE-2024-45066](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45066) and [CVE-2024-43693](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43693), in MagLink LX ATGs were assigned a maximum severity score of 10 on the CVSS scale; five had scores that ranged between 9 and 10; and the remaining were of less critical severity.\nRelated:[Emerging Risks Require IT/OT Collaboration to Secure Physical Systems](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/experts-discuss-current-and-emerging-ics-security-risks)\nUmbelino says the vulnerabilities that Bitsight uncovered enables damage that goes beyond things like pump disablement, changing tank information, switching labels and disabling alarms. \"Bitsight demonstrated relay burnout under load is possible, so physically damaging an ATG device is a real possibility,\" he says.\nSo too is damage to the peripherals connected to them, which could potentially have more serious consequences. \"Ventilation systems, emergency shutoff valves, alarm sirens, and pumps are just some of the devices that can be connected to the relays, which likely won’t react nicely to being turned on and off several times per second,\" he notes.\n## Easy to Find and Exploit\nOften, all it takes for an attacker to find a vulnerable fuel tanking monitoring system is to use a tool like Shodan to search for them, Umbelino says. And when a password might exist to protect access, it usually is the default \"123456\" password. While search tools like Shodan may not always provide full visibility into all Internet-reachable devices, they still provide enough information for an attacker to conduct potentially disruptive attacks. \"Even basic reconnaissance can reveal exploitable targets with zero authentication and full physical impact potential,\" Umbelino says.\n\"For a security researcher, like myself, who likes both hardware and software, with a special interest in ICS/OT security, it was very cool to physically damage these devices remotely,\" he jokes.\nBut what is really worrisome is an attacker doesn't really have to blow anything up to cause havoc. All they need is access. \"What do you think would happen if hundreds of gas stations across the country would stop?\" he asks. \"There are thousands of them exposed on the Internet right now, just a packet away from disruption.\"\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n## About the Author\n[](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\n[Jai Vijayan, Contributing Writer](https://www.darkreading.com/author/jai-vijayan)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

    "content": "The only thing that's certain about the current tariff situation is that a lot of things are about to get more expensive for U.S. consumers. The impact of the new tariffs is estimated to be more than [$5,000 per year](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-inflation-rate-economy/ \"open in a new window\") for the average household, which means all the work you've put into figuring out your home budget and personal finances is going to go out the window. All the metrics are about to change--and mostly not in your favor.\nIf you're smart, you already have an [emergency fund](https://lifehacker.com/heres-how-much-money-you-should-have-in-your-emergency-1850070761) to protect yourself against life's little surprises, from a job loss to an unexpected [medical bill](https://lifehacker.com/always-ask-these-three-questions-before-paying-a-medica-1850415814). Right now, it's also a good idea to start building a fund to protect yourself against sudden and persistent tariff-fueled hikes in the cost of living. Here's how to approach setting up a tariff emergency fund.\n## How to estimate what tariffs will cost you\nTariff rates are public information, but tariff schedules can be a difficult read if you're not an economist. But you can use a few key pieces of information to figure out how much extra money to set aside to protect yourself from tariff-related cost increases:\n  * **Blanket tariffs.** There's pretty much a base tariff of 10% on just about every country in the world at the moment (the big exception is China, which currently faces tariffs as high as 145%). You can see a list of countries and tariff rates [here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-tariffs-list-pause \"open in a new window\"), so if you know that something you buy is being imported from a specific place, you can see the extra cost imposed on the importer for that country of origin. This is a good upper metric to go by.\n  * **Average cost increase.** Most companies will pass tariff costs on to the consumer in some way--that's why tariffs are considered a form of tax on the consumer. That doesn't necessarily mean that everything will be 10% more expensive due to the blanket tariffs, because a product may only use a few ingredients or components that are subject to the tariffs, and different ingredients might come in under different tariff rates. The Budget Lab at Yale University has calculated that consumer prices are going to [go up by about 3%](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025 \"open in a new window\") as a result of the tariffs, so that's a good lower metric to use.\n\n\n## How to create your tariff emergency fund\nYou could spend time researching tariff rates and where your food, clothing, and other items come from in order to craft an extremely specific tariff fund, and then look for domestic products you can substitute to eliminate the tariff costs from your budget. But the way the tariffs are shifting on a near-daily basis means you might do better to skip that meticulous product-by-product analysis and just assume that your costs are going to go up by anywhere from 3% to 10% on just about everything. \n### Assume a blanket increase\nTargeting something in the middle of that range--say, 5% of your current household grocery and shopping costs--should give you the extra padding you're going to need as long as these tariffs remain in place. For example, if your average grocery bill is [about $500](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-much-should-i-spend-on-groceries \"open in a new window\") per month, a tariff emergency grocery fund of about $180 (3% of $500 is $15, multiplied by 12 months) would cover a year's worth of extra tariff-related costs (or you could try to find a supermarket that's [not raising prices at all](https://lifehacker.com/money/where-to-grocery-shop-to-avoid-price-increases-from-tariffs), if you can). If you want a little more protection against unexpected costs, you could go the full 10% and make that $300. You can apply a similar formula to everything else you purchase on a regular basis that could be impacted by tariffs.\n### Budget for the big ticket items\nAnother option is to consider major purchases you're planning for--say, a new refrigerator or a home remodeling project--and setting aside extra money to cover possible increased costs. Consumer Reports estimates [appliance prices could increase by as much as 30% to 40% over the next 9 months](https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/how-to-save-if-tariffs-raise-prices-on-tech-and-appliances-a1128872110/ \"open in a new window\"), so you'll want to be ready: If you were planning on buying a refrigerator with a price tag of around $2,000,.stick another $600 to $800 into your tariff emergency fund. \n### Just set aside $5,000\nAnother approach would be to assume the tariffs will cost you about $5,000 per year, and start putting that amount aside to cover the increased costs, if you can manage it. It's important that this be a separate amount from your emergency fund, which you still need to maintain to hedge against, well, emergencies--and if tariffs are lowered or you don't spend as much as you expect, you can roll it into next year's fund, or add it to your regular emergency fund.\nPreparing for tariff chaos isn't going to be easy, but putting aside some extra money now will give you the necessary runway to handle what's coming.",
