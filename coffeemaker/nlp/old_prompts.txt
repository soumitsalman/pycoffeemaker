#   Extract key points, events, data points, geo regions, entities, domains, and topic from the article, aligning with its core narrative. Ensure concise, structured output, ignoring irrelevant content and adhering to constraints. Use "N/A" for undecipherable elements.

# CONSTRAINTS
#   Ignore: Boilerplate, ads, subscription links, generic prompts (e.g., “Discuss”), unless tied to narrative.
#   Pub Date: Use only for event tense (past/future), not as data point.
#   Spec/Relev: Extract specific, impactful, text-grounded elements supporting the thesis.
#   N/A: Apply to key points, events, data points if not identifiable.
#   Geo: Extract regions for events/data points; use “N/A” if none.

# EXTRACTIONS
# Key Points:
#   Def: Declarative statements of core arguments/claims.
#   Struct: [Subject] + [Action/Problem] + [Implication] (e.g., Problem: [Field] lacks [X], causing [Y]; Claim: [Subject] must [Action] for [Impact]).

#   N/A: If none, list “N/A”.

# Data Points:
#   Def: Quantifiable details contextualizing events/arguments.

#   Def: Named people, orgs, tech/concepts, products, vulnerabilities, diseases.
#   Chars: Narrative-relevant, excludes minor mentions.
#   N/A: If only pub/author names, list “N/A”.

# Domains:
#   Def: Fields like AI, Cybersecurity, Business, Economics.
#   Chars: Reflect article focus, primary/secondary.
#   N/A: If none coherent.

# Topic:
#   Def: 2–4 word summary of narrative.
#   N/A: If no coherent content.

# INSTRUCTIONS
#   Cross-Ref: Link data points to events/points (e.g., funding to neglect).
#   Validate: Confirm accuracy, specificity, relevance.
#   Tense: Use pub date, for past/current vs. future/proposed.
#   Geo Precision: Prefer specific (e.g., “London, UK” over “UK”); “N/A” if unclear.
#   Align: Elements must support thesis, avoid tangents.

# # GOAL:
# Extract the key points, key events, data points, geographic regions, entities, domains and topic from the provided article, ensuring relevance to the core content and alignment with the article’s primary narrative. The extraction should be systematic, concise, and structured, discarding irrelevant content and adhering to specified constraints. If certain elements cannot be identified, indicate "N/A" as required.

# # CONSTRAINTS:
# Irrelevant Content: Disregard website boilerplate, advertisements, subscription/sign-up links, related articles, and generic prompts (e.g., “Discuss,” “Contact Us”) unless they contain core narrative details.
# Publication Date: Treat the article’s publication date as irrelevant as a data point unless it informs the tense of events (e.g., past vs. future actions).
# Specificity: Prioritize specific, impactful, and text-grounded information over vague or speculative statements.
# Relevance: All extracted elements must directly support the article’s core narrative or thesis.
# N/A Handling: If key points, key events, or data points cannot be deciphered from the article, respond with "N/A" in the respective section.
# Geographic Regions: Extract regions tied to key events and data points. If no region can be deciphered, respond with "N/A" for that element.

# # EXTRACTION PROCESS:
# 1. Key Points: Concise, declarative statements capturing the core arguments, claims, or concepts central to the article’s narrative.
#   Structure: [Subject/Concept] + [Action/Claim/Problem] + [Implication/Context]

#     Risk Warnings: [Subject/Action] + [causes/risks] + [Negative Outcome] + [Context]
#   Characteristics:
#     Relevant to the core narrative.
#     Specific, avoiding vague or overly broad statements.
#     Impactful, with significant implications for the article’s thesis.
#     Text-grounded, derived from explicit statements or emphasized sections.
#   N/A Case: If no key points can be identified, list “N/A” in the Key Points section.

# 2. Key Events: Specific occurrences or actions (past, present, or proposed) that illustrate or advance the article’s narrative.
#   Characteristics:
#     Specific, with clear details (e.g., named organizations, dates, or actionable steps).
#     Relevant to the core narrative, supporting the thesis or proposed solutions.
#     Text-grounded, avoiding speculative or vague actions.
#   N/A Case: If no key events can be identified, list “N/A” in the Key Events section.

# 3. Data Points: Quantifiable or specific details that influence or contextualize the events, actions, or arguments in the article.
#   Syntactical Patterns:
#     Numerical Quantities with Context: [Subject/Action] + [Numerical Value] + [Unit/Qualifier] + [Context/Impact]

#     Benchmark or Research References: [Research/Action] + [Specific Output] + [Purpose/Impact]
#   Characteristics:
#     Measurable or concrete (e.g., funding amounts, timelines).
#     Directly tied to key events or arguments.
#     Excludes irrelevant details (e.g., publication date as a standalone data point).
#   N/A Case: If no data points can be identified, list “N/A” in the Data Points section.

# 4. Geographic Regions: Locations (e.g., cities, countries) associated with key events and data points.
#   Characteristics:
#     Specific to the event or data point (e.g., “London, UK” for a conference).
#     Listed as “N/A” if no region is decipherable from the text.
#   N/A Case: If no specific geographic region is specified in the article

# 5. Entities: Key People, Companies/Organizations, Technologies/Concepts,  Products/Services, Security Vulnerability, Disease etc. mentioned in the article.

# 6. Domains: Broad fields or disciplines relevant to the article’s content (e.g., Cybersecurity, AI, Software Engineering, Business, Ethics).

# # ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
# Cross-Referencing: Ensure data points are linked to key events or points they support (e.g., funding data contextualizing an event).
# Validation: Re-check the text to confirm accuracy, specificity, and relevance of all extracted elements.
# Tense Contextualization: Use the article’s publication date or the current date (May 05, 2025) to categorize events as past/current or future/proposed, but do not list the publication date as a data point unless it directly influences the narrative.
# Specificity: Prioritize detailed events (e.g., named conferences with dates) over vague actions (e.g., “raise awareness”) unless part of a broader, specific plan.
# Geographic Precision: Extract regions as specifically as possible (e.g., “London, UK” rather than “UK” if mentioned). Use “N/A” for events or data points without clear location details.
# Narrative Alignment: All elements must support the article’s core thesis, avoiding tangential or minor details.
